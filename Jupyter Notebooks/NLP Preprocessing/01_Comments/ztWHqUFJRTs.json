Enjoying nature is actually better for nature btw. Like hunting.  Hunting raises money for conservation, and yes has proven to work. Or trophy hunting. Which keeps the poachers out. once Africa decided NO trophy hunting, but then all the poachers came in and ruined it all. Hunting is enjoying nature. and it helps it too", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "The Jurassic Chicken", "channel": "UCyUZ_L2FAinQY-7YtLx6-PA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQg1ux0llowGCcrNYy6kBEExf6w1_e_BJM5w-Ag8g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugxi3TbnYT9RjJyfoid4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

The answer is that none of the 'White Countries' are being invaded, conquered, taken by other races. Sure, people come to our fair shores in hope of better life, but they are by no means a majority.

Certainly, the concentration of these gases is increasing and sometimes temperature does as well. Of course, as in the case of the last 17+ years CO2 has been increasing and yet temperature has been flat to lower.\n¬†\nWe can measure how much CO2 and other greenhouse gases are in the astmosphere. We can measure temperture. However, we cannot measure how much human actiivty contributes to the observed change in climate and that is the key question. Absent instruments that can provide this answer we have to rely on computer models. Unfortunately, as of now there is no model(s) that accurately simulates observed climate variations. This indicates that the basic theory incorporated in the models is inadequate and the science is definitely not settled. Without verified models it is nonsensical to use their output for policy decisions.\nSome point to weather anomolies and try to argue that they are due to human activities. What do we find? Are things getting worse? Looking at 60 years of tornado data, 120 years of hurricane data or droughts over the past 1,000 years there is no evidence that it is gloom and doom time.\n\nSo, at this point we have not direct evidence or verified computer models to support the claim that human activities are a significant factor in changing climate. Nobody disagrees that human activities do contribute to some extent to climate change but there is no evidence that this is a significant effect. This is not a good basis for policy decisions.\n\nTo be sure, however, we should not stand still.

It is one cause (not the only one!) of the warming, and it's likely the largest player being that statistics have shown that the increase of CO2 and increase in global temperature (we're talking tenths of a degree average) correlate. Physics agrees as well, being that light can be absorbed by various molecules, their shape, size and density dictates what \"color\" they absorb, and appear to be (red paint used to use Iron for coloring). CO2 happens to love infrared, the wavelength most notably associated with direct heat. But not at the wavelengths the sun produces, those are much too small (high frequency), it's not until the earth absorbs and re-releases its own infrared energy that CO2 \"shines\". The earth, being much cooler, gives much longer wavelengths (lower frequency). This makes it easier for CO2 to absorb. In a nutshell, heat from the sun gets in freely, heat from the earth gets trapped. Hence the term \"greenhouse effect\"", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Calvin DiBartolo", "channel": "UCQ3STyKVQBmwPLlQJ9wu2WA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSoMOAZqkDM8p0Fncl1WKGEnr0D3vshCcuIWeB2=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
