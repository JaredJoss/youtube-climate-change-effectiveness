The way we generally act today (i.e. buying products off the shelves of stores without knowing how they got there or even what they are, and keep consuming without worrying about what we're actually doing when we consume) has also got some underlying motivations, namely we are chasing wellbeing/reward/satisfaction/happiness. It is a self-centered motive. Protect, restore, and fund are actions that stem from a caring desire, they are fostering and supportive actions which come from a much more care-oriented standpoint, or more parenting standpoint. \n\nI guess I'm not gonna go too far in saying that it is us in the first place who have generated this system that keeps us in a vicious cycle of evermore childish behaviours. This is really a call to our adulthood, which means waking up to our personal responsibility and personal power. We need to become organized and learn to connect and collaborate with each other.

{"cid": "UgyooICm-5geeEsyWOx4AaABAg", "text": "There are sooooo many things wrong in this video that it's hard to debunk it with a single comment and no more than 10 lines. I'll thus cite only a couple of reasons why the statements made on the video above are absurdly damn wrong:\n1. Trees spend 12 hours converting CO2 in O2 and the next 12 hours converting O2 in CO2. Therefore, trees are not the \"lungs of the planet\", they are not \"oxygen makers\".\n2. Our atmosphere currently has 400ppm of CO2. Plants need at least 150ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere in order to live. If we reduce the CO2 concentration to a level below 150ppm, our plants will first starve, then stop growing, then die. Ironically, this will destroy the very same environment that these \"environmentalists\" state that they're trying to save.

There is a self-running natural bio-intelligent cycle on Earth that has been around for a very long time and is not about to stop anytime soon... regardless if we are around or not. Weather systems of Earth are constantly changing adjusting themselves to the Harmony of the cycles. Nothing never stay the same...ALL things are in constant movements...that is why adaptability is the key to the survival of a organism...you adapt to your environment...you don't try to change the environment to your so poorly evaluated established philosophies of thinking... especially if they are base on a very poorly designed economical system thriving on high abusive consumerism consequenting in the abusive exploitation of our limited resources and poisoning our Water...Air...Grounds in the process.

And EARTH...what a Place to do so!\nWe must rethink our Systems...OUR very own Existence depends on IT.\n...And there is So Much Hope...We must give power to the Young spirits...and reestablish the equality between male and female Energy...

The EU imports 6 million tons for bio fuel. The Brazilians have been clear cutting for decades and in 1975 90% of their vehicles ran on sugar produced ethanol (it's now 75%). While Brazil does clear cut for cattle as well as crops, clear cutting elsewhere is mostly done for wood and crops and not cattle. Yes, I understand about the runoff from farms and like all man made problems they are fixable. \r\nThere isn't a climate catastrophe. This has been asserted repeatedly but there isn't. Please see Hans Rosling‚Äôs book 'Factfulness' Chapter 10 'The Urgency Instinct'. Hans Rosling tells how Al Gore said \"We need to create fear!\" In other words, exaggerate, or lie. \r\nThere are a minimum of 6 climate zones on earth (not one) and they are all still there, including the sub climates. The numbers of people dying from natural events keeps on diminishing with the biggest killers in recent years being earthquakes and tsunamis. However, 7,000 years ago the earth was hotter than now and was hotter still during the Eemian when CO2 was about 300ppm, less than now. The latest data from Mauna Lao shows CO2 continuing to increase in spite of the huge drop in human produced CO2.

And thousands of people protesting CAN make pressure on our so called leaders, that has been proved in the past. So If this girl is making It possible to change what is terrible, then It's your job to stop trying to find the 5th leg of a cat. A cat has 4 legs. End of story. And If capitalism makes you angry, guess what, you have YouTube and that sadly makes you a capitalist already. We are all puppets of something which is not even capitalism anymore. Beyond any kind of political stance we are puppets trapped by ambition and a society created by lunatics, and now we must try to become free of this cage by generating pressure and understanding what's important, even if It doesn't work.

Money, if environmental friendliness is where the money is at, that's where they will go.\n\n\nThis exact process is why the average American is living a higher quality of life than some of the richest people in history 1000 years ago, because innovation and competition made such a life style cheap, while also making us rich.\n\n\nIf people really cared about the safety of cars, companies would start putting seat belts or what not in cars, which is something that was already in progress before regulations.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "John Peric", "channel": "UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT68GrZP4pMCQxFt1i9y17x4aicCUNaqhQ_UrofKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

While it would be sensible to use less or no Fossil Fuel, the narrative is generally that all combustion engines entirely should be banned, which is not at all about climate change and entirely about shifting wealth and economics. \n\n\nIf we pay attention to how the climate cycle works, how we're using land and what we're getting out of it, there's a lot of land that could be used to grow fuel crops, this cycles carbon more responsibly. In terms of economics it would also allow for domestic fuel production creating domestic jobs and bolstering national economic strength. \n\n\nThe idea that all combustion engines and high density fuels should simply be replaced with batteries is an unsustainable, ill thought out plan that didn't come about through science and was instead created by climate fear mongering. Imagine a world where only people living in developed cities are able to drive as most rural locations don't and won't have infrastructure capable of supporting electric cars, not to mention many people can't even park near their own homes. \n\n\nImagine a world where only the wealthy city dwellers are able to work jobs away from home and the people who live the furthest away from anything will just what.. dwindle and die out? \n\n\nSounds like a horrible world.\n\n\nNow imagine a world where the rural residents grow food and fuel for the whole country, while city folk have their electric cars and their public transport and rural folk have their long range high density combustion fuels so they can travel where they need to go to make their business happen.

As you probably know, deep ice cores at the French Dome C and Russian Vostok Antarctic stations span an 800,000 year  time period. They cover eight glacial advance/retreat cycles of about 100,000 years each. Those advance/retreat cycles have been linked to the Milankovitch cycles of Earth orbital excentricity, precession, and axial tilt. During that time, average ice \"air\" bubble CO2 content ranged from about 180ppm during glacial advances and 280ppm during glacial retreats. At no time did the CO2 content  of the \"air\" bubbles exceed 300ppm. The current CO2 content of those bubbles exceeds 414ppm+ and is both rising and accelerating.  \n                     Meanwhile,  according to Peter Wadhams,  2017, A Farewell to Ice; a Report from the Arctic, p. 177, who has made some 50 expeditions to the Arctic to measure sea ice aerial extent and thickness, mainly in nuclear submarines,  September Arctic sea ice VOLUME has dropped from about 16 X 10(3rd) Km3 in 1976 to about  5 X 10(3rd) km3 in 2017. \n                    It is worth noting that Pres. Putin is expanding Russia¬¥s nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet and reopening old Soviet naval bases along the Siberian coast.  (The USA has NO nuclear-powered icebreakers.) An open Arctic sea lane will give Russia access to both Siberian petroleum and mineral resources as well as quicker access to the North Pacific for Russia's navy. I rather doubt that Pres. Putin is a fool.       old geologist", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Brooks Anderson", "channel": "UCRg-VhuaYVCpoe7nrB-xrGw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRFQ85m5zVu3yXuZZe6sr7SgBA1332qYvAZgg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It may be the case that H2O in the atmosphere may be as important as CO2 for warming. CO2 levels have mostly decreased for the last 175 My, (Rothman, 2002). I suggest the subject is still in a state of flux possibly because the cycles are of such immense duration and variability.

Reducing Carbon Dioxide emissions may make the average scientifically illiterate green supporter feel better about themselves but as for preventing small rises in the mean global temperature totally inifectual and pointless. One might as well stop breathing.  Irrespective of what some scientists say the planet stopped warming in 1998 and the growing season has shortend by two weeks since then. Remember Carbon Dioxide plus hydrogen is used by plants to manufacture sugars and starch. The hydrogren is split from water by photosynthesis. The increased Carbon Dioxide levels have enabled plants to further green the planet. Increased Carbon dioxide levels have enabled plants to reduce the number of pores on the underside of their leaves. These pores leak water vapor. So fewer pores mean the plants can make better use of the available water hence the greening of the planet", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Donald Boughton", "channel": "UCM1Dgfoe1gK0D-JcBftiFUg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRm1xHNPeQ4hIDo2dzYF9pf0C6kQg0Cb5Cp0g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
