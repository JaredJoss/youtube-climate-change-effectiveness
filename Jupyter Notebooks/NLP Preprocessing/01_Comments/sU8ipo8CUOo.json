It's a global problem which needs global solutions, and agreements need to be reached to prevent companies from 'exporting' their emissions to less-regulated countries. In this video, doctors from India, Australia, and Britain are featured for their efforts to reduce environmental pollution and emissions in their countries from health care, an industry which is difficult to transfer abroad. \n\nIn terms of the United States, it's a mixed picture. It receives special attention both for its role in global leadership and because it has emitted far more than any other country: https://ourworldindata.org/contributed-most-global-co2 . On the other hand, it has pioneered leading environmental reforms like eliminating lead from gasoline and CFCs that destroyed the ozone layer that have helped reduce pollution at home and around the world. Many countries around the world now have environmental restrictions, though enforcing them can be a key challenge.
