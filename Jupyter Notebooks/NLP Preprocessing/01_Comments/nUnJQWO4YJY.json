It sounds more like an Omega-3 deficiency, which has nothing to do with being vegan. Brain fog is a common symptom of an Omega-3 deficiency. Omega-3's are essential fatty acids that help support brain function. Non vegans rely on sea animals to get their source of Omega-3's. However, Omega-3's are not produced by animals. They are produced by algae, which is how the sea animals get their essential fatty acids. Some people think that eating things like chia seeds and walnuts is enough to get Omega-3's but that's not true. Those plant sources only contain ALA. ALA can convert into the other two fatty acids DHA and EPA, however that's assuming one gets enough ALA and that you are not consuming too much Omega-6. Because this ALA conversion is unreliable, it is important for a vegan to take an algae based Omega-3 supplement unless they are living in Asia and are consuming sea vegetables on a daily basis. People on a vegan diet who are experiencing brain fog really need to start paying attention to their Omega-3 intake.

So, giving up meat won't make much of a dent, if any difference at all, in global temps. What is the real cause of this post-1980 rise in global temperatures? A major cause is the ever-increasing electricity demand from computer industry, which was beginning to take over our economy in 1980, just when the temps began to rise from increased CO2 from coal-burning power plants. The computer industry's insatiable appetite for electricity, which is projected to rise uncontrollably, as the industry automates the entire world, has also spawned fracking, which is the real cause of the recent spike in methane (not cattle!). Also, the destruction of the rain forest needs to be focused on, and Brazil has plowed up its rangeland to grow harmful sugar, so the rain forest is destroyed to create rangeland for their cattle. So, instead of giving up a very nourishing and essential (for many nutrients) food like meat, give up non-nourishing, indigestible, harmful, and rain forest-destroying crops, like sugar cane, chocolate, coffee, tea, wheat made into refined flour, soybeans, corn (corn oil and high fructose corn syrup), canola, sugar beets, palm oil, cotton grown for very unhealthy oil, crops grown for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and tobacco. Then, a huge amount of land would be freed up to pasture animals, so we can become healthy again, and to finally regenerate soil that has been destroyed by cultivation, which will enable carbon storage in the soil, the best strategy to deal with CO2 in the atmosphere. Also, let's put a hefty environmental tax on the computer industry's use of electricity, so they can finally pay for the environmental devastation that they have played a large role in, which will fund the renewable energy industry that computers require.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joan Tendler", "channel": "UC7ZybReflS0x64KbBqqH-Bg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSEzey8ICusZG2a0FbqBDCH2o6Id3gEh1H0ox8f=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I wouldn't be surprised to find that a lot of people are just as unfamiliar with that as they are a vegan or plant-based diet. For personal health, I'd say the Mediterranean diet is probably the best and most studied but having tried at various points throughout my life to eat that way, I can also say it's not that easy. It requires cooking almost all your food yourself, as well as planning your oily fish intake carefully to meet Omega needs while making sure you're sourcing fish responsibly and with the right levels of Omegas. The people who eat a traditional Mediterranian diet, come from family and community units that are vastly different from the majority of the US for example. Small farming communities where women are responsible for cooking and meal planning, making sure that everyone is well-fed and keeping food waste to a minimum. It may seem like the less controversial suggestion but in practice, it feels a lot more like saying \"don't worry too much, just have a go, we know you probably won't do it anyway\". That's not really good enough when we've also been told that eating vegan is the thing we can do that has the single biggest impact on climate. It's also increasingly compatible with the lives of more people living in urban environments who work long hours. There is, of course, planning involved but based on my own experience as someone who lives in a major city, a lot less planning than the Mediterranean diet.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Edie Lee", "channel": "UCu3ytoWwvOm3oc1Dhd_8Biw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTTjP7Xaw9iHNBg_FA421B-vGrXP17OzAF3Ze_m=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Depending on where you are and where your food is coming from, particularly your meat can restrict your diet. If you come from a low-income household, and cannot fund a vegetarian, or even Mediterranean lifestyle, that's important to take into account. Fast food restaurants make meat easy, cheap, and filling, perfect for low-income people. If you medically need some of the nutrients found most commonly in meat, such as if your body doesn't process magnesium correctly, so you have to have more than the average person just to actually receive what you actually need, then meat is a great option, especially in places like the USA where healthcare is often too expensive to be a realistic method.

There are quite a few people who simply cannot absorb nutrients (such as iron and B12) well enough from supplements or plant based alternatives & I was one of them. I wound up anemic and dangerously fatigued. I‚Äôm happy that this video isn‚Äôt simply telling people to go vegan, like some of the comments are. I wish so badly I could be vegan, but for my body it‚Äôs simply not possible and I think a lot of the vegan community tends to see that as an excuse or not trying hard enough when it‚Äôs not.

I started doing this several months ago and it was so easy to do, saves money, and is often healthier. Bring your own containers and buy in bulk. You'll begin to realize how much of what we eat comes coated in plastic (ice cream, Goldfish, dairy and non-dairy milks). This helps avoid packaging and materials that cannot be recycled (which produce a lot of emissions just to be made and more when they are incinerated). Seems too intimidating? Try one simple switch at a time. Stop buying packaged milk and buy oats in bulk to make super cheap and easy oat milk at home. Craving something sweet? Nix the packaged cookies and bring your own container to the bulk section to fill up on chocolate almonds. If we all did one switch as small as this the planet will notice.

You'll notice that almost all the studies cited only look at emissions but fail to mention the net addition of carbon gases to the atmosphere. The source of the carbon matters. Second, did the video mention a study but fail to provide a citation/link anywhere? \n\nThere are many, many reasons for us all to eat less meat but just looking at emissions of global warming gases from livestock and equating those with emissions from fossil fuel burning -- as Ben Houlton does here -- is not a reasonable thing to do.

People make decisions based on what's available, they don't always act in perfectly rational ways, and when averaged across all humans, the trend in human behavior is always toward ease and comfort. The vast majority of climate change can be traced back to the supply side: corporations that produce that meat, use carbon-intensive manufacturing processes, and continue to expand fossil fuel extraction over clean energy sources. Even if I and every person I've ever met stopped driving entirely, gave up on meat, and installed solar panels on our homes, it would make basically no difference on the world's carbon emissions. Even if I quit my job to become a transient, wandering around and convincing every new person I met to do the same, I'd probably max out at around 100,000 people. If all of those people also started living the life of an ascetic monk, it still would make very little difference when compared to the 7 billion humans, and it would take me another 5 decades to do.

But cows, sheep and other ruminant animals can break cellulose down and release the solar energy contained in this vast resource. According to the FAO, as much as 70 percent of all agricultural land globally is range land that can only be utilized as grazing land for ruminant livestock.‚Äù\n\nFossil fuels are feeding the world.\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/10-calories-in-1-calorie-out-the-energy-we-spend-on-food/\n\nVegans attack: A carnivore replies! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tv6kFH-WwgA\n\nMost Vegetarians Return to Eating Meat due to Failing Health\nby Sarah Updated: May 24, 2018 \n\nhttps://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/most-vegetarians-return-to-eating-meat/\n\nIf you want to save the world, veganism isn‚Äôt the answer\nBy Isabella Tree‚ÄîGuardian \n\nhttps://bit.ly/2D1AJSc\n\n‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs a huge responsibility here: unless you‚Äôre sourcing your vegan products specifically from organic, ‚Äúno-dig‚Äù systems, you are actively participating in the destruction of soil biota, promoting a system that deprives other species, including small mammals, birds and reptiles, of the conditions for life, and significantly contributing to climate change.‚Äù\n\nHealth Dangers of a Plant-Based Diet\nAugust 9, 2018\n\n https://www.kevinstock.io/health/health-dangers-of-a-plant-based-diet/\n\nDebunking of :Dr Michael Greger is a strident vegan.

Before that I saw game changers which interested me in at least reducing meat intake for both my health and the environment but after seeing Dominion (well the first 40 minutes couldn't get past that tbh) the only meat I'll eat is either meat a friend hunted themselves or fish I fished, and even then it's probably only gonna be if I need the protein boost and fall on hard times where I can't keep affording plant based meat replacements like tofu tempeh and chickpea flour where I wouldn't afford store bought meat either anyway.\n\nWith all that being said I have to agree that it's better to encourage people to reduce meat intake by having meals at least once or twice a week incorporating a meat replacement and a dairy replacement as well if they're a milk drinker, while also educating them with facts about the environmental and ethical issues with the animal agriculture industry, leaning heavily into the environmental concerns as well as health concerns though careful not to blow the latter out of proportion or else you might lose credibility with them, namely because well lets be honest most people are painfully and disturbingly selfish. Show them how it might effect them or their children in the future and they will care much than they will about suffering kept out of sight and out of mind behind the factories walls. And it's also quite possibly a gateway into them becoming more and more willing to embrace at least a mostly plant based diet and lifestyle. As I try more meat free meals I find it harder and harder to justify eating meat ever where before I started I figured I'd have no trouble getting a steak with friends if we went to a steakhouse.

Depending on what part of the plant you have, commonly you need to add different hormones/\"plant growth regulators\" as well, such as starting in GA3 to stimulate a dormant embryo to begin growing, then transferring into the same medium but with \"BAP\" to cause the cell mass to develop leaves, then transfer into the same medium but with \"NAA\" to cause the cell mass with leaves to develop roots, at all stages in the culture, the plant will grow just fine without leaves or roots, as all it's nutrients are coming directly from the medium it's growing in, being absorbed through the cell walls.\n\nWhen it comes to animal based tissue culture, things get much harder, because plants have the ability to fully clone themselves, while animals don't & require extensive scientific knowledge & skills to clone, but the basics are still the same, add sugar & the animal's equivalent of that hydroponic fertiliser, then add an extra catalyst to trigger reproduction of the nondescript cells (stem cells), then trigger them to form the type of cell that you want, in this case muscle. They can actually get part of this process without fetal serums (forgotten which part now) & they use that in PR claims to state that they have achieved it without fetal serums & are \"just refining the growth process\" but they can't actually grow from scratch to muscle fibres in a lab without using the fetal serum. All have significantly reduced the amount of serum they need (started out at 50 litres per burger pattie) but all have reached the same point & got stuck. They mostly use cow fetal serum because it's the most available, but they can substitute it for the blood of any unborn animals for any meat growth. The most promising lead on removing the unborn animal blood appears to be using human waste product blood, with enough of it, it's possible they may even be able to use adult blood in the place of the fetal serums, potentially buying all blood products that have passed their shelf life & need to be disposed of & using those in the lab meat, after further refining. They may even be able to harvest the blood of dead humans & refine it to obtain small amounts of the components they need to grow the meat. They could do that with animals too, but that defeats the purpose of the lab meat, hence why some are looking to human waste blood to sell their product as \"ethical\". They all talk about making a plant based formula, but there's just no evidence they're getting anywhere on that. So yeh, the can make it, no question about that, but they need to use both stem cells and large amounts of unborn baby animal blood to do so", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgwCId4nEpKEKFlT_z14AaABAg.8q9ZYx5qJRT8qIYAy1GA5G", "text": "‚Äã¬†@Knowledge Is Key¬† \"also what do you mean by inefficient. Environmentally, the amount of work that goes into it, what? \" So the reality is that a rumen is very efficient. It can process 80kgs or so of grass or other cellulose material per day, fermenting it all & extracting from it the amino acids required for around 1kg of meat production. The rumen also comes with it's own transport system, generally referred to as legs ;) This is what typical ranches can look like https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cattle+station&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA3tPOkMfaAhXDGpQKHVZgBRAQ_AUICigB#imgrc=mGGS9nGHV4stmM: in that setting, they release those rumens on legs & let them find their own food & 12 months later, use planes to round them up again & muster them back to the station, where trucks are waiting to collect the mature ones & transport them to slaughter. They ensure that that land is scattered with small windmills & drinking water troughs so the cows can access drinking water once every 5-10kms in any direction they go, with enough water for a small number of animals to drink from. Those water points end up doubling as water sources for local wildlife too & so actually enhance the natural eco-systems rather than negatively impacting them. Other than that & the medical checks carried out each year, there's no additional work involved in producing meat based food that way, so it's dam hard for lab meat to compete with that efficiency. Each cow in that environment will need around 20 hectares of land to feed them. Lab meat needs to access the same quantities of amino acids as the cows do for growth, so while the lab meat will only need 1kg of inputs for 1kg of outputs, someone or some system is going to have to go through that 80kgs of grass & extract just the 1kg of amino acids from it to feed into the lab set up, so that's a lot of work we're now trying to do instead of letting cow rumens do for us.\n\nIn reality, that type of land wouldn't be used, much higher quality cropland would be used instead & crops like soybeans planted with mechanical equipment, harvested & processed to extract the amino acids to feed into the lab meat, so that means clearing forest land to obtain the land with enough rain to grow soybeans, using the fossil fuels to grow them & then using more energy to extract the amino acids after harvest. Those crops also need fertilising, that can be done with chemical fertilisers, or the waste from the soybeans can be somehow processed to return the nutrients from them back into the soil, currently that is done by feeding crop waste to animals, who again use their rumen to ferment it all & poop it back out in ready to use form for the plants within a day or 2. Livestock currently do this with 6 billion tonnes of dry matter per year, of which only 14% is edible to us, 46% is grass & 32% is crop waste http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/photo/2017_Infografica_6billion.jpg so we also need to find a way to deal with that waste if we don't feed it to livestock for conversion to fertiliser. In the days before people worked out how to make cotton seed edible to cows, the way that waste was disposed of was to pile it up in fields & burn it, that's the only realistic option that would be available again if we stopped feeding it to livestock & regardless of if that organic matter is broken down in a rumen, in a lab system, in landfill or via burning, it always gives off the same methane & CO2, so we don't even reduce cow burping emissions by removing them from the equation.\n\nSo all in all, it sounds good, but in reality, nature actually has highly refined & efficient systems already in place in the form of animal rumens & we just can't realisticly compete with using them properly ie having them process only waste & grass, if we have them process grains we could eat, then that's inefficient, but used properly, it's far more efficient than we can achieve artificially. The only way we can really improve efficiency beyond that is with insects that don't waste energy on generating heat, therefore directing all amino acids in the grass & crop waste directly into meat production. The most efficient way of creating the lab meat would probably to have insects eat the waste & then processing the insects to extract the amino acids from them, so obviously it's therefore easier & more efficient just to directly eat the insects.\n\nI've got sources on lots of the stuff I argue with vegans, but on the lab meat I haven't really saved any, because it's always changing (while still saying the same, just a year & name update) & because it comes up so easily on google. Most of the rest of what I've said is a mix of stuff I've got from lots of websites & combined, but if there's a specific element I've said that you want a source on, let me know & I might have one here for that :)\n\n\"side note: i always like it when people agree with people on youtube ü§£üëå\" me too :) although I also enjoy a good debate, just as long as there's facts involved rather than the vegan ranting of propaganda & denial of anything that doesn't fit with what they want the truth to be.

Roos travel up to 100kms a day, can just wait for them to come into areas near the processing plant & shoot them before they eat the crops being grown for humans, with them having eaten desert grasses their whole life to grow. Intestines etc are left for scavengers, blood to feed the soil, so as to keep the eco-system intact, desired parts of the carcass are simply loaded onto a specially designed rack on the back of a ute & driven to a nearby processing centre, where carcass is checked for parasites & diseases & body temperature, then skinned, then moved into a cleanroom for cutting & packing. large slabs can be cryopacked & then refrigerated & will stay fresh for 3-6 months. When a large enough load is collected, then a refrigerated shipping container full of high calorie, high protein meat can be put on a slow cargo ship to reach it's destination in a month or so's time, where it's unloaded & sent to stores. At this point it still has a refrigerated life span of months or a frozen lifespan of a year or more. Total resources used in it's production & transport were 1 bullet, 5-10 seconds of power for a spotlight, fuel to transport to the processing centre, fuel for refrigeration form that point on & fuel for a slow moving cargo ship. That's very little! Statisticly 80% of that meat will be eaten too, whereas only 55% of fruit & vegetables will be eaten after their transport.\n\nBeef, lamb etc have a similar production cost, but are usually transported longer distances from their farms to slaughterhouses, this is done live, so no refrigeration costs, but less efficiency in terms of transporting whole animals, so only about 15-20 tonnes of actual meat per road train, but after slaughter it will be 60 tonnes of cryopacked high calorie, high protein meat per shipping container, just like the kangaroo.\n\nAvocados by comparison must be picked by hand, one by one, so far less efficient than meat, reach processing destination & be cooled within the same time period as kangaroo, be sprayed to prevent stem rot, be sprayed with various pesticides, depending on destination country, be washed or brushed to remove bugs & dirt, be sorted by size so they fit into packing trays correctly, have imperfect fruits found & removed & disposed of, be packed into single level trays with extensive packing materials to protect them from damage from others in the batch pressing onto them, be transported in refrigerated shipping containers, but unlike the meat, most of he shipping container is filled with packing materials & air gaps in order to protect the fruit (and half the fruit is seed that will be thrown away too, while the bones of the meat were cut out before transport) & unlike the meat with months of shelf life, the avocados have only a few weeks before they will rot, so no slow ship travelling around the world via the most efficient route, their ship must travel directly to the sales destination & packaging must be designed to only transport the immediately required supplies to the destination country & another ship must leave directly for that country 1-2 weeks later & repeat year round. There is also the risk that one or more fruits may begin ripening on route, due to an extra fruit being thrown in the batch from the ground or similar & if this happens, it will cause unexpected early ripening of the entire shipping container & cause them all to be disposed of unsold\n\nAll in all, if meat is being shipped because there is a better growing zone on the other side of the world, it can be an efficient use of resources, but fruit & veg are extremely highly demanding & inefficient transport items with huge waste levels due to such high levels of perishability & lack of adaptability to alternative storage methods such as freezing, canning, drying, smoking etc (some fruit & veg can be treated in some of those ways, but today's vegans are generally picky & demand their food fresh & refuse to eat anything processed to extend shelf life & increase efficiency of production, making them very high resource consumers!)", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Scientists at Australia's government science organisation (the CSIRO) tried to experiment to replicate that in cows & failed, however in the process they found & patented a seaweed that reduced methane by an average of 98-99% when fed to cows as 1% of their diet & they scientificly proved it to reduce methane by a minimum of 80%. \nNow that being said, it's a gimmick. There's no correlation, let alone causation between ruminant numbers & atmospheric methane. There's been numerous tests in history, the North American bison kill off & rinderpest virus outbreaks in Africa, killing 10% of all ruminants (wild and domestic) fail to register on ice core samples as even a glitch & there are less ruminants on the planet now than at any time in human history. Methane is a natural bi-product of organic matter breakdown, the same microbes live both in ruminant guts & in landfill & soil. If cows don't eat the grasses etc, they still give off the same methane as they breakdown, this is why landfill methane levels are so high.\n\nThe only methane that genuinely matters is the methane that's been out of the system for millions of years - the stuff from natural gas. There IS a direct correlation between natural gas getting into the atmosphere & atmospheric methane levels. Here's a bias discussion about that, but it's from a reputable soil scientist & I've failed to debunk anything she says, obviously the audience this is written for make it very bias though, but it's still interesting http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF/JONES-CarbonFriendlyBeef(27April10).pdf", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You've been conned. \nTrees grow on land with significant water & low weather extremes. This land is always the most productive. \nSemi-arid/desert land simply cannot support trees, all trees are C3 photosynthesisers & C3 photosynthesis stops when temperatures rise over around 30c & therefore the plant cannot make the energy it needs to survive. \n\nAt 30c, 2 plants that are otherwise the same but one C3 & one C4, the C3 will lose approximately 833 molecules of water per CO2 molecule fixed, while the C4 will lose only 277 molecules of water per CO2 molecule fixed, making C4 plants the ONLY plants that can survive in semi-desert & desert conditions.\n\nC4 plants are grasses. This is why semi-arid areas are always natural grasslands. C4 plants make up 5% of the planet's bio-mass, but are responsible for 23% of it's carbon sequestration. You're barking up the wrong tree if you think trees are the solution to climate change. Grazing ruminants provide C4 grasses with the fertiliser & pruning & seed distribution then need to be healthy (C4 plants require far more sun & fertiliser than C3's). Healthy grasslands sequester 100 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year. This is well beyond any forest landscape, beaten only by peat swamps\n\n& the highest food per acre is from rice fields simultaneously growing fish for consumption (that's also one of the highest carbon emitting farm system though) Trees are not even in contention as highest yielding crop per acre per year! I don't even know which tree you think would yield even reasonable crop quantities!\n\n& 75 billion tonnes of carbon rich soil is lost each year in the production of just 3.5 billion tonnes of crops. That's 10 tonnes of soil lost every year for every man, woman & child on the planet! That has a HUGE impact on increasing climate change! Properly managed ruminant grazing reverses this & catches that erosion from crop growing & puts that carbon back into the soil to bring atmospheric carbon levels back down\n\n& btw the vast majority of those animals you speak of are 36 day old chickens.

Dave3¬† actaully if the cows are put onto the land of the same quality that is needed to produce that vegan food in that space, then 1 hectare of that land is generally accepted as supporting 8 adult & baby cow pairs (16 cows, equal to 12 adult cows). When intensive managed rotational grazing is used instead of cropping & harvesting, due ot the loss of teh need for drying time of the grain & reduction in grain loss to the ground during harvest, this can easily be increased to 18 growing cows per hectare, using accepted eating quantities & crop production quantities, with cows slaughtered at 12 months of age on average, that totals 30 million calories per hectare. An average person eats a little under 1 million calories per year, so food for 30 people per hectare. Seperate space is not required for animals like chickens though, 3 days after the cows have self-harvested that crop, a trailer full of chickens & their nests can be towed in overnight while they sleep & then opened the next morning to let them eat all the maggots that have grown in the cow manure. This creates an additional 15 million calories per hectare per year in the form of eggs, so that's 45 million calories per hectare per year, or 45 people fed per hectare per year. \nRice is the highest yielding crop, with 2 crops of 6 tonnes average each, giving 43.8 million calories per year, so that's just under the cow/chicken combo. If fish are added, it can be increased to beat the cow/chicken combo (geese can be added there too btw) & sugarcane can also beat the cow/chicken combo, but no other crops can. Corn could come close IF it wasn't dependent on shortening days to mature, but since it is, it's limited to only 1 crop per year.\n\nYou are comparing cows raised on land they are usually raised on, that looks like this https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cattle+station&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA3tPOkMfaAhXDGpQKHVZgBRAQ_AUICigB#imgrc=mGGS9nGHV4stmM: with crops grown on prime cropland, that is not a rational comparison. You are also not factoring in which foods vegans actually eat, you are calculating ONLY based on rice & ignoring the amount of low calorie foods that the majority of vegans eat as the primary part of their diet.\n\nIt very much shows that you have never grown any of your own food in your life!

We also have several other factors which show that we are meant to eat meat, for example, the adicity of our stomach. Our stomach acid has a pH of around 1.5, so rather low, meaning that we have a diet high in bacteria. Scavengers have a pH of 1.3, so similar to humans, but herbivores have a pH of around 4.1-6.1 (depending on whether they are a foregut or hindgut herbivore) showing that in fact, our diet naturally contains meat.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "jeon soyeon", "channel": "UCJf-U-oXHFOQUeF3EwMuoSA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTU_IzLIC5biNuv9DV4Mmvb4mGPn1rJnQaaU7lq=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If that's not the case then why did other animals not evolve in the same way we did? Search it up, there is a lot of research. A lot of what you say is not properly backed its rather funny. Again, the foods that cause cancer are processed or contain many harmful hormones injected in them in order to make them grow at a faster rate, and therefore death rates from such diseases have risen through the past years due to our increased consumption in processed foods. I'm not saying go out there and just eat meat, I'm saying that it is important to have a balanced diet and to realise that eating meat is only natural for humans and provides us with many benefits. If we really did evolve as herbivores, then vegans wouldn't have to take supplements would they, that just shows that the diet is unnatural.

They're foregut fermenters, and the process of methanogenesis in their rumen is what creates CH4 like with any other ruminant including bison, elk, sheep, impala, etc. Methanogens in the rumen produce CH4. So enteric methane is more \"burps\" than \"farts.\"  That enteric methane also has a context, so like with any source of CH4 emissions you have to look at the entire ecosystem not just GROSS emissions...You have to look at NET emissions instead.  Net emissions account for CH4 sinks as well. These sinks include geospehric sinks like methanotrophic bacteria in the soil, and tropospheric sinks likehydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere.

Did you know that the World Wild Life Fund said that 52% of all wild vertebrates were killed between 1070 and 2012 and 58% were killed between 1070 and 2014, As Sailesh Roa PhD has calculated, at that same rate will have no more wild vertebrates by 2026. Not to panic, but taking t so lightly as to say just a little bit will do is not enough. People need to know the seriousness of the situation. Please see Dr .

It's also important to note the impact on humans and I don't mean the health of those eating meat or even those in developing countries who are most effected by climate change. Slaughter house workers (how are largely immigrants and poor people) have extremely high rates of mental health issues given the unnatural and damaging nature of their work- repeatedly slaughtering sentient animals over and over again. Communities where a new slaughter house is built see crime rates sky rocket- likely due to either mental health issues or harmful adaptation (i.e. shutting down your sensitivity or compassion in order to carry out your job). We should shut down all slaughter houses and if you want to eat meat you can kill the animal yourself. Obviously, I also think we should be limited to 1 meat meal a week at most.

In the short term, yes, there might be a few more cows that are left grazing but seeing how the demand for meat has decreased, farmers would not raise as many cows to reduce their losses. The farmers don't want to lose their money in raising so many cows only to have them not be eaten.

Even if my beans come in a plastic bag, I'm pretty sure their equivalent would be a plastic-packaged piece of meat which would absolutely have a higher carbon footprint per gram of protein provided. My view on this is that, yes, we need to change the way we think of food packaging and move toward a reusable system but that has very little to do with what diet you're following for the vast majority of people. From vegetables to chicken nuggets, most of our food comes in unnecessary packaging that will outlive us all.

The first one gives the numbers with respect to a questionnaire of food choices while the second one actually recorded the daily habits of the subjects for a period of 7 days. \n\n \"The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95 % confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO2e/day) were 7.19 (7.16, 7.22) for high meat-eaters (‚Äâ>‚Äâ=‚Äâ100 g/d), 5.63 (5.61, 5.65) for medium meat-eaters (50-99 g/d), 4.67 (4.65, 4.70) for low meat-eaters (‚Äâ<‚Äâ50 g/d), 3.91 (3.88, 3.94) for fish-eaters, 3.81 (3.79, 3.83) for vegetarians and 2.89 (2.83, 2.94) for vegans.\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4372775/\n\n\"The omnivorous choice generated worse carbon, water and ecological footprints than other diets. No differences were found for the environmental impacts of ovo-lacto-vegetarians and vegans, which also had diets more adherent to the Mediterranean pattern. A high inter-individual variability was observed through principal component analysis, showing that some vegetarians and vegans have higher environmental impacts than those of some omnivores.  Thus, regardless of the environmental benefits of plant-based diets, there is a need for thinking in terms of individual dietary habits.\" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06466-8", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Devika Benoy", "channel": "UCz1dOXuh2qsLlShx6olV24g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTdHP0x9Q3AZnefaNzQJpR57ztJTIPy77PCh9EOGQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

On the other hand a pasture where that grass feed cow is being grazed can sequester carbon and use methane for plant growth even if those animals produce those elements at the same the same time.  Please don't simplify this equation too much!   Nature has been managing itself for billions of years before we came along so don't think we can solve things by getting rid of meat, livestock just might be an essential part of the equation that fixes climate change.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Rodney Howland", "channel": "UCtuTKh8uJVBt1f-umlOzerw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSQKZO1aEd36GNZiJM_WTBIWEozmbvssESSjpg5_w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgworpDQ-lo9UB8aTgV4AaABAg", "text": "It‚Äôs true that livestock emit methane and nearly all aspects of agriculture have a carbon footprint; however, U.S. animal agriculture is much more efficient than in other parts of the world. In the U.S., livestock are responsible for 3.8 percent of GHG emissions while transportation accounts for 26.4 percent, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. In California, 5.4 percent of GHG emissions are attributed to livestock and 37 percent to transportation, according to the California Air Resources Board.While it is vital that scientists in UC ANR, and elsewhere, assist ranchers to continue diminishing the carbon hoofprint, it is also important to recognize that meat can serve as a high-quality protein source as part of a nutritious diet. The VOX video does note that not all livestock is raised equally, and that rangeland can be used to sequester carbon, but it neglects to mention that grazing cows also provide numerous ecosystem services, such as eating plants that could fuel wildfires.It should also be noted how livestock fit into the larger food system picture. Almost 60 percent of the world's agricultural land is grazing land and is unsuitable for producing crops. Ruminants serve a valuable role in the food system by converting the forages humans cannot consume into a nutrient-dense food.UC ANR advisors and specialists continuously strive to improve livestock production practices; however, that is only one of many approaches we need to pursue to solve the challenges of climate change. Time, research and money should be invested where they will produce the most benefit for society. Encouraging people to focus on livestock, rather than on much larger sources of GHG emissions, can lead to policies that slow our efforts to develop more effective climate change solutions.\"", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Stephanie Holbrook", "channel": "UCKM3BLEjwjcQ4mQD6dZw6UA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQjl4qiW9SxPd5DG_oXB9l-hQanDIBm9P6OLlO9aKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I‚Äôm going to try to not come off as a crazy vegan who‚Äôs trying to make everyone vegan (I feel like people are entitled to their own decision despite what I morally feel) but all of what I‚Äôm about to say is backed by science. There is so much Co2 in the atmosphere that we can no long plant enough trees to save us. Animal farming is responsible for 60% of gas emissions for animal agriculture which is killing the planet. Besides that, our bodies are not made to consume meat: Heart disease, diabetes (yes diabetes can be from consumption of meat), cancer and other harmful diseases and fatal conditions can be reduced and come to an end if the consumption of meat is either reduced or illuminated. Another example is the evolution of human teeth. Our canines are very small and we no longer need or molars/wisdom‚Äôs due to us not consuming meat the way early humans did. Overall, humans have been consuming animal product for an extremely long time and there‚Äôs no excuse for people who say that there are no options in the vegan lifestyle. From this, humans could not simply just stop all together due to that not being realistic; we would have to  gradually reduce the intake of meat/ animal products but for the people that would be more into just trying it out for a day, go for it. There‚Äôs even a thing called the Seven Day Vegan Challenge which is great because you can see what works for you and you don‚Äôt have to commit to it unles you feel like this lifestyle is for you.(if you do try this please don‚Äôt snackand just not eat. Once again there are PLENTY of options out there.

They're foregut fermenters, and the process of methanogenesis in their rumen is what creates CH4 like with any other ruminant including bison, elk, sheep, impala, etc. Methanogens in the rumen produce CH4. So enteric methane is more \"burps\" than \"farts.\"  That enteric methane also has a context, so like with any source of CH4 emissions you have to look at the entire ecosystem not just GROSS emissions...You have to look at NET emissions instead.  Net emissions account for CH4 sinks as well. These sinks include geospehric sinks like methanotrophic bacteria in the soil, and tropospheric sinks likehydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. In fact, most CH4 is oxidized, and CH4 in general is short lived so it doesn't accumulate as much as CO2, this is why the whole notion of CO2 equivalency is being re-evaluated - Read:  https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP\n\nI go into this all in a lot more detail here in this blog entry: \nRuminations: Methane math and context https://lachefnet.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/ruminations-methane-math-and-context\n\n###", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Regenetarianism", "channel": "UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQDWLiaJgZ6qX8B1-laqCIL581_yqnAXukNB_UIFQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw7jeCVRDFXSix5aVZ4AaABAg", "text": "This is a very important discussion to have, and the video makes some great recommendations‚Äîit seems odd that people adopt an all-or-nothing attitude when it comes to meat consumption, especially since from a health perspective mostly veggies and occasional meat works very well. I also have heard, however, that the evidence that everyone switching to a no-meat diet would be best for the environment is not exactly foolproof. Animals graze and make use of land which we could never use directly for food (e.g., cows in certain pastures eat grass that I could never eat), and so their presence in the food ecosystem can help eliminate inefficiencies.

There's a coulpe of things I didn't like, and I'd like to clarify for those people who really want to be careful about their impact : first of all, \"mediterranean diet\" doesn't mean much, it doesn't have a strict definition ( trust me, I'm Italian, and I know we can do much better than today), so telling people \"start eating mediterranean\" might be misleading, it's not much different from saying \"reduce your beef consumption\", even though it sounds cool. \n\nMore importantly,  the video gives us the feeling that a certain food is always better than another ( fish better than meat, veggies better than fish).  However one must know that there's a huge difference between some different kind of fish, ( salmon, which is shown in the video, is actually one of the most CO2-intense, you'd better go for some small fish like makerel or harrings if you want to help the planet).\nAnd remember that the kind of food you eat is not the only thing that matters,  you have to consider where it comes from and how it was produced. For example, a mango is a fruit, but if it has to be shipped by plane to come to your table, it might be enviromentally worse than meat.\n\nHere's my video about the topic, you can also find nice references to scientific literature in the video description.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9xGPP2utr4", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Energy Sapiens", "channel": "UCCZdnarLDN5QTeRzagZxqVA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTJNPcHADMRyzSKn9DmZqIUwns8Rd-6NHb8KIjR=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They're foregut fermenters, and the process of methanogenesis in their rumen is what creates CH4 like with any other ruminant including bison, elk, sheep, impala, etc. Methanogens in the rumen produce CH4. So enteric methane is more \"burps\" than \"farts.\"  That enteric methane also has a context, so like with any source of CH4 emissions you have to look at the entire ecosystem not just GROSS emissions...You have to look at NET emissions instead.  Net emissions account for CH4 sinks as well. These sinks include geospehric sinks like methanotrophic bacteria in the soil, and tropospheric sinks likehydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. In fact, most CH4 is oxidized, and CH4 in general is short lived so it doesn't accumulate as much as CO2, this is why the whole notion of CO2 equivalency is being re-evaluated - Read: https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP\nI go into this all in a lot more detail here in this blog entry: \nRuminations: Methane math and context https://lachefnet.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/ruminations-methane-math-and-context\n\n###", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Regenetarianism", "channel": "UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQDWLiaJgZ6qX8B1-laqCIL581_yqnAXukNB_UIFQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Whole Foods in some places I heard partnered with them and tries to adhere to its guidelines but I don‚Äôt know how diligent they are about it- as consumers if we all put pressure on them and make calls or write in suggestions or feedback or complaints- they should get the message and respond. But individually that is a great mention- the Seafood Watch is a helpful tool to let you know what‚Äôs better or worse. There‚Äôs issues with farming but.... it can also be done better or worse so I guess I support best practices in farmed fisheries.... personally I generally stick to Salmon either wild or farmed.... I tend to stay away from Tuna or Swordfish, or any other large predatory fishes or endangered animals- especially sharks!!! I favor Salmon, Oysters, and love Lobster and crab too. I‚Äôm really content to just stick with that and never really crave anything else. Although Uni fresh sea urchin is amazing, like an Ocean mousse, and eel is also really yummy, so I just tend to love the little guys on the foodchain :) and they tend to be more plentiful.... but a problem is bottom Trawling, and by-catch - so the method of fishing is important. Crabs here in California tend to be caught by smallish traps- near the cost where big boats can‚Äôt go. It‚Äôs very regulated. So I feel good about eating crab. Oysters are generally ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù or cultivated and tended to in their own natural cove environments.... I‚Äôm sure it has some impact but I‚Äôm not concerned about it being really harmful. Least of my worries. In fact, Hog Island Oyster Co was recently mentioned on NPR for being a canary in the coal mine- sounding the alarm that yes the oceans are becoming too acidic due to sinking carbon from the atmosphere for us- but shelled organisms are pretty much doomed .... the ocean will be too acidic for them to grow their shells- and they‚Äôll just die off and we will have no more Oysters- no more shellfish- which is also going to be a problem for the rest of the whole ocean ecosystem- no more plankton with their tiny exoskeletons.... that‚Äôs Whale Food.... that means the Whales will die. Hot Island Oyster Co is working on ways to save their own business of course - they have found that sea plants take carbon out of the ocean just like land plants take it out of the air. So they are planting more sea kelp and sea grass for their oysters, and THOSE oysters get to enjoy a little micro-biome or microclimate that is less acidic and allows them to live. So.... I will definitely still be eating my oysters and have to pay Hog Island a visit :) \n\nWho really wants to live in a world without Whales???? :( \n\nIt is definitely worth eating responsibly for. \n\nOur choices even the little ones DO matter and add up. \n\nRice & Beans, farm fresh eggs.... some seafood....

Farm raised fish are probably you best option for substantial food source. The biggest issue is water. But the feed can be plant base or if the fish out omnivorous they can eat algae/aquatic weeds that occur naturally plus fish feed. The fish themselves aren‚Äôt injected with hormones like chicken has been found to be. And as long as they are care for properly the risk of the fish having diseases are slim. Most seafood related illnesses are bc of undercook meat or in the case of oyster there caught out of season or just not frozen fast enough to kill the vibrio. My recommendation is that if you are buying fish check if it was farmed raised or not, if yes see where the farm is located. In my experience most Americans fish farms are under strict guidelines from how the fish is raised to how they harvest, packaged, and shipped out.

{"cid": "Ugwq72zf7XUIbkEWFPN4AaABAg", "text": "There are alot of vegans and vegetarians, but there are just too many ignorant, impudent, naive, and just down right inhumane people who take this ever so lightly or not at all. Not to mention the idiototic children you see on the comments of butchering videos that say \"Mm they're crying and suffering make my hamburgers even better\". As funny as they believe themselves to be, they'll never change. Even people who don't think twice about climate change or the suffering animals and live in their own little world. Where if nothing harms them now, how could they change their lives for the benefit of others? Humans are selfish creatures. I mean its not even about telling people anymore. Its just talking to a brick wall, but even a brick wall has a bigger IQ than that kid behind the screen poking fun at the suffering of other creatures. I do like to think positively about wanting to be vegan. I mean recently 400,000+ less animals were killed the past decade due to veganism. It just digusts me that people are so naive. So simple minded and one sided that they cant even change something that will never even benefit them. Addiction is that cause. Just look at white people. With their hunting and meaningless slaughter of animals. While deer isn't a big part of climate change, I'm talking about the people who do hunt. Its because they hunt that they don't care about any other animals besides their dog. They'll devour any cooked carcass in sight. Unaware of the tons of negatives there are to even consume meat. Meat, dairy products, GMOs, and artificial preservatives are all sources of cancer, obesity, and addiction. Of course there aren't enough people who even know that because the industries are purposely wanting you to get cancer one day. Population control. Also they want money of course. They couldnt care less about you. If that wasn't true then why do the biggest industries of meat consumption pretty shove their advertising down everyones throat? Do you see vegetable and vegan meals advertised? Of course not. Anyways, in my opinion, this world is done for as it is. I mean, look who's president for god's sake. No one will change and no one will care, but every person who does is obviously helping tremendously already. They're not selfish unlike a majority of our species. If you're offended by this, take it up with someone who cares. If not, spread the word. Help the world. Help all sentient beings that we share this earth with. If not for them, for the people you love then. Climate change affects everyone. This is as real as the phone or computer in your face. So you decide. Decide fast because time waits for no man.

The association with processed meat was similar to that observed for total meat [M3: Œ≤ (95% CI) = 25 (15, 34), P < 0.0001]. The strongest association was shown for poultry [M3: Œ≤ (95% CI) = 45 (29, 62), P < 0.0001].\"\n\noh & there was another group that put on more weight with meat too \n\"In addition, the relation between red meat and weight gain was also stronger in physically active subjects compared with moderately inactive or inactive subjects\" who would have thunk! People who go to the gym & work out lots add more muscle when they eat more meat lol\n\nThis is interesting too \"Meat intake was not significantly associated with weight gain in all centers with a negative average of the prudent pattern score (except Denmark and Norway)\"\n\n\"The strongest relation with annual weight change was observed for poultry. However, when subjects with previous illness and those likely to misreport their energy intake at baseline were excluded from the analyses, the association of weight gain with poultry was attenuated and the strongest association was observed for processed meat. This suggests that this result may be driven mainly by subjects with previous illness or weight-loss attempts that lead to diet intervention, as well as those who misreported their dietary intakes.\n\nOur results appear to contradict experimental studies that provide evidence of short-term increases in satiety and thermogenesis and decreased energy intake with high-protein diets (54). It has also been shown that obese subjects on a low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet lost more weight after 3 mo than did those on a conventional diet (11). However, results were not confirmed after 1 y of follow-up (11, 55). Furthermore, most of the intervention studies specifically on meat intake (21‚Äì26) did not find any weight change difference when energy from carbohydrates was partially substituted with meat (23‚Äì26). These differences could be linked to differences in the food substitutions performed as well as differences in the population's initial dietary habits. With control of energy intake for 9 wk, postmenopausal women who ate a diet supplemented with chicken (n = 15) lost significantly more body mass than did those supplemented with shortbread cookies and sugar-coated chocolates rich in carbohydrate and fat (n = 14) (21). All the other studies that substituted meat with healthier food such as soy products and legumes (23, 26), bread, pasta and rice (24), or fish, eggs, and cheese (25) did not find any significant weight-loss difference between the 2 interventions. In our study, the association between meat consumption and weight gain was weaker in subjects with a low prudent pattern score. Furthermore, meat intake was not significantly associated with weight gain in all centers with a negative average of the prudent pattern score (except Denmark and Norway), which indicates that the association could be diluted in populations with high consumptions of other high-energy-dense foods.\"\n\n\nSo it appears that that study (with it's self reporting) confirms that eating lean unprocessed red meat as part of a healthy lifestyle, including reasonable exercise doesn't impact on weight in the majority of people, meanwhile those who switch from red meat to chicken are more likely to increase their weight, but all weight gains in the study were too low to be significant anyway. At least it's a reputably reported study - if you go to the actual study, that video is clearly a bunch of crap - given it doesn't even link to the study!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Dip your feet in the water of veganism/vegetarianism as slowly as you want but eventually you're gonna have to get in, the scale of meat the modern world is eating is far much more than is sustainable, and once more countries transition into an Americanized culture of eating \"extravagant\" meals with meat on every plate, a shortage will follow soon behind it. And that's assuming the world develops a more ethical means for raising livestock than the torturous life of factory farming like perhaps real free range farms. But the \"more ethical choice\" also uses more land. I could go on about the unethical life of dairy animals and how artificial insemination would not be tolerated for most other species but I see that your vegetarian so you must already be aware and just not care, that's not my business though", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "blase correa", "channel": "UCRASPK4nZIBagBNISOajkZA", "votes": "43", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSIuJlHhHKy388ZHfMjx2PlBaMR9NqN7_U6OEsgxw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Now we see the fires around the world and the fish and animals disappearing and gee, we have no idea how that happened? It was PEOPLE. Yes, maybe not us in particular but despite, it is what humankind has done and those who have tried to warn others are handed the task of trying to wake up those who don't want to be woken up, those who have never had a care in the world and think the world owes them tomorrow or those who have had a life of cleaning up after others.

Jesus is coming back and most of the worst parts of the book of Revelation are in the works or have happened.

Meat causing cancer has been debunked. Too much of anything is bad. At least most of time. There is a man who rather lost weight with meat centered diet. He claimed that problem with modern meat is livestock feed and factory farming. The problem is antibiotic and feeding corn. Also those studies showing link between meat and cancer are not showing full pictures. They generally have poor examples. How many of those people ate healthy whole food? It turns out that those Americans use processed junk food. That's the problem. Vegan can suffer from the same processed food, too. \nI respect vegan intention and goal. I agree that meat consumption, especially in developed countries like US needs to be reduced. Fortunately, people already started taking less meat last few years, but this year, meat consumption is expected to rise. I agree that there are many problems with modern animal agriculture, especially factory farming, but just painting every animal agriculture with the same bad practice is hasty generalization. Also, calling for the entire world to go vegan is naive and impractical. Actually, it's inefficient because not everyone thrives on vegan diet, not to mention many parts of the world can't support farming. (Science may be work around that. We will see.) People with longest life span rely on non vegan style. \nActually, supporting edible bug is better. You know why? Bugs can thrive on tons of food waste and effectively convert them to nutrition. Fruits and vegetables result in tons of food waste even before going to shelf. So why not use bugs like black soldier flies to get rid of them and convert them to protein? Or simply feed those maggots to chickens. It is proven that insect feed is very efficient for raising livestock. They take way less space, too.

In science my dear, time is crucial because we come up with new theories every day. \nAnyway, are you saying that having a cow or 2 in captivity is bad for the environment? What's the difference if there is a cow living on a piece of land that is surrounded by a little fence and a cow that lives on a piece of land in the wild? Or are you basically saying that we should cause deliberate cow extinction because their farts and land occupation are bad for the climate?", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "NH4 Ci", "channel": "UCok0G9Uur5m3vbc_Q--Zfiw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/5vA764I7tsZOwc3pcYmlz8VSirTkaVzd10LMpl0j_jGrC9Z5Zm6rCTkKtuvR8XtYTUCfRvZqJ-U=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Researchers name 2 forms of desertification, one by climate and the other by man-made forces. The one I'm talking about is the 2nd type. In ranges where rainfall remained consistent, large patches & areas of desertification appeared sporadically near areas that had stable grasses. What they found was that desertification appeared most around domesticated overgrazing. This can be observed the most in the Middle East where overgrazing existed for far more centuries. And we're following the same pattern in both North & South America. Cattle are not a native animal, they were imported & domesticated here. Like any new species introduced into an ecosystem, it drove out competitors like Buffalo & Bison which are now an endangered species. \n\nThe difference between water irrigation for rice and drought for rice and meat is huge. For almonds, the researchers at the University of California show almonds to require 23 gallons for an ounce of almonds compared to 106 gallons for an ounce of beef. Not to mention that lb for lb, nobody eats rice and almonds as much as they eat meat. That's hardly a fair comparison, especially considering that 1 lb of meat requires 2500 to 5,000 gallons of water (depending on your sources). \n\n\"Some\" of what I listed was transportation? Are you kidding, I listed transportation once. The rest were based on machinery, factory, production, and packaging. And even if avocados were to be transported, they're not on the same level of demand as animals. Bc we're not just transporting animals, but also the soy & grain we fly & boat in from the 3rd world lands to feed livestock. And yes, that grain you mentioned as a cause of deforestation, that grain is fed to livestock. \n\nAnd I never said that deforested lands were part of the food market trade. I said corporate land grabs of 3rd world countries were. Those corporate farms interfere with the land ownership & market competition of local farmers in 3rd world countries. Many of them go bankrupt, many workers are traded in exchange for machinery & go into poverty. \n\nBack to the drought dilemma, California alone sends 100 billion gallons of water in alfalfa to Asian countries where we import livestock. That's alot of water & fuel used to export out & export back in. Hardly an efficient way to produce food.

The ratio for lamb is between 4:1 and over 6:1 & that for beef starts at 5:1 and goes as high as 20:1. Meat is an inefficient source of calories, case closed. It accounts for 17% of global calorific intake, but uses twice that amount of land, water and feed. \n\nAnd here's the other part why:\nNot all of the cow makes it to the table. On avg, a 1,000 lb steer will only weigh 61% of its live weight once it makes it to the rail. This approximate 39% loss during the slaughter & dressing procedure\nis a result of the animal being bled & the hide, head, hooves, viscera, lung & heart being removed. The remaining 61% is referred to as \"Hanging Weight\" or the weight \"On the Rail\". But the loss doesn't stop there. Once the carcass is on the rail, it begins to leach moisture (shrink) which accounts for additional weight loss. This along with fat and bone removed during the cutting account for an 18% loss. In summary, a steer averaging 1,000 lbs on the hoof will avg around 430 lbs of retail cuts ( steaks, roasts, ground beef, stew beef, etc.) \n\nAgain, very wasteful and inefficient. I think I'll stick to my beans, veggies, and potatoes.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "YourMajesty143", "channel": "UCNV-z5HXmj4ZRtiDXmPsLyA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRIZY6ykcNQCOkd6OBxP1muK1XBM23u0FV8LQi6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The Loss (sorry, can't spell) plateau in China is the classic example of that & the vegans go to example of how it's possible to plant trees in \"deserts\". It's actually fertilie land, that they grazed & grew crops on in ridiculous ways & turned it to desert.\n\nCrops are the worst for desertifying, because they plow the land & then leave it bare waiting for rain, which leads to massive erosion & so then the rain can't get properly absorbed. The solution is to plant anything that will grow into that land to hold it together (normally perennial native grasses), however grass is a high nitrogen user, so if you don't get some fertilsier in there, then it will die off & again you get desertification. The best solution, therefore is to get the native grasses in, then once they're mature & have seed, send a big mob of animals in for a single day to prune them down to the ground & thoroughly fertilise, then move the animals off to a new area, carrying the seed with them & send the animals back once it's mature again. That's refered to as \"holistic grazing\" & is having HUGE success in reversing desertified areas of fertile & semi-arid land.

Fertilisers are generally government subsidised & cost next to nothing, so farmers use the \"more-on\" approach anytime something isn't growing properly & smother it with moron chemicals. There is also legislation in all developed world counties (where the vast majority of CAFO's are located that prohibit improper management of waste as a health hazard. It's pure bullshit to claim nitrogen runoff in the ocean is coming from animals not nitrogen applied as fertiliser!\n\npalm oil is used in a range of products, but most meat eaters know that animal based products blend best with human skin. It's vegans who want animal free alternatives & palm oil provides that. Vegans are also creating so much lobbying that even though their numbers are small, a disproportionate number of products are changing ingredients in order to be able to label themselves as \"vegan\", which is why there is so much demand for palm oil! Vegan are FAR more responsible for deforestation than meat eaters are! & as for rubber, maybe you can explain to me what your using to replace leather & sheepskin in your shoes & slippers if not rubber from those plantations?\n\n& lastly, if we look at irresponsible farming practices, we see crops are the worst in a huge range of ways, if we look at average farming of both, we see MASSIVE run off & wind errosion in crops, particularly in climate change situations, while we so NO runoff with livestock. If we look at best possible practice on both, we see that there is no way to avoid run off & erosion in a large variety of settings, other than perennial grasses - which are therefore only suitable for livestock farming & significantly reduce available agricultural land on the planet if not used as such (from 37% of the earth's surface to 10% of the earth's surface) & therefore we very rarely see best practice in crop farming in the world today! On the other hand, when we look at best practice livestock management, we see massive land regeneration & reversal of desertification & massive increases in soil carbon, leading to increased water retention, reduced run off & massive soild biliding - in fact the ONLY way to restore the 1/3rd of the world's croplands that have been destroyed by chemical fertilisers is by converting that land to pasture & using years of animals on the land to restore it (although again, when we switch to best practice, some farmers are acheiving restoration of land with NOTHING that will grow to full productive pasture within 12 months - still 5-10 years to flush the chemical fertiliser salts out & build up enough carbon to grow crops again without needing extensive chemical fertilsier, herbicides & pesticides though\n\nThere are more organisms in a single handful of healthy soil than there are humans who have ever lived on this planet! Chemical fertilsier kills them all! There can be near to zero in that 1/3rd of land I'm talking about as destroyed. Livestock in high enough concentrations can poop out enough organisms to repopulate & restore teh soil eco-system, so it can begin carbon sequencing again, but until those livestock are added, it will do nothing but loose soil & add to global warming as all that carbon leaves the ground & enters the air.\n\nEco-systems do NOT survive with chemicals replacing animals, like vegans want to see!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Those areas are too dry for the fungus etc that break down organic matter in rainforests, so ruminant animals doing it is the only option in nature. 37% of the planet's surface is currently in use for agriculture, but only 10% of that is capable of supporting any level of crop production, the rest can only support animals & is the type of land I just described, so I really don't think removing the animals would help, it would just lead to more grass fires. \n\nIf we could return natural grazing animals to the land, that might be different, but I can't see that happening & it wouldn't change the methane output anyway.\n\nShutting down factory farming is a different story!

It takes about 1/16th the land to grow plants to feed humans directly than it does to feed livestock which are then fed to humans. Not to mention the inefficient use of resources. Why filter my grains through a corpse when I can eat my nutrients directly at a fraction of the cost? Also, meat is incredibly resource-intensive. It's more than just methane & carbon emissions. Animal agriculture uses 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dumps massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets.

I haven't read the others yet, but I would trust the FAO over the others, since they're the ones really in the front line figuring out how to feed the entire global populaiton & that link states\n\n_\"Globally, there is enough cropland to feed 9 billion in 2050 if the 40 percent of all crops produced today for feeding animals were used directly for human consumption, while available grasslands were more efficiently used as the basis for livestock feed. Grassland-based and mixed crop-livestock systems optimize nutrient and energy cycles, while encouraging the use of rare livestock breeds that are adapted to \n lowinput and harsh environments. This is crucial in a context of climate change and increasing variability. \"_\n\nSo they're saying that we still need meat to feed that number of people, but we need to put animals where they belong - on land too dry to grow crops!\n\nJust another comment on an extra point it made, about currently 33% of croplands used for animals, that's not always what it seems! I live in Australia, the UN states that 1% of the continent of Australia is suitable for growing continuous crops. Around 8-10% of the continent can be used up to once a year in good seasons, if given periods of rest/stock grazing in between crops. It's normal however for much of that land to fail to produce for up to a decade due to droughts, providing only low intensity livestock grazing (often including the livestock being fed the crops intended for human consumption that have failed due to drought). \n\nAll that land would fall within that 33% they talk about as arable land, but it requires livestock on it in order to remain arable. In fact, 1/3rd of the planet's arable land has been lost in the last 40 years since chemical fertilisers were introduced, much of this could be salvaged with long term managed grazing to restore it, but more importantly, rotating grazing into land heading down this path, can rescue it before it's lost & maintain it's productivity long term.\n\nExtra point on this, 70% of Australia is used for farming of livestock - land that cannot be used for anything else, in fact people like the UN & other \"experts\" don't believe it's possible to get anywhere near 70% of the continent as agricultural land, saying 50% at most, due to more than that being termed as arid/desert land. The most sustainable agriculture in Australia is actually wild kangaroo harvesting (which is required for the health of the kangaroos & the land, since humans have been the only apex predator on the continent for 30,000 years & the entire eco-system would collapse if their roo culling was ended - was tested in 2002, after a few years of no culling due to animal welfare people successfully lobbying for it to end & 1/3rd of the roo population, 18million of them starved as a result, with countless other species also suffering & dying in mass numbers because of the roos eating everything as they died)", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Tassy tiger is in the marsupial lion family, it was hunted to extinction by white man within 100 years, but it's biggest prey was a possum & even that is debated as to if it could take one alive or only scavenge. It never took human sized roos. Aboriginals numbered up to 1 million when whites arrived & they farmed animals like roos and crops, but in such harmony with the land that whites didn't even realise the crops weren't natural (and didn't want to, spoilt their propaganda that the land was uninhabited).\n\nDingos do take a few, especially smaller wallabies, but they're not actually natives, they were introduced around 4,000 years ago. Impossible to say how the eco-system would function with them & not humans, since it's never happened, but mammals aren't natural here, only marsupials are, so it's likely not smart to try, especially since roos can live in the desert & dingos can't, so likely would end up a mess. Rewilding in Yellowstone etc is another story, since those predators were naturally there (and isn't that a success story! - which shouldn't really be surprising)\n\n& uneaten by human roo meat becomes pet food, but it's worth less, so shooters get paid less & are therefore of a lower skill level & make more mistakes. Assessments on human food culled roos show a really high levels of shooting accuracy & male only killing. Basically, the higher the value of the meat, the higher the animal welfare that goes with the kills. If the pet food market falls through, then the bodies are left to rot in paddocks & those ones are shot by amateur farmers, who often miss, often accidentally shoot mothers with young & while it's still better than some of the footage we get to see of their starving (maggots being laid under the skin of living animals & eating them alive once they're too weak to fend them off), the more we humans eat & the higher the meat value goes, the higher the shooter skill level & animal welfare checks (all shooters have tags that must be accounted for, human shooter tags are checked to ensure every kill was a clean, single shot to the brain)\n\nIt still kinda yucks me out to be eating \"skippy\", but it is the most ethical meat eating option & does improve their welfare. I'd rather eat them than watch the news footage we saw back in 2002 again!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\"This quote is not even including animal agriculture. The issue is greedy corporations and governments, as you say, not scarcity.\" that's the 40% of food we produce in the west & then dispose of, mostly because it wasn't up to \"cosmetic standards\" smh! INSANE! (plus the other stuff that report spoke of with using it for fuel etc)\n\n\"If people living in areas that can  eat vegan do so\" I'd prefer to see us use our influence to experiment with agriculture & learn more effective techniques that provide the highest possible level of animal welfare & then share these. There's no such thing as grain fed meat in Australia anymore, you have to special order it, due to a campaign to switch, for health & animal welfare reasons. That imo makes much more difference to overall animal welfare than a small percentage of people going vegan, since effectively all feedlots were shut down. \n\nThe more people demanding grass fed, the more pressure on those systems & the more chance farmers will switch to the holistic farming model that was in your first FAO link, which then sees huge land improvements & productivity improvements & can easily be implemented in third world countries with few resourses. The other thing is that a HUGE amount of Australia's income comes from meat sales internationally. Remove that & we would have only mining left to make money. Is it really more ethical to be selling uranium & coal when compared to animals? Because with all of those removed, Australia becomes third world! I'd rather accept that income BUT not accept it in it's full & without question! We ship animals overseas, where they then enter feedlots & suffer incredibly cruel treatment! The industry says it's essential & the country can't afford to loose that income, well I don't accept that! I'll accept the meat industry, but NOT substandard treatment of animals, with an out of sight, out of mind attitude! I don't believe there's any necessity to put any animal on a ship alive! It's cruel & there's alternatives, we just need to push for them!!!!!!!\n\ngtg for now, will read those links later & reply some more I'm sure. I can't believe your getting them from vegan sites!

{"cid": "UgwY3p3To32R5ZYg4s14AaABAg", "text": "Some simple tips to eating less meat once in a while:\n1. Replace beef in chili or tacos for beans, add extra garlic and/or onions for extra flavor. \n2. Do a veggie pot pie (use veggie broth and no meat), super easy to replace! \n3. Don't get bacon or sausage on your breakfast sandwich, an egg & cheese is still good! \n4. Restaurants usually don't have an issue with you swapping the meat in the dish for something else. ex) Instead of chicken on your Greek wrap, get falafel or artichokes or extra cheese (never pay more to swap for basic veggies! The meat is the most expensive part!) \n5. A lot of \"meat products\" (like \"beef\" burritos) use textured vegetable protein as a filler and it's really good on it's own! Soak it in water then crisp up in a sauce pan with spices, super easy! I do this a lot for chili, shepherd's pie, etc \n6. Some \"meat products\" actually aren't, like some beef burritos (said above) or bacon bits. Read the labels, you'd be surprised!\n7. I found ground beef to be the easiest meat to replace in recipes (except for burgers of course, you can't replace a good cheeseburger!) \n\nNo shame in eating meat, it's natural for humans.

Buying more beef to try and ‚Äúcull the numbers‚Äù just creates a bigger demand and more cows to be grown in the future. \n\nIt was grown to age and then slaughtered. It was flayed open, organs removed, and drained of blood. Then it‚Äôs off to a shop where it gets sectioned and cut. After that, ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù cuts are less than 1/4 of the total meat yielded.\n\nEvery steak you buy is the end result of a cow‚Äôs entire life, that includes everything it‚Äôs ever eaten, every plant it‚Äôs ever stepped on, and of course...all the times it has pooped, farted, or belched. THOSE are the emissions we care about.\n\nAll the wasted byproducts are extremely easy to measure in small quantities, but there is quite a lot of time passing and a lot of those byproducts are made. (READ: cows belch, fart, and poop a lot. They‚Äôre really inefficient at digesting, which is why they eat everything multiple times)\n\nSo, while there are ways that we can reduce the damage it does to the land to actually bring cows out to pasture. It‚Äôs probably not really much less methane emissions when compared to raising a cow in much more inhumane conditions.\n\nIf you ignore all of the talk about why we don‚Äôt like the downsides to our system of obtaining meat...there is still the problem of how much of it goes to waste. I can attest to cooking and throwing out the leftovers of much larger meals than I need to. Yet it feels easier to just buy more food than to eat ALL the leftovers myself.\n\nEDIT: To more directly answer your point, we should just eat meats in general LESS OFTEN. Don‚Äôt feel guilty about your steak unless it personally bothers you that an animal was specifically raised and slaughtered for your dinner to reach your plate.\n\nPeople around the world farm-raise livestock of all kinds for their meat. Cows, chicken, fish, pigs, sheep, and goats are just most of the examples.\n\nNobody can say that we should forsake our culture as humans without having to answer ‚Äúwhy is that something worth changing?‚Äù And that‚Äôs always something related to personal identity. \n\nLet‚Äôs all just enjoy that we have different opinions and try harder to be conscious about the impact we have on the world and people around us.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Devin Johns", "channel": "UCqr_GIgNiECgkBsHaK9dO0A", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQaJ6dlJgEcpMXuVYMcziEHffnWRz2wL-KMEA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Well in order to understand how CO2 is affecting the environment you first have to understand what a greenhouse gas is and how it warms up the atmosphere. Here is a link explaining what it is http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/climatechange/pages/greenhouse%20effect.aspx If you don‚Äôt want to read that link here is a decent explanation. \n\nBasically when solar radiation enters the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere it does so mostly in the form of visible light (The yellow light we see). When that enters the atmosphere and hits the surface of the Earth, it is absorbed. The earth then emits this same energy it absorbed in the form of infrared radiation back into the atmosphere. Without any greenhouse gases the IR radiation would just pass through the atmosphere and back into space. However, when greenhouse gases such as CO2 are in the atmosphere some of the heat is absorbed by the gas molecules and then sent back to the Earth‚Äôs surface. Some of this effect is a good thing as it keeps Earth warmer than freezing cold and keeps the temperature fairly even throughout the globe. However too much of the CO2 ¬†and you get too much warming and it has adverse effects. Currently that‚Äôs what is happening. We humans are pumping too much CO2 into the environment causing too much of the greenhouse effect and thereby warming the planet too much. \n\nIf you want to understand how the IR energy/radiation is absorbed by you need a bit of chemistry knowledge. Conceptually when a molecule absorbs IR radiation the bonds of the molecule to stretch or bend until eventually the IR radiation is re-emitted back towards the earth essentially trapping the IR radiation within the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse gas effect. Only certain molecules can absorb IR radiation. These molecules have dipoles (difference in charges between atoms) between bonds. This enables the stretching and bending of the intramolecular bonds.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Sasquatchan Bearhunter", "channel": "UC463eN99ys4YYkUcRir3Z6A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS22yHlomHxZa2vNRNOj0WUCmvNY5kGeGjIGiHl=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I am fully vegan now, but it took me years to finally get there. The final step of my journey was two-fold, that my father-in-law was dying of Alzheimer's disease and my husband had stage 4 Prostate cancer. My father-in-law is now dead and my husband's surgery got all the cancer but we are due for his one year check-up soon in November. Before that, my mother, sister and mother-in-law, all died of breast cancer. \n\nI had had terrible arthritis in my hands so I gave up all dairy. Whenever I cheated and had cheese on a pizza or ate ice cream, I'd regret it. I started buying veggie burgers for our dog as she was alleging to all grains because of genetically modified foods. Now I enjoy the veggie burgers. I feel more alert, not in a brain fog. I no longer need to take sleep medication to get a full night's sleep. I've lost 35 lbs. I still am losing weight but at age 65, the weight does not come off fast. But it is enough to bring down my cholesterol, never had high blood pressure and my blood sugar is now right where it should be.\n\nYou can learn to enjoy your food no matter what it is. Visit a Japanese steak house and order tofu, when it is prepared properly, it is delicious. Or go to an Indian restaurant and ask what are the vegan dishes. Eat those, you will be satisfied.\n\nNow I eat about 1/3 raw and the rest cooked. And I am not tempted to go back to the old way of eating. \n\nI had to take care of my father with Alzheimer's disease. Our children should not have that sort of burden and if my husband and I take better care of ourselves, we will be there to play with our grand children, not have to join them in diapers because we lost our minds.\n\nWhat sort of future do you want? The average person at retirement age is on 10 medications. I don't have to take any. I've gotten my husband off of dairy and soda pop, his blood pressure came down on its own, he did not need a the pills. \n\nHe is devoted to eating meat as if to give it up would kill him, actually the opposite is true.\n\nBut we prove what we want to prove to ourselves. I studied how I could cure my arthritis and I got hooked on doing research and finding a new adventure in how I could eat to improve my health.\n\nIs your health as important to you as mine is to me? I don't have skin cancer and I have no signs of any kinds of cancer. My sister died as 64, and I am a year older than she lived. She suffered dreadfully.

It's the ethical belief that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged and that certain actions are right or wrong, regardless of the context of the act. Almost no ethical philosophers on the planet believe in moral absolutism for good reason. In order for something to be a moral absolute, it has to universally agreed to be either morally right or morally wrong in every possible scenario. No such moral standard exists, because if there exists any gray area then it can't be a moral absolute. Examples: \n1) Stealing is wrong; except when it's to feed your family.\n2) Killing is wrong; except when it's in self-defense.\n3) Rape is wrong; except in a situation like the Handmaids Tale where only a handful of women could still reproduce and if they don't have sex then humanity will go extinct.\n\n\nThe last one is a bit of a stretch I'll admit, but the point is that if there exists any exceptions then it can't be an absolute.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "kalzoa", "channel": "UCGXjr608vugLFPGV3w4oUuA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTA5yomRpzdl3y4xDdI3XpWoFcv1Dw0Q4J8V4Co=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Of course there are no \"Absolute moral truths\" if by that you search for something which is absolutelly context-independent. That's because literally nothing in the universe is context-independent. But we here, on Earth, and in our society, have some context (for instance, being alive, or an animal, or a human being) which imply almost all of us will have some atomical \"truths\" in common which we see as obvious. I'm talking about purely logical and formal truths, which are the necessary bricks of every good argument ever made.\nOf course there's not a way to metaphysically dictate that those truths are absolute or even correct. We've just experienced for unnumerable instances that, when facing the world using logic and reason (even the most basic one, like \"I want that food, so I'll extend my hand to grab it\"), it has come out well.\nThat's to say, we have a global experience, as sentient beings, of some basic notions about the world which basically all of us can agree on. From there, we can build by reasoning and observing the world.\nSaying the vast majority agree on these basic bricks is not to say the vast majority will be right about any moral issue, for the real world and human relations distort our reasoning (and our brain isn't perfect), so we fail in our argumentations a lot (and some issues, we don't even think about).\nBut given, for instance, that almost all actual people will agree that it's better to maximize pleasure and minimize pain (utilitarian) and that most animals have sentience and feelings, as shown by science, (and both these assumptions are clearly shown by the fact that, for instance, almost all actual people will see unnecessarily beating up a dog as bad), just from those two it's possible to reason, only with basic logical truths, that eating animals is wrong (because, basically, it creates too much pain for them and too little pleasure for us).", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Mart√≠nSQ", "channel": "UCgCGg1OPZOnaVYnPLlVzZnQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQrH0CdZxCxLH5QXnb2NSPWg3syWjmIQhR9p2QfXA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You talk about atomical \"truths\" which most humans see as obvious. Then you go on to say that we have a global basic notions about the world which basically all of us can agree on. But then you start to say that just because the vast majority agree on these notions doesn't mean the vast majority will be right about any moral issue. So, if by your logic, the humans across the entire world have similar experiences and reasoning capabilities just as you do. If over 99% of them come to the conclusion that something is okay to do, what makes that 99% wrong and the 1% right? At the end of the day everyone believes they are right, so the argument can't just be \"I'm right because I believe I'm right\", obviously there is some factor that brought the 99% percent of human beings on Earth to the same logical conclusion.\n\n\nNow let's go over your logical reasoning for a second. You start by saying that people agree that it's better to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, I agree. As such, it would be wrong to unnecessarily beat your dog, or any animal for that matter. But then you make a leap to the logical conclusion that ergo eating animals is wrong, how so? Pain can be minimized in an animals death and no animal has to be beaten to obtain meat, so by your own logic meat is still okay so long as the animal was treated well and killed swiftly. Obviously, these factors do depend on where you get your meat but clearly you can see why others may come to a different logical conclusion that you have.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "kalzoa", "channel": "UCGXjr608vugLFPGV3w4oUuA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTA5yomRpzdl3y4xDdI3XpWoFcv1Dw0Q4J8V4Co=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgxxLA6FMkJyXD2eJkR4AaABAg.8a4UTB__nDF8nW9Y52dkSW", "text": "First off, about your first paragraph. You say that if, as I say, most people agree on basic logical truths, then automatically they'll agree on all complex statements (regarding philosophy, ethics, etc.). First off, this is clearly empirically untrue because of the wide array of opinions lots of people have in most matters (even if in some matters, like veganism, this array is not so wide, and more polarized). But it's also fairly understandable how come it be that humans with common basic moral truths arrive at different conclusions. Firstly, because not all humans have similar experiences at all, and lots of them stray them further from objective reasoning, or just don't even allow them (or make it difficult to do so) the questioning of certain accepted statements. Secondly, because the brain is a really complex system, and different brains are very different. It's understandable that most brains arrive at the same basic logical truths, because as I said they're mostly based in the observation of the world (even if they can later be expressed as formal logic) and we all are familiar with them to achieve the simplest of tasks. Complex truths that are built upon them, on the contrary, usually have to pass through a lot of observations and steps to be achieved, and something can go wrong in them. If the brain were a perfect computer, a formal system, that wouldn't happen. But the brain is a neural network with way too many connections (and physicality) to assure perfection in reasoning. There are just lots of other things (prejudices, biases, or plain malfunction) that are going on in the brain and prevent a proper formal argument.\nThat's why one can hold as true certain basical truths, and simultaneously hold as true some more complex truth which contradicts them. That's called cognitive dissonance.\nSo I of course wasn't stating veganism is right \"because I believe so\".\nI was arguing for veganism that eating animals contradicts the two basic truths I stated (maximize pleasure/minimize pain and that animals suffer and feel). And so, since these truths are accepted by most as obvious, and veganism on the other hand is a complex real issue, it's a strong argument that veganism is in fact correct, given it's the only option to follow these truths coherently.\n\nNow: you tell me those two truths don't imply veganism. But consider: if the animal is suffering, that clearly isn't worth the taste of meat.\nIf, on the other hand, the animal is living a perfectly enjoyful and free life (which is NOT the case in more than 95% of the meat produced), killing him is still immoral, for you are depriving him of the pleasure he could have felt in the rest of his life (of course, if the animal is killed way before its life expectancy, which is always done in the industry). You may tell me, that by killin him painlessly we're just not inflicting any damage on it. But, though it clearly is better than killing him painfully, negating his life is clearly a moral prejudice, and a big one. You would never consider killing a person ethical just because it was done painlessly. And don't get me wrong: I'm not saying it's as bad to kill a nonhuman animal as to kill a person. I'm just using the example because the situation is analogous: a sentient being who wants to live will be negated the rest of his life.\nAs another way to put it, you could say that, no matter how well you've treated the animal BEFORE killing him, at the moment of killing him you're committing a moral inconsistency just the same. And even more: if you've cared about the animal's wellbeing enough to treat it well until then, what does you suddenly consider it acceptable to prejudice him, to negate him such joy that he would live.\n\nAnd that's without entering in the matter that if we really had to care for all animals well, having them enjoyful and free, we'd quickly run out of space and resources. And on the other hand, a vegan diet utilizes 10 times less terrain (and some researchers even say 18 times less), and thus way less water, work, etc. and is thus way better for the environment. And also would allow to produce way more food, which would be good for humanity (I'm not saying the problem of people starving would be fixed by veganism, because we already produce 130% of the necessary food, but certainly more food would help).", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Mart√≠nSQ", "channel": "UCgCGg1OPZOnaVYnPLlVzZnQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQrH0CdZxCxLH5QXnb2NSPWg3syWjmIQhR9p2QfXA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There is an alarming amount of growth in precarity since the end of XX century and that pushes the middle class to go for cheap transportation and cheap groceries.

So \"asking\" people to be conscious is just one part of the job, the other part resides in a planned economy that can keep sustainable jobs and at the same time we could redistribute wealth so everyone could invest in sustainable sources of food/energy.

The problem with that statement is that you haven't met every single vegan to make that blanket assessment. If you did meet us all, you'd find most of us keep to ourselves. And since you haven't met the majority of Vegans (obviously how could you, we're quiet for the most part), your focus is on the few loud obnoxious ones who like to use social media to apply their activism. Their noise overshadows those of us who live by example rather than vocalize. And I'm not even mad at them. Bc I get why they're so passionate. It's a good cause & the opposition is horrifying. The extreme behavior of those vegans is reactionary & relative to the extreme behavior of the meat industry. They have a right to be upset. They wish to speak on behalf of the voiceless & powerless. As obnoxious as they are, their message is altruistic. I don't understand why anybody would allow the messenger to get in the way of accepting the validity of the message.

Meat is actually the cause of world starvation bc livestock has lead to land desertification & soil depletion. Due to this issue, corporations have sought out land in 3rd world countries either by creating deforestation or via corporate land grabs. 91% of the amazonian deforestation is a result of animal agriculture. Corporate land grabs cause small local farms to be unable to compete. This causes much of these farmers to either sell their land or go bankrupt. The corporations gain control over food prices & drive them up so that they are able to export them to feed the livestock that will ultimately feed the wealthy West. 3rd world ppl lose jobs on farms & go into poverty. And the ones who can hold unto jobs can't afford the high prices driven by these corporations. Let's not forget our own economy stands to gain from cutting out meat since most of the industry takes its subsidies from our taxes. In regards to the fish, mercury is the least of our problems. Over 85% of fisheries are currently exploited & our oceans are expected to go extinct by 2048 if we continue at this rate. Our consumer demand leads to all kinds of problems I haven't even mentioned, the amount of fuel & water & land resources required is unsustainable. Deforestation leads to the displacement of indigenous ppl. Farmers in the US are trapped into horrible contracts & debt with the meat industry.

Here are the figures:\nLettuce -- 15 gallons;\nTomatoes -- 22 gallons;\nCabbage -- 24 gallons;\nCucumber -- 28 gallons;\nPotatoes -- 30 gallons;\nOranges -- 55 gallons; \nApples -- 83 gallons;\nBananas -- 102 gallons;\nCorn -- 107 gallons;\nPeaches or Nectarines -- 142 gallons;\nMango -- 190 gallons\nVS\nEggs -- 573 gallons; \nChicken -- 815 gallons;\nCheese -- 896 gallons;\nPork -- 1630 gallons; \nButter -- 2044 gallons; \nBeef -- 2500-5000 gallons\n\nI didn't say Indigenous ppl were vegans or cause of the problems. I said they were the victims. Due to agribusiness cutting down protected rainforests for raising livestock & animal feed, they've forced out natives from their homes. These lands are stolen from them just to satisfy us Westerner's tastebuds for a burger. \n\nI specifically mentioned the ocean's fisheries being depleted, over 85% to be exact. Based on your misinterpretation of my Indigenous comment, I'm not surprised you misread thin as well. And no its not just salt-water species. The excess manure that's being run off into waterways is creating algae-infested pools & hypoxic dead zones which kill all kinds of fish in lakes, rivers, saltwater basins & ocean. And it's not simply the indiscriminate manner that fishing employs, but also the growing populations' demand that is causing the fish to deplete. As China and India beginning to eat more meat-based, they'll also funnel in more demand. The population will grow to 10 billion by 2050. \n\nIt seems that you want to maintain your cognitive dissonance & not admit to the impacts that one industry has. I haven't even touched on its lobbyist grip on Congress & how their Ag-gag law and hunting mandates prevent us from keeping these mafia-like corporations in check. I didn't even mention the environmental activists who are assassinated for speaking out or the ones who are placed on the FBI's terrorist watch list. \n\nThe amount of corruption is real. But if you want to fund them just to keep your palate happy, then I hope your conscience is clear. I couldn't do it. I'd never allow my palate to have more power than my mind. For me, principle outweighs convenience. I often wonder on what side of history I'd have been on during Slavery Abolition or the Women's Suffrage movement. I'd like to think that based on my fight for the voiceless & powerless today, that I can confidently say I'd have been on the right side of history.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "YourMajesty143", "channel": "UCNV-z5HXmj4ZRtiDXmPsLyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRIZY6ykcNQCOkd6OBxP1muK1XBM23u0FV8LQi6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets.

That amount is enough to keep you well fed and strong, and also keep your greenhouse emissions under control.

For me, for example, it's about the fullness, meat is mostly protein which is very filling, so sometimes I just eat a salad with mozzarella cheese (high in protein and fats). The same goes for fish, especially one that doesn't stink, chicken, and tofu.\n\nIt takes a while to find what you like but after a while it becomes part of your diet, not just a fancy replacement for beef. Being sensible in your food choices isn't about propaganda, it's about going away with our previously learned food habits, which can be very tough. That is why post people don't do it.\n\np.s. They mentioned this about the mediterranean diet, but it might have slipped. It contains a lot of olive oil. When my mom makes a sallad, there's a ton of olive oil in it. And there's a good reason for it -- fats are tasty, very high in energy, and satiating, so they have the same effect as proteins.

In fact it's been proven many times that the optimal amount of animal protein in the human diet is zero. Many studies have also shown that the plant based diet can prevent and even reverse many diseases like cancer, heart disease or diabetes type two.  If you interested in that you can check out 'www.nutritionfacts.org' or the documentaries 'Forks Over Knifes' and 'What The Health' on Netflix. 'Mic the Vegan' is also a good YouTube-channel to check out.\n\nAnd what is wrong with eating meat substitutes and other vegan animal product like foods?

It consumes much more land because much more crops are consumed per day than meat (you probably eat around 200% more grain than chicken a day).\n\nNot only that, but many vegans consume market oil, which is developed from animal fat; animal fats are also used industrially very commonly. To take away these animal fats would require new replacements to be developed, which is costly and isnt always doable.\n\nVeganism has its arguments, and it has its counterarguments. If somebody doesn't want to be vegan or does, it's their choice, and you have no right to enforce what you don't even know is truly beneficial to the world on somebody else.\n\nVeganism is also not necessarily healthier. High protein, mineral and Carbohydrate consumption combined with high activity and physical stress builds muscle and develops the immune system much faster and more efficiently than vegetarianism. Many male athletes consume a lot of meat for a reason. That being said, without that high physical stress, the protein and minerals go out of your system and you just gain fat, in which case veganism is much better.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Jason Peng", "channel": "UCILghfTGW8D6l_TdwpzAccg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1hUJece7wVrP7kl-GUyaV58sNTr02aW7h-O2WuA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Clazza, as OP mentioned just because animals do something in the wild does not at all mean it is ethical for humans to do that. We have a CHOICE to eat meat. People choose to eat meat because it tastes good even though it causes immense suffering to millions of factory farmed animals and is terrible for the planet. Wild animals do not have this choice. Also for people saying plants feel pain, do you really think that pain is comparable to what intelligent animals like pigs or cows feel? Many plants evolved to have part of themselves be eaten. Many flowering plants would not reproduce if animals didn't eat their fruit and spread their seeds. And to Jason Peng, veganism does require much less land than a traditional American omnivorous diet. First of all, livestock, especially grazing animals, require lots of land. And secondly, you have to feed the animals something. If humans ate what we fed to animals, that would be much more efficient and use much less land. Energy is lost at each trophic level, so when we eat a chicken that ate some grain, we gain 90% less energy than if we just ate all the grain the chicken ate.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "swasomekayaker", "channel": "UCE1WRFVsncM8dUbwo7OemLw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSTejbhntvoIt0gw9djW0hcCbhU3ZlYQHp1oA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It consumes much more land because much more crops are consumed per day than meat (you probably eat around 200% more grain than chicken a day).\n\nNot only that, but many vegans consume market oil, which is developed from animal fat; animal fats are also used industrially very commonly. To take away these animal fats would require new replacements to be developed, which is costly and isnt always doable.\n\nVeganism has its arguments, and it has its counterarguments. If somebody doesn't want to be vegan or does, it's their choice, and you have no right to enforce what you don't even know is truly beneficial to the world on somebody else.\n\nVeganism is also not necessarily healthier. High protein, mineral and Carbohydrate consumption combined with high activity and physical stress builds muscle and develops the immune system much faster and more efficiently than vegetarianism. Many male athletes consume a lot of meat for a reason. That being said, without that high physical stress, the protein and minerals go out of your system and you just gain fat, in which case veganism is much better.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Jason Peng", "channel": "UCILghfTGW8D6l_TdwpzAccg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1hUJece7wVrP7kl-GUyaV58sNTr02aW7h-O2WuA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Just because there isn't a guarantee of success doesn't mean the risk isn't worth taking. Sometimes being the first to take an actually good enough product to market is all it takes to become very successful. It's generally easier and cheaper to grow and process plants into various foods than meat. Maybe it will require a lot of R&D, but a good meat substitute that is cheaper than meat is not far from possible. A lot more work than you seem to know of has already been done. You're thinking \"What would it be like if some startup started from scratch now\" and \"what would it be like immediately after they did it\" as if that's always how it will be. If they can get fast food restaurants to use the cheaper meat substitute, they could make a lot of money. If it's easy for busy parents to feed their kids with and the kids don't complain about it, there's a market too.\n\nYour example with the bacon and the carrot simply doesn't work because it implies that a bacon substitute could only taste like carrot or some other vegetable. Those don't even have the nutrients that are necessary for a meat replacement. Bacon is not something you should eat frequently though, so I do not think it would be worth the effort of replacing. When you eat bacon, you should know you're eating junk food. Pork and steak are the 2 most in need of a good substitute and certainly not as difficult as bacon. Meat does have a taste, but not much of one and it's easy to overpower.
