The IPCC corrected this, and rightfully, as the reference was not a peer-reviewed article but an online post by the WWF. For the claim of 50m refugees, I have never come across such a claim in an IPCC report. Where can I find it?\n\n\"Why can't scientist say \"I don't know?\" it's obvious they didn't accurately predict 30 years into the future 30 years ago. What changed? Why are they better now? There excuse \"They were trying to scare us into action.\" I doubt it, I believe they were simply wrong and don't want to admit it. How can we be sure they are being honest with us now and not again trying to scare us into action.\"\n\nThey never say that they do know; science is rarely about proving. That's why the projections are reported in levels of statistical significance, i.e. likely (p < 0.1) or extremely likely (p < 0.05). And it's why the IPCC has produced 5 ARs and not just one; knowledge is being continuously updated and refined.

That's caused by both factory farming of animals and vegan/lowered meat diets. Ethical farmers are now starting to reverse this trend, which means more & more of the food you eat that you think is \"vegan\" is not anyway, since it's only made possible by the use of fertiliser that comes from farmed animals, but it's also worth noting that mined chemical phosphorous supplies, that are the ONLY option for growing vegan diets are expected to run out within 50 years. They are also the cause of all the farm run off issues that damage rivers, oceans etc. Properly managed grazing animals, or grazing animals/crop rotations of farms simply don't cause chemical run offs & the consequential environmental vandalism.\n\nYou also might want to note that rice currently causes 15-20% of human related methane emissions, despite crop land areas being WAY lower than cow grazing land areas. If you were to replace animal farming with rice, the methane production would be astronomically higher than current human induced levels (mind you, that's impossible anyway, most cattle are grazed in semi-arid areas incapable of supporting crop growth, removing them from food production simply shrinks available food production space on the planet\n\nNot a lot of links there, but plenty of info that you can google to see I'm telling the truth when I say vegan diets are incredibly bad for the planet, second only to factory farming", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Climate change references an intensification of the greenhouse effect, which leads to an imbalance of Earth's energy budget. The specific heat capacity of an object will not lead to the heating of an entire planet; you don't understand basic thermodynamics if you really think so. The amount of energy on Earth—both kinetic and potential—is constant, and only varies based on the amount of energy added from outside sources (notably the sun) or released out of our atmosphere. When our atmosphere gets thicker and the greenhouse effect intensifies, the amount of energy released decreases, leading the planet to get hotter. This is fifth grade science.\n\nYou mentioned paint and solar panels. The color white reflects all frequencies of visible light, meaning more energy is reflected away from the surface of Earth; though with a denser atmosphere, this wouldn't help much. Solar panels are highly reflective, and also reflect excess energy away from the Earth's surface and store some of it as potential energy; electricity. The amount of CO2 released by plants in a dark room, even, is too minuscule to affect the amount of CO2 in a room to a level noticeable by humans.\n\nYou've yet to substantiate to any degree that any of these things contribute more to climate change than CO2.

You think that because reflective power plants, glass, roads, etc reflect a lot of heat, that heat must be heating the Earth. But this is simply misunderstanding of energy transfer.\n\nA more or less constant amount of thermal solar energy is hitting the planet at all times in the form of infrared radiation. This is Earth's only external source of heating, and so long as the amount of thermal energy being radiated away from Earth is equal to the amount being absorbed, the planet will not heat up. Energy IN = Energy OUT: good. Energy IN > Energy OUT: bad. Since the energy IN is constant, the ONLY thing that matters in this equation is how much thermal energy is being radiated away from our planet. As it turns out, the only thing mediating how much thermal energy is allowed to escape is the atmosphere. Without the atmosphere, Earth would be a frozen, -18 degrees C, floating icicle in space.\n\nThe oxygen and nitrogen within our atmosphere are completely transparent to infrared radiation, they do not absorb the heat directly. However, certain molecules in the atmosphere DO directly absorb infrared radiation, namely CO2 (carbon dioxide), H2O (water) and CH4 (methane). These molecules slow heat from escaping out into space by absorbing the thermal energy and emitting it back down towards Earth's surface; acting like a blanket. The concentration of these molecules in the atmosphere directly dictates the temperature of the entire planet. It doesn't matter how many roads or reflective solar farms you build, as they don't prevent heat from escaping, they don't 'trap heat' like the atmosphere does.", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "ASomewhatLongAndMeaninglessUserame", "channel": "UC5oSaHv4brSEEmfWERMlW6g", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR3znN8oaWEq-nydcQgmiGKqDH9m7ziU7PIGYRU=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'll try to explain why H20 is also greenhouse gas but you should learn about chemistry to have a better understanding. A greenhouse gas is a GAS that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing IR radiation . Conceptually this causes the bonds of the molecule to stretch or bend until eventually the IR radiation is re-emitted back towards the earth essentially trapping the IR radiation within the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse gas effect. Only certain molecules can absorb IR radiation. These molecules have dipoles (difference in charges between atoms) between bonds. This enables the stretching and bending of the intramolecular bonds. H20 has has this dipole and as a result can also absorb IR radiation but, the difference is that H20 can be quickly removed from the atmosphere because it turns into precipitation unlike CO2 which takes a very long time to be removed naturally.

The greenhouse effect in exists: The greenhouse effect itself is not a claim, but an absolute fact. The proof is pretty much in the name. Humanity has used greenhouses for centuries. A dome, or 'house', made of glass is significantly warmer on the inside than it is on the outside. This due to the greenhouse effect, hence the name. One can't simply deny the greenhouse effect without being intellectually dishonest.\n\n2. Carbon dioxide causes a greenhouse effect: This fact has been proven time and time again with not only lab experiments and computer simulations, but also with terrestrial and extraterrestrial atmospheric data; one of the most commonly cited being that of venus. I'm sure you've heard the venus argument, so I won't bore you with the details. The fact is, the greenhouse effect (specifically in greenhouses) put simply, is caused because of glass's ability to absorb infrared radiation and re-emit that energy back into the greenhouse; this specific property is similar in carbon dioxide.

The sun can explain less than 10% of the increase in temperature since 1750, and none of the increase in temperature since 1960.\n\nPatterns of vertical temperature change (from the Earth’s surface to the upper atmosphere) provide further evidence that the sun cannot be responsible for the observed changes in climate. An increase in solar output would warm the atmosphere consistently from top to bottom. Warming from increasing heat-trapping gases, on the other hand, should be concentrated in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), while the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) would cool. Satellite measurements and weather balloon records reveal that the troposphere has warmed, and the stratosphere has cooled. This observed pattern of vertical temperature change matches what we would expect from the increase in heat-trapping gases, not an increase in solar output.\n\nChanges in the sun’s magnetic field are known to affect the intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth’s atmosphere and there is some suggestion that this could affect cloud formation; however, observations indicate that the magnitude of this effect is much smaller than the effects from the human-related changes in heat-trapping gases and from particle emissions on clouds and the changes in climate. \n\n Large explosive volcanic eruptions can cool climate for a few years after an eruption, if the eruption is powerful enough to send particles far up into the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide from volcanoes is converted into sulfuric acid particles that can scatter sunlight, cooling the Earth’s surface. Particles from exceptionally large eruptions like Mount Pinatubo in 1991 or Krakatoa in 1883 can reach all the way into the stratosphere, where they can stay for several years. Eventually, they fall back into the troposphere where they are rapidly removed by precipitation. Volcanoes also emit carbon dioxide, but this amount is less than 1% annually of the emissions occurring from human activities.\n\nThus, natural factors cannot explain recent warming. In fact, observed solar and volcanic activity would have tended to slightly cool the Earth, and other natural variations are too small to account for the amount of warming over the last 50 years.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Sasquatchan Bearhunter", "channel": "UC463eN99ys4YYkUcRir3Z6A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS22yHlomHxZa2vNRNOj0WUCmvNY5kGeGjIGiHl=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I know Vox is left wing media, but Steven Crowder a conservative podcast brought an \"actual\" scientist that studied Hurricanes and even worked on NASA with more than 20 years of expirience and said that Hurricanes aren't caused by CO2 emmission.

Nobody is willing to accept the act that we have caused this, when i say nobody, i mean that as in there is too little of people actually working towards a change. we even have people with great amounts of money, power, or intellect who refuse to help because it might not benefit them. But why worry about getting something beneficial out of saving the goddamn planet from being killed. we as humans have been a parasite if you look at it from a certain perspective. We are a parasite due to the fact that all we have been doing is taking. Taking resources, taking lives, taking land, and so on and so fourth. Because of us just taking and taking we've ruined our planet from what it once was. I mean technically we have been dooming ourselves to die out. with the planet heating up, climate has taken a huge change. Forest fires have gotten more common and biomes are changing too, getting warmer with less rain than usual, winds getting faster and harsher. Where i currently live i have experienced this first hand, less water, more winds. we used to never get any type of twister or cyclone but now its becoming a common factor here. I know this statement wont do anything, but my main message I want to get across is that we all need to notice and live up to what we as humans have done, and sure, having just you, one person may not do much, but as the numbers grow with more and more people helping in the slightest way to help rebuild what we had ruined, we may just make our planet last just a little longer for us to live on, for all i know we could maybe bring earth back into its proper state if we could all work together to fix this hell hole we have made\n\n(please excuse any miss types or improper sentence form factors) \nps my actual name for those whom wish to use this in a video as a quote potentially, my name is Tyson Hill, so if you use this little speel i have made, give credit to me where its due", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Cyver.X Music And Gaming", "channel": "UCLV_LAKiwrqS0L0PLREgHcQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSLcz9dekrNnKkA3HSJTNFBnkIIYrGm6eSblrzH-Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Instead just go to your local farmers market. Yes, they use cars and trucks but at least you reduce your \"cost\" to only trucks. \n3rd point. spot on. Instead of buying a new car, just use your old one till it breaks. Buying an electric car to get rid of your current car causes more damage than just buying  a 2nd hand car OR just continuing to use your old one. \nlastly, we should all do our part in this and TRY to reduce. If it causes damage to your own life than dont do it. For instance if you need to drive and there is no buses near the area, just drive. Remember the point of this is to DELAY global warming.

We already know how to do it, it's called plants! \nYou are ABSOLUTELY right that infrastructure needs to be built to deal with climate change! Even just at the levels we're seeing today & if we start reversing now, that is still financially sound to do when you look at the damage that occurs everytime a climate change enhanced storm hits an area that hasn't been upgraded to best practice building given current climate change knowledge\n\nBack to fossil fuels/ reversal, lets remember that even if we made a complete switch to renewables today, it wouldn't in anyway reverse anything & like you say there's a lag time, but there's also other carbon releases in progress, in particular destruction of forests & degradation of cropland soils, as their topsoil & fertility is lost, what's actually being lost is  carbon & 40% of the world's croplands are degraded to the point that they can only produce if massive quantities of chemical fertilisers are added to them. These soils had on average 20-30% carbon (the blacker the soil, the more carbon in it) before industrial farming. Most industrially farmed soils now have less than 5% carbon left & the amount keeps dropping! That's a LOT of carbon being released into the air! (around 1 gigaton of carbon a year in America alone right now)\n\nSounds bad, but it actually has the potential to be VERY GOOD too! There's 5 billion hectares of seasonal grasslands currently on the planet. With properly managed intensive rotational grazing, they can add 1/2-1% carbon back into the soil in 1 year. That's 100 tonnes of CO2 for every hectare managed with Serengeti style rotational grazing (where huge herds of livestock are grazed for a single day on a small section of land, then moved to the next section & so on for a year - each section that gets the large herd for 1 day and is then is allowed to rest until grasses mature sequesters carbon at that rate, after grass maturity, the herd can be brought back in for another day to add another 1% carbon to the soil).\n\nSo it's actually possible to return to pre-industrial CO2 levels within around 20 years if half the world's grasslands have this system applied to them. It can be done with large herds of wild ruminants if desired, but farm animals like cows are just as effective & as a side effect produce masses of food & we're talking land that's already available, no trees need to be chopped down or anything & most of the land available is currently suffering desertification & this system also reverses that. Here's a video, linked to the point of the pics showing the impact on desert like land https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI?t=984\n\nWe still need to reduce oil & increase renewables, but there ARE financially viable options (low cost to set up & actually increase profits significantly when done), with currently available technology that we can use today to actually start sucking large amounts of Carbon back out of the air to avoid crossing that tipping point.

{"cid": "UgwGHIry59xjX8Flbvd4AaABAg", "text": "Ok so... the main reason why hurricane Harvey has resulted in so much flooding is mainly because it stalled out and there wasn't anything going on in that part of the atmosphere to move it away from that area. So it's basically a hurricane/tropical storm hovering over the same location for days. Texas is relatively flat so it doesn't weaken storms as quickly as mountainous terrain. However, that being said, hurricane Harvey developed extremely quick (rapid intensification). It basically went from being a disorganized storm to a category 4 monster within 48 hours (maybe a LITTLE more or less, don't quote me on that). This kind of intensification occurred mainly due to the favorable atmospheric conditions and the extremely warm ocean temperatures. So yes, global warming can lead to stronger storms developing quicker due to the warmer seas but the main reason why Harvey was/is so bad was because it stalled out, pouring endless rain on the area not really because of its strength. \n\nI do agree we need to reduce our carbon footprint and we need to worry about climate change because it is real. There's a lot of different things that make up hurricanes and the damage they do.

Yucca mountain was an area designated to hold nuclear waste underground and far away from everyone. However, for some reason, the government denied its usage 20 years ago, and now we have little place to put the waste. With this information, two things need to be solved. One, Yucca Mountain (or something like it) needs to be designated by the government to hold this waste temporarily. Two, scientists need to find ways to neutralize or reverse the effects of nuclear waste and perfect the system of creating nuclear energy. The reason this has not happened yet is because the discretionary budget for science was around 31 billion dollars, or 3 percent of the discretionary budget in 2016, which applied to all of science research.

Let's try to leave malice aside, scientists can change fields during their career, it's more common than you think. If something is not working, they just leave it and go other places. Keeping a massive conspiracy secret is way more difficult than people seem to think.\n\nThere's a paper from Etheridge et al. 1996 \"Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric CO2 over the last 1000 years from air in Antarctic ice and firn\" that takes in account many of Jaworowski objections: they identify where was melting in the record and avoid it, they identify no clathrates and they use different drilling methods and show that there is no effect whatsoever on the concentrations. In fact, Etheridge et al. calculate the uncertainty of CO2 measurements in 1.2 ppm.\n\nI propose that you consider another explanation for the data change: technique refinement. It has been more than 30 years since Neftel et al., and some times people make mistakes. Time passes, people learn and start taking better measurements (from cooler places, better drilling, careful handling, etc). We understand better everything that can go wrong, people (like Jaworowski) voice their concerns and steps are taken to check and minimize the contaminations. We have lowered uncertainty and records from different parts of the world are consistent. We just got better.\n\nDo you have something more recent than 1996 about problems with CO2 measurements in ice cores?\n\nAnyway, the big hint about Jaworowski's work reliability today should be that even denialists trust the CO2 ice core data and accept that CO2 levels have increased since the industrial revolution.

What you meant to say was that these scientists found politically incorrect results, so they decided to never report higher results for their subsequent studies.\n\n\"In presenting measurements of CO2 concentrations in the pre-industrial ice core from Byrd Antarctica, Neftel, et al., in 1982 showed maximum values of up to 500 ppmv. In 1988, the same authors published measurements for the same section of the Byrd ice core, but left off the high readings previously published, reporting a high of 290 ppmv, in agreement with the global warming theory.\n\nUntil 1985, the published CO2 readings from air bubbles in pre-industrial ice ranged from 160 to about 700 ppmv, and occasionally even up to 2,450 ppmv. After 1985, the high readings disappeared from the publications! To fit such a wide range of results to the anthropogenic climatic warming theory, which was based on low pre-industrial CO2 levels, three methods were used: (1) rejection of high readings from sets of pre-industrial samples, based on the credo: “The lowest CO2 values represent the best CO2 concentrations in the originally trapped ice”, (2) rejection of low readings from 20th century samples; and (3) interpretation of the high readings from pre-industrial samples as representing the contemporary atmosphere rather than the pre-industrial one.\n\nPearman, et al. “on examination of the data,” rejected 43 percent of the CO2 readings from Law Dome, Antarctica core, 39 percent of the CH4 [methane] readings, and 43 percent of the N2O [nitrous oxide] readings, because they were higher or lower than the assumed “correct”' values.\n\nLeuenberger and Siegenthaler claimed that their data from a Greenland ice core demonstrate that the present level of N2O in the atmosphere, 310 ppmv, is an effect of a recent 19 percent increase caused by industrial activity. To reach this conclusion, they rejected 27 percent of the samples with N2O readings deemed to be “too high” for pre-industrial ice.\n\nEtheridge et al. claimed that their ice core results show a pre-industrial N2O concentration of 285 ppbv. This value was calculated after rejection of 44 percent of their measurements! From the remaining analyses, the high readings from the 16th and 17th century ice, ...which were higher than 20th century samples,...were again eliminated without explanation.\"\n\nYour scientists are dishonest. You're not going to convince me. Your only argument will be simply to reassert that \"older data was wrong, so the scientists had to fix it\", i.e. a rationalization for fraud to reaffirm your bias.\n\nThe technique itself will determine how much co2 they find.

The difference is that the story has to be plausible according to known science. Instead, what we have are allegations of established climate science amidst a dogfight saying it is bullshit and bafflegab. Political orientation stories confirm this is the way people are looking at this - rhetoric and tricks running roughshod over any realization that more is at stake than panic over climate and/or weather. Weathermen/meteorologists know weather cannot be predicted accurately much more than a week. Rounding errors and convection effects from rain or snow are not just transient affairs. They change conditions and readings. And then there is the matter of barometric pressure. Where I live there are strong winds from the mountains which would wreck any presumption the sunshine available determines temperature values - though certainly seasons change due to angle of incidence and and hours of daylight. But I am supposed to be concerned about CO2 when it has always tracked temperature as a consequence rather than a cause.\nWhat do scientists say ? Mostly they STFU because they have jobs to protect. But if the answers are known, why do we need researchers ? But they are not. Really. There is just a lot of ratchetjawing that conversation and contention are passe.

The problem with the IPCC and mainstream climatology is that they are flat-earthers and gravity deniers.\n\n\"Adding to the list of scientists and mathematicians who have disproven conventional greenhouse gas theory, Russian physicists OG Sorokhtin, GV Chilingar, and LF Khilyuk noted in their book Global warming and global cooling. Evolution of climate on earth. Developments in Earth & Environmental Sciences (Elsevier 2007) that conventional greenhouse theory is not based on sound physical derivation, with most calculations and predictions based on intuitive models using numerous poorly defined parameters and unproven positive feedback forcing from CO2. Most conventional interpretations and models, such as those of the IPCC, consider only one component of heat transfer- radiation- to create a flat earth radiation budget of the atmosphere, ocean, and land masses, and do not adequately address the impact of e.g. convection and circulation on a rotating sphere. In contrast, the Sorokhtin et al adiabatic theory considers earth as an open, dissipative system that can be described by non-linear equations of mathematical physics, taking into account the formation of stable thermodynamic structures in each compartment, between compartments, and ruled by strong negative feedbacks (e.g. convection, water cycles, clouds). They devised a model based on well-established relationships among physical ﬁelds describing the mass and heat transfer in the atmosphere and subsequently published the paper Cooling of Atmosphere Due to CO2.\n\nThe main conclusions of this work are:\n\n1. Convection accounts for approximately 67% of the total amount of heat transfer from the Earth's surface to the troposphere, the condensation of water vapour for 25% and radiation accounts for only 8%. As the heat transfer in the troposphere occurs mostly by convection, accumulation of CO2 in the troposphere intensifies the convective process of heat and mass transfer, because of the intense absorption of infrared radiation, and leads to subsequent cooling and not warming as commonly believed.\n\n2. The analysis indicates that the average surface temperature of the earth is determined by the solar constant, the precession angle of the planet, the mass (pressure) of the atmosphere, and the specific heat of the atmospheric mixture of gases. \n\n3. If the nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of the earth would be replaced by a CO2 atmosphere with the same pressure of 1 atm, then the average near-surface temperature would decrease by approximately 2.5 °C and not increase as commonly assumed. \n\n4. The opposite will happen by analogy if the CO2 atmosphere of Venus would be replaced by a nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere at a pressure of 90.9 atm. The average near-surface temperature would increase from 462 °C to 657 °C. This is explained easily by observing how the results of the derived formulas are affected, considering that the molecular weight of CO2 is about 1.5 times greater and its speciﬁc heat 1.2 times smaller than those of the earth's air. \n\n5. If the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere increases from 0.035% to its double value of 0.070%, the atmospheric pressure will increase slightly (by 0.00015 atm). Consequently the temperature at sea level will increase by about 0.01°C and the increase in temperature at an altitude of 10 km will be less than 0.03°C. These amounts are negligible compared to the natural temporal ﬂuctuations of the global temperature.\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Zoe Phin", "channel": "UCjXQRYWGPu6jIIZF5p-QvKA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQDRx_C7fwow5aVbFgrIJIVPnA2bbvjfefjgmWf=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This makes it hard if not nearly impossible to get an accurate account of the global temperature.'\n\nYour statement here requires qualification.  Please, share your evidence that the data is not enough to demonstrate the global warming we're discussing and address the diversity of attempts to measure climate around the world, like the ARGO program, for example, with its thousands of swimming devices.  There are many different countries contributing data to determine the global record, derived independently from different perspectives.\n\nYou also say, 'I'm also not suggesting the planet isn't warming as it is and there's no doubt about that.

Intellectually dishonest individuals who are incapable of accepting the existence of scholarly papers contrary to their alarmist ideology have chosen to smear the highly credentialed scientists who authored these papers with libelous ad hominem attacks - falsely implying they are corrupt. No remote evidence has ever been presented that shows a skeptical scientist has changed their position on an issue due to a funding source. While honest investigations have shown these attacks to be baseless: Are Skeptical Scientists funded by ExxonMobil? The problem with the corruption argument is that it implies that scientists and researchers who rely primarily on public funding for their climate work are not motivated to tailor their research to the beliefs and policy views of their funding sources. Yet, policy analyses have shown that public funding of science may be susceptible to producing biased results. Regardless, to claim a largely uncoordinated grassroots movement of skeptical scientists are winning the debate against a highly organized climate monopoly that has received over $79 billion in funding because they were granted a paltry $2 million a year from companies like Exxon-Mobil is beyond laughable.\n\nThe Truth about DeSmogBlog\n\n\"DeSmogBlog is a smear site founded by a scientifically unqualified public relations man, James Hoggan and funded by a convicted money launderer, John Lefebvre. The irony here is their favorite tactic is to attempt to smear those they disagree with as funded by \"dirty money\". Since its creation in 2006 the site has done nothing but post poorly researched propaganda with a clear intent to smear respected scientists, policy analysts or groups who dare oppose an alarmist position on global warming. Their articles frequently reference unreliable sources such as Wikipedia and Sourcewatch since they are unable to find any fact based criticisms of those they attack in respected news sources. They have even been caught editing Wikipedia to create their own material to cite.

Without an atmosphere, average global temperatures would be -18°C.\n\nGreenhouse gases that are most relevant are Water vapor, CO2, Ozone & Methane. CO2 lets most incoming radiation pass through, but absorbs a significant wavelength of outgoing infrared radiation.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#/media/File:Atmospheric_Transmission.png\n\nNatural factors such as total solar input, volcanic eruptions, Milankovitch cycles or cosmic rays do not explain the recent warming, but CO2 does.\nhttps://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e97f9181362bc92cce499fb5d487724\n\nAverage global temperatures are rising:\nwww.climate.gov/maps-data#global-climate-dashboard\n\nSea levels are rising:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/\n\nGlaciers are retreating:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850#/media/File:Glacier_Mass_Balance.png\n\nArctic sea ice is receding:\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/\n\nThe CO2 we put into the atmosphere is to a large extent not reversible. A significant percentage of what we emit will persist in atmosphere for tens of thousands of years. This is not a path we want to go down.\nhttps://petermo.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/solomon-et-al-irreversible-change-f1large.jpg?w=500&h=980\n\nCO2 levels absolutely can lag temperature. CO2 levels also lead temperature changes:\nhttps://skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature.htm\n\nAre you willing to bet it all that CO2 is not a problem? Really? You'd put at risk your future, your planets future, your children's future. That doesn't make sense. Even if there was a small chance of major disaster, any normal person would take action to eliminate or mitigate massive risk.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Gary Sarela", "channel": "UCTnt1ZxGFjOqQbYo4X7mRxg", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQn6zBH1a8vbOi5NzyPUwhtfM0av4Tr-sD0cVFG7g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

For Example: Scotland under Thatcher was decimated: everything was trialed in Scotland, if it failed, it was kept in place, if it was successful, it was stopped and implemented in England. Scottish people were poor, up until it received its own Parliament and in 2007 under the SNP, Social Capitalism was adopted - now we're the second richest region in the UK after London with a GDPpc of $45,000, and increasing rapidly.

The only downside to thorium is you need just a little bit of plutonium to start it reacting, but this also makes it safer as if something goes wrong you just move the barely reactive liquid thorium away from the plutonium and the reaction will stop.

Check out holistic grazing or managed rotational grazing. It's actually very easy and cheap to reverse the levels (but also drops profits for those currently selling chemicals etc to factory farms and vegans don't like it, so both sides are attacking the idea).

This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.\n\nThe heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century. Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.\n\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.\n\nSource NASA: https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ (read more)", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Abhinav Reddy", "channel": "UCzyggxuIcwq7mmjVNLwlDFQ", "votes": "13", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTwSnyPIp9kso9QYCrNHKk8zc0BgXGmUJgs9xPEHg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.\n\nThe heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century. Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.\n\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming.\n\nSource NASA: https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ (read more)", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Abhinav Reddy", "channel": "UCzyggxuIcwq7mmjVNLwlDFQ", "votes": "51", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTwSnyPIp9kso9QYCrNHKk8zc0BgXGmUJgs9xPEHg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
