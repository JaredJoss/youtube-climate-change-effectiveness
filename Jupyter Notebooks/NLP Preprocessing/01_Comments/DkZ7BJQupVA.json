If we don’t take action, the collapse of civilization and the extinction of our natural world are on the horizon. The people of the world have spoken, and their message is clear: time is running out. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are now 50 percent higher than they were in 1900.\n\nThe world has become so fragile that we cannot subject the Earth to the tortures we can now inflict upon it. We are tampering with the climate of the Earth and the atmosphere we breathe. Not only are we piling carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but we are chopping down the forests of the Earth at a great rate. These problems are life and death problems. \r\n\nThey go to the root of the viability of the planet itself, making the Earth a lot less livable! We are dealing with issues that cut across national boundaries. When we talk about the greenhouse effect, we are talking about something that affects the entire planet. The world must band together to address the challenges and concerns as a whole. A human solution is the only way to solve a problem. \n\r\nOne thing about the human species that is biologically certain is that it is a human species. ONE species. Who is going to fight? Who is going to lead in the directions? Never can we sit back and wait for miracles to save us. Miracles don’t happen. Sweat happens, effort happens, thought happens. Have all that happen.

First, global warming seems like something that only happened in the future and only indirectly affecting them (e.g polar bears and developing countries). While the ozone hole seems like something urgent because it's already happened and it can causes skin cancer to anyone. Second, people can only choose what's affordable (in terms of price, accessibility, etc) to them.\n\nIn ozone hole, you can just not use CFC products which is less urgent than what you have to lose if you want to help global warming. In global warming, there can be so much that you can do yet it can be such a drastic change depending where you live, what can you buy, etc. Hence why, rather than highlighting sporadic individual change, we should highlight the system that we built in first.\n\nIn ozone holes, if elites ready to lose the CFC company sales, then individual will accordingly adapt to it. In global warming, if elites ready to let unsustainable energy go like coal and oil, then individual will also adapt though needs much more help.\n\nGrassroots need to be included in climate plan.

We believe this is related to recent batches of bearings and we are in discussions with the supplier” (see our post here).\nAnd Siemens’ ‘luck’ has been no better in the US, where its – barely-out-of-nappies – turbines literally fell apart in the Californian desert: 2 Year Old Siemens Turbines Falling Apart: Wind Farm Investors, Get Out While You Can\nSiemens aren’t having any better luck closer to home.\nIn Denmark, the Ørsted offshore wind farm at Anholt was completed in 2013. Barely 5 years later and the turbines’ blades are so worn out that hundreds of them need to be dismantled, returned to dry land and repaired.  Denmark also has the highest energy costs on the planet most of if not all of the windmills will have to be replaced after only 25% of the usage windmills are not reliable", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "death to socialism", "channel": "UCiqAqi7mP0B7KgUtb2Oap_w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRmxrJisZ1JNzrwhB42C2nZ1E0m1yNS-ijXIMw5qQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "ballomni", "channel": "UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSu_PGYp6k79oSFOphOwlNS5Wi2I0lOCWhISZo=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Almost puts the blame on our individual uses of water, electricity, etc. when multi billion dollar companies are responsible for much of the emissions, environmental pollution, and the stemming societal problems. In a capitalist system these companies will keep exploiting the land until there is nothing left and it’s us that will reap the consequences. Just look at how they are going to start drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Yes it’s useful for each of us to live a more sustainable lifestyle, but all of these climate change communication researchers focus on how to make the individual change their lifestyle rather than how to get the individual to recognize the issue with how our current capitalist society functions and researching what can lead the individual to go protest.

Sure, we can and should reduce electricity consumption, but a more important question is maybe: how can we convince companies and goverments to switch to renewable energy? Solar & wind energy is already significantly cheaper than burning coal. \n\nHowever, going back to my first point, our BIGGEST problem is: what do we do with the other 80% of energy use? The use of fossil fuels is embedded in the way we move people and stuff (cars, airplanes, container ships), the things we eat (meat production is a huge contributor to climate change) and the products we use (plastics, concrete or steel for example). For most of these things we still have no clue how to transform these systems to sustainable ones. \n\nWe need loads of research & development, and loads of people who are concious of the enormous challenge we're facing.

We started making policies and laws in regards to climate change early enough that the problem seemed relatively fixable in a shorter time period, plus we got kids onboard a short time after, teaching about the dangers and effects of climate change. And while there are a lot of bad stuff, Ice caps and glaciers melting and potentially putting the entire country underwater, and the threat of entire species dying, causing the ecosystem to fall apart. But all of that could be tied down to a single thing. Greenhouse gasses, primarily carbon dioxide of course, which would come from fossil fuels like those used in our cars and power plants. So we saw a way to change it there. If we could switch entirely to green energy consumption, we could potentially save us all from destruction! We already had a head start thanks to investing in wind power following the oil crisis, so that definitely helped make the problem more approachable!

It is an opportunity which the enterprising can certainly make the most of. India: Climate change is accompanied by unbearable pollution. Also there are the traffic woes leading to inordinate delays and road rage. So what is the solution? Small and tiny vehicles eg quadricycle cars running on solar powered electricity. Can't business lobby for the needed changes, eg recharging facilities? Or invest in these as a complementary economic good? \n\n\n\nCan we do without refrigerators? Yes some of us can, because we have home delivery of perishables everyday or we can pick up small quantities every day. This is especially true for retired persons who do not live far from shopping complexes. Its not that tough to change. As for animal agriculture...You don't have to eat cows pigs and goats you know! It is so very cruel. Have compassion and also improve your health. Remember we are not driven by instinct but by intelligence.

It already is, to the wavelengths that CO2 can absorb.  But it also re-emits, which means it is both \"black\" and \"white\" at the same time.  Its warming power is the latency between these; how long can it hold a photon of energy?   But most of the time near the surface it transfers the absorbed energy by collision with another molecule and consequently does not radiate.  This is an important factor in warming.  Conversely, at TOA (Top of Atmosphere), CO2 is free to radiate into space where other atmospheric molecules cannot.  The result is CO2 cools the TOA, but warms the BOA (surface).

Cleaner air never hurt anybody, burning fossil fuels does. Also, it's not just using fossil fuels, it's using single use products, especially plastic. Not only does it create tons of waste unable to break down for thousands of years, the process of making it causes carbon emissions, causing air pollution and, whether you believe it or not, climate change. It's not some theory. You want proof? Look at history. London smog. Every country that industrialized early went through the problem of air pollution, and now with regulation it has subsided.

Or we are going to implement these only on Western civilization and leave the rest as it is when China says ok for everything and on reality does nothing but promisses ?\nMy conciensce is clean, i travel by car only when i real need to use it, i like to walk , i dont put trash on the streets and i clean the places i use everywhere .

There are far too many highly complex disciplines and unpredictable parameters that effect climate, to be an expert or predict future levels, (as all the dubious computer models have failed to do). As a scientist myself (organic chemistry and biochemistry), I deal in empirical data. As such, I 'd say I'm not an expert but a climate \"realist\". \r\nI'm not chasing NGO, NASA, or institutional funding to pursue such career, so I dont create a problem, fudge data or propose a solution. To expect \"global average\" temperature to NOT rise or fall by 1 degree or sea levels by one cm or two over 100years is farcical!! That's assuming we can even measure such parameters accurately or meaningfully. Tide gauges for example, are subject to gravity and land movement etc. \r\nEarth's temperature varies between ~ -50C and +60C depending on season, altitude, latitude, sunspot activity, atmospheric moisture, undersea volcanoes, ocean dipoles, tectonic plate movement, deforestation, urban island effects etc etc. Moreover, the \"average\" temperature makes little attempt to consider data error or confidence limits, irregular placement of thermometers and accuracy of past empirical data. What really annoys me is when I see a graph with the Y axis showing a range of 1 to 2 degrees. Any small variation will appear to the novice, as an alarming vertical rise when it would be a virtual straight line if the full range of temperatures being measured are expressed.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Gerry De naro", "channel": "UC6Jj_bNeDPyXW3F-Z3-jw2g", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQa3-kGvngpdYQJTMASUIoC5A1NIl47CxLpWtLwdw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Besides the CO2 produced by man made machines, there are over 7 billion people exhaling CO2 thousands of times per day. There are also billions upon billions of animals that exhaling CO2. There are also natural phenomenons such as volcanoes that release CO2. There is also the fact that CO2 is even the largest greenhouse gas. Water Vapor is. The reason that the condition of the world deteriorates is because of the Second Law of thermodynamics which says, “as one goes forward in time, the net entropy (degree of disorder) of any isolated or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same).” This means as time increases the conditions of any object or even the earth itself will either remain the same or decrease. It will never improve. For example: If you leave a truck sitting out in a field for several years it will rust and not work anymore. The same thing will happen to the earth which is why inevitably it will be destroyed no matter what we do about it.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Hawk Moth EAS", "channel": "UCHv1r2sHQSQn6hFqI8Ji4DA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/XeL0zwYs8ep5MJGFfB_j9gRj31NhCHVCrrfVpiA_kJwyTGu1XHoUVIpiMwUoc1ThfQOHxgtiCw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Weather can vary in the short term, whereas climate is a gradual trend.

It does mean that those super cold days will gradually happen less and less and winters will grow more mild, and the heat of summer will kick in sooner. \n\nAlso, natural disasters caused by weather will be more common. Look at 2020- California’s wildfire season has caused two catastrophes, one of which is still going on, Australia had a huge problem with wildfires, the Gulf Coast has been hit with two hurricanes and a tropical storm already this season, with so many storm systems forming that the Weather Service ran out of letters to name them with and had to resort to the Greek alphabet.\n\nHope this helps, even if you don’t see it!", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Morgan Faye", "channel": "UCvyIiXgT2s0E-rEoX-usXkQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSlTFYQnHUXOP8lYFjqq1zWnuC1epuWCh6HBrEwiA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyyrnGiSBX8x6qAt0F4AaABAg", "text": "I'm not downplaying the potential seriousness of drastic climate change, BUT one thing the video fails to mention after drawing a direct comparison to the ozone \"crisis\". First, chlorofluorocarbons were scientifically proven to be the direct cause of destruction of ozone when radiation breaks up CFCs causing them to release chlorine atoms that steal an oxygen atom from ozone to form chlorine monoxide. This was not a \"scientific consensus\", this was an empirically proven scientific _fact_. The fact is climate change is another beast entirely. We cannot prove with empirical data the exact cause-and-effect of carbon emissions on the climate model. Therefore, there is a scientific _consensus_. A consensus isn't fact, it's an agreement on an opinion.There's no data that suggests if all carbon emissions suddenly stop the climate will begin to cool. The climate has fluctuated for millions of years without our help. Is carbon emissions a bad thing for the planet? Absolutely. Pollution of any kind is not a great thing. But facts are facts, and we cannot prove with a high confidence % that X directly causes Y in terms of planetary climate. The scale is too massive, and the effort required on a global, multi-national scale to even make a measurable impact in atmospheric carbon levels is so high and expensive it just isn't feasible.

They also have one of the highest starvation rates in the world. Poor example to support your claim. In addition, if we stopped feeding livestock all the food and crops that we do currently, and instead feed the people. Well I guess, with your idea, we will all just be eating grass and hay. Because that's literally the primary food source for livestock. I don't think you understand the idea behind multiplying food amount. You get things like grass, that humans simply can't consume and get nutrients from because our bodies can't break the cell walls of grass. Then you feed them to animals that can eat the grass, then proceed to harvest them. It's a rather simple idea. The world will not reduce hunger rates by reducing livestock amount, in fact doing that, will result in the complete opposite.

{"cid": "Ugx5TxkOa3RdWGDAN2x4AaABAg", "text": "Ironically because of American policies and climate change no matter what they do those without melanin won't be able to thrive in a climate changed world according to a Norwegian study by researchers Gine Roll Skjærvø, Frode Fossøy, and Eivin Røskaft  as the climate gets hotter white/Asian birth rates and life expectancy will continue to lower and they will have to migrate north or go into caves the same way their ancestors did 8000 years ago! For those without Eumelanin (Black brown skin) the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region makes their health weaken as the area is susceptible to some of the more severe consequences of global warming, including lethal heat waves, extensive drought and rising sea levels.Researchers at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia have found that the region – already incredibly hot in the summer – could become so warm that \"human habitability is compromised.\" temperatures could reach dangerous levels for human survivability.for caucasians the threshold is 35 degrees centigrade, for people without melanin's protection against UV radiation this only applies for the most able-bodied people. This means that white people with health problems, children and the elderly have a lower threshold for survivability.The clock is already ticking for those without melanin which is why scientists are spending millions trying to develop artificial melanin for those that can afford it.WHY?...Because global warming is melting the polar icecaps and melting the frozen soil beneath. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.ALL people have melanin, with the exception of albinos - they have genetic mutation that does not allow for melanin synthesis.The difference is the type of melanin produced, mainly eumelanin and pheomelanin. There is also neuromelonin, but this doesn’t show up in physical appearance.\nEumelanin is what constitutes for brown pigments. Dark hair, brown eyes, tan or black skin. That’s the expression of eumelanin, and probably the type of melanin you are most familiar with.\nPheomelanin is what constitutes pink pigments. Red hair, light eyes, pasty and red-hued skin is the expression of a higher presence of pheomelanin. This is more common in people of Caucasian descent.Eumelanin has specific advantages as it is the norm for humans. black skin may enhance the body’s natural immune system and provide better protection against disease than white skin (Mackintosh, 2001). The melanin in dark skin is believed to help enhance the body’s natural ability to combat pathogens (Nosanchuk and Casadevall, 2006; Mackintosh, 2001; Manning et al, 2003).Eumelanin has also been implicated in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis (mechanism by which the body maintains adequate calcium levels) known to be involved with calcium ion regulation in the inner ear, which may improve hearing (Furuta et al, 1998; Norris et al, 2005; Nosanchuk and Casadevall 2003, 2006; William, 2007).melanin as it relates to hearing has also found that skin pigmentation reduces the effects of noise-induced temporary hearing loss. For example, empirical studies have shown that people with more skin pigmentation suffer significantly less temporary hearing loss than those with pale skin (Barrenäs and Lindgren, 1990; Maurer et al, 1999). In addition to this, melanin offers resistance to heat or cold, as well as resistance to the activity of inorganic antimicrobial compounds (Garcia-Rivera and Casadevall, 2001; Rosas and Casadevall, 1997) thus improving natural overall health. Which is why people believe tanning makes you appear healthier!darkly pigmented skin is at substantially lower risk of developing skin cancer than is fair skin (Agar and Young, 2005). In the U.S., Also some forms of skin cancer are “50 times” higher in Caucasians than in African Americans, and African Americans have a 13-fold lower incidence of melanoma than do Caucasians (Tadokoro et al, 2003). Melanin also acts as a free radical scavenger and has been shown to protect against Cryptococcus neoformans; this is a parasite of the central nervous system (Curie & Casadevall, 1994; Mitchell & Perfect, 1995). Interestingly, it is known that Caucasians suffer from heightened rates of many diseases that affect the central nervous system. For example, Huntington’s disease, optic neuritis, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, PKU (Phenylketonuria), Anencephaly and Spinal bifida (Bates et al, 2002; Okano et al, 1990; Tanner et al, 1996; Nelson et al, 1997; Modi et at, 2001; Kurtzke, 1979; Alan, 2003). While there may not be any ‘direct’ relationship between melanin levels and these particular neurodegenerative conditions, it should be noted that (eu)melanin is believed to protect folate and folic acid (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000; Branda and Eaton, 1978). These are essential vitamins that are particularly important for neural tube development in the unborn (Vorobey et al, 2006; Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000). Depleted levels of these vitamins are caused by UV light exposure (Vorobey et al, 2006; Lapunzina, 2006; Branda and Eaton, 1978), which Caucasians are particularly susceptible (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000). Depleted levels of these vitamins have been linked to a variety of different birth defects including ‘spinal bifida’ and ‘anencephaly’ (brain malformation). Research has also shown that melanin is actually not a sunscreen ,  against UVB radiation but absorbs and utilizes it (Mackintosh, 2001; Hill, 1992; Scheibner et al., 1986).In fact the study of melanin was the basis for breakthroughs in computer science!Lighter skin has less melanin and what is produced is typically found arranged in clusters of melanosomes in keratinocytes, while darker skin has more melanin and the melanosomes are distributed individually in keratinocytes, thus absorbing light more efficiently (Miyamura, 2006).\nCaucasian people, while producing overall lower levels of melanin (Tadokoro et al., 2003; Miyamura, 2006), have also been shown to possess higher concentrations of a more deleterious form of melanin known as “Pheomelanin.” The kind of melanin that helps to cause blonde and red hair (blue and green eyes) also increases the potential for cell death! Pheomelanin filters out UV radiation, but it also increases UV harmful effects and causes cell death, particularly when the melanin is the kind found in light hair or skin (Brash et al., 2004; Maresca, 2006). Melanin plays important roles in vision. Norris et al (2005) show that melanin acts like a neutralizing sponge inside cells in the retina to soak up and destroy reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, which are energized by light, are thought to play a major role in “macular degeneration”, the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60. The disorder is more prevalent among whites than among African-Americans (Evans, 2003; Norris et al, 2005; Klein et al, 1999).

Individual competitions among single citizens may be a grassroots motivation, but the real damage comes from our industries, our products, our materials. There needs to be a greater push to ramp up fuel economy, and rid ourselves of dependency on oil. That means, no gasoline, no plastics, and less fresh water consumption. \nI have made a commitment to myself to rid my household of unnecessary plastics. Once a bottle is emptied, I will actively search out eco-friendlier solutions, with better packaging, and less harmful chemicals. It's easy to turn down grocery bags, and plastic razors, disposable cutlery and dishes, and other items that use low grade plastics. I won't use takeout containers unless they're made from recycled fibers. I'm investigating my city's recycling program, and seeing what forms of waste are predominantly making up our landfills. My plan is to get involved with the city council to start asking businesses to invest in biodegradable options for packaging and products to help eliminate waste. Our disposable items are some of the worst designed products imaginable, in terms of material waste to produce them, and the amount of waste involved in throwing them away.\nI know people out there think that this is alarmist, and we are putting undue economic pressure on industries to compete for energy conservation and carbon capture, but the way I see it, it's essential to revolutionize our energy sources and infrastructure. It's like having someone argue for the candlestick industry in the age of the incandescent bulb. Why wouldn't we want to upgrade?!

Because the age determined by the carbon-14 method may be appreciably different from the true age in certain cases, it is customary to refer to such dates in “radiocarbon years.” These dates, obtained from a variety of deposits, form an important framework for Holocene stratigraphy and chronology.\n\nThe limitations of accuracy of radiocarbon age determinations are expressed as ± a few tens or hundreds of years. In addition to this calculated error, there also is a question of error due to contamination of the material measured. For instance, an ancient peat may contain some younger roots and thus give a falsely “young” age unless it is carefully collected and treated to remove contaminants. Marine shells consist of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and in certain coastal regions there is upwelling of deep oceanic water that can be 500 to more than 1,000 years old. An “age” from living shells in such an area can suggest that they are already hundreds of years old.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Crystal Giddens", "channel": "UCTjk-MZHD7rsUMBgx29GTSg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkocKnR3ggmjYKXGttS9w_KYtmfMc6e9YlQuIjRQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

First lets change the current definition used in this video of Climate change, to actual climate change, not world temperature change. Climate change refers to a climate, a specific area of the world, and it's condition. This definition of climate change is the one we will suppose is correct, which it is, and going by this, I agree climate change is real, the climate of different parts of the world is constantly changing. However, Earth's overall climate has always warmed and cooled, and the 20th century rise in global temperature is within the bounds of natural temperature fluctuations over the past 3,000 years. Although the planet has warmed 1-1.4°F over the 20th century, it is within the +/- 5°F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics found that \"many records reveal that the 20th century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium.\" A 2005 study published in Nature found that \"high temperatures - similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990 - occurred around AD 1000 to 1100\" in the Northern Hemisphere. A 2013 study published in Boreas found that summer temperatures during the Roman Empire and Medieval periods were \"consistently higher\" than temperatures during the 20th century. According to a 2010 study in the Chinese Science Bulletin, the recent global warming period of the 20th century is the result of a natural 21-year temperature oscillation, and will give way to a \"new cool period in the 2030s. \n\n\"I'm referring to people that have died that wouldn't have otherwise... specifically I'm thinking of extreme heatwaves - that have killed thousands - that can be attributed to human-caused global warming.\"\n\nThis point is irrelevant as it has to do with climate change, not world temperature change. Evidence suggests that this was a natural occurrence, and has happened since 1000 B.C. at least.\n\n\n\"Your Ice Age comment (presumably intending the Little Ice Age) is irrelevant... which you'd understand, if you understood this issue. But you don't, so the rational course of action for you is to silently and humbly heed the findings of the climate scientists.\"\n\nGoing by your prior statement as to the comment referring to the ice age I had written, I can conclude that you have some knowledge as to why my statement was \"irrelevant\" Would you be kind enough to share this?\nSimple faculty and logic would conclude that, when coming out of an ice age, the temperature levels would rise as a direct result of the implied ice.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Brendi", "channel": "UC6Y0pOpwNY-HEVMlnULwVfg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRPjQYQLCzHqLeCB4JKhBAN9XKKB4Y4GMwFwCYFug=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But today many of those structures and ruins are inland, out in the open, making them popular tourist destinations. How did that happen? The Little Ice Age once again turned substantial ocean water into ice, lowering sea levels, and leaving former ports stranded. Not enough ice has melted since 1850 to make them harbors again.\nThe ancient city of Ephesus was an important port city and commercial hub from the Bronze Age to the Minoan Warm period, and continuing through the Roman Empire. An historic map shows its location right on the sea. But today, in modern-day Turkey, Ephesus is 5 km from the Mediterranean. Some historians erroneously claim “river silting” caused the change, but the real “culprit” was sea level change.\nRuins of the old Roman port Ostia Antica, are extremely well preserved – with intact frescoes, maps and plans. Maps from the time show the port located at the mouth of the Tiber River, where it emptied into the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Battle of Ostia in 849, depicted in a painting attributed to Raphael, shows sea level high enough for warships to assemble at the mouth of the Tiber. However, today this modern-day tourist destination is two miles up-river from the mouth of the Tiber.

I know this to be bad temper, immaturity, poor manners, and poor communication skills - or a combination of all of the above.

Your criticisms of sites seem to lean hard in the political/economics realm rather than actual science rebuttal. I am not convinced of a lack of global warming so much as I am convinced that there is a too much political involvement/corruption/simplification involved with the IPCC, its science, political sponsors, and its recommendations. \n\nYou seem to fall right in line with that as well, in feeling that business or privately funded science should be completely disregarded because of potential funding motives i.e. Scientists can be bought. But you also believe that politically funded science is unquestionably credible--- because politicians are pure of heart? and never have power of profit motive to influence outcome? Or Scientists working on the government payroll are special somehow and can't be bought? I like watching Judith Curry's discussions on climate change, she seems remarkably balanced to me.\n\nScience is weird like this. Everybody can believe a theory. Accept it as fact. But let one piece of data not fit, and the theory is so much trash on the road. Errors in data collection, erratic data collection, falsification of data, collusion to manipulate data sets, and ineffective modeling all remain what they are. All of these problems have very publically plagued the IPCC in the last 10 or 15 years. And yet the political drive is to upturn the world economy in a stampede of fear over what might happen.\n\nWhat I know is that the IPCC uses a number of models which diverge from eachother radically.

Buying new energy efficient appliances literally does nothing for the environment.  I hate to be the one to explain this but there's not a guy shoveling coal that's going to stop shoveling and take a break because you're using less electricity.  Seriously though, the high voltage lines coming to a home has a regulated amount of power passing through those lines.  If you completely discover the power from a house the exact same amount of power is passing through the power line.  The transformer just produces more heat.  The electrical grid has to work this way or there wouldn't be a constant and consistent power which modern electronics require.  Explaining it another way would be  the power coming into a home is kept constant regardless of the power usage of the neighboring homes.  The power does but fluctuate because of the usage of any other used of the power line.  This is regulated by the transformer.  All the but new energy efficient... save the planet stuff it's great a marketing plow to get consumers to buy new stuff.  Energy efficiency does save the homeowner miniscule amounts of money but that's all the good you can do from buying new more energy efficient appliances.

Buying new energy efficient appliances literally does nothing for the environment.  I hate to be the one to explain this but there's not a guy shoveling coal that's going to stop shoveling and take a break because you're using less electricity.  Seriously though, the high voltage lines coming to a home has a regulated amount of power passing through those lines.  If you completely disconnect the load of a house the exact same amount of power is passing through the power line.  The transformer just produces more heat.  The electrical grid has to work this way or there wouldn't be constant and consistent power which modern electronics require.  Explaining it another way would be  the power coming into a home is kept constant regardless of the power usage of the neighboring homes.  The power does but fluctuate because of the usage of lack of usage of any other consumer of the power line.  This is regulated by the transformer.  All the buy new energy efficient... save the planet stuff is just a marketing ploy to get consumers to buy new stuff.  Energy efficiency does save the homeowner miniscule amounts of money but that's all the good you can do from buying new more energy efficient appliances.  Sorry there a campaign to spread disinformation to the mass markets, but it is capitalism after all.  I told you the truth believe it or not.  If you want to believe there's a guy at the power station turning back a dial because you turned all your lights off go ahead.  Or you can find out yourself. Get a laser thermometer it better yet an infrared camera and look at the temperature of the transformer nearest to your home.  Then flip the master switch to your home and watch what happens to the temperature of the transformer.

{"cid": "Ugxz_r5qTDeLDAeei5V4AaABAg", "text": "I think a big problem is the scale as it relates to cost and benefits. No one individual, company, organisation, or even nation can do enough to make an appreciable difference to climate change. That means that making changes means sacrificing profits, competitiveness or standard of living for no gain. The problem can only be solved by everyone doing the right thing, but as long as not everyone is doing it, those that are will be disadvantaged compared to those that aren't. Nobody on the macros scale wants to make the first move because addressing climate change only penalises early adopters, with no tangible reward or payoff. Nobody on the micro scale wants to do anything because the results are so insignificant - what's the point of buying that expensive high efficiency washing machine to save a couple tons a year when the factory down the road is pumping out that much every second? As with many things, climate action require huge participation at every level of society to be effective, and either the benefits will be experienced by everyone regardless of participation, or they will not occur at all. That means there is no reason for individual entities to participate beyond altruism, unless forced to or coerced by legislation or artificial economies like carbon trading/taxation.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "lancer D", "channel": "UCMd5AutoY8pvgh-OP_0wwWw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSsacwZDKM0_3r2Wo-m_N7LsBKLpXtrag3tK7douw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Simple and in your hands.\n\nIf it had not been for “deniers” challenging the “consensus” doctors and surgeons would still be going from patient to patient with infectious hands and clothing.\nHere’s an excellent example of fake news.\n\n“97% of scientists (implying ALL!!! scientists) believe in man-caused climate change.”\n \nWhat the MSM meant to say is 97% of all CLIMATE scientists (similar to aroma-therapists and horse whisperers) actively researching and publishing in that field (At this point insert getting paid.) consider the evidence compelling - all 82 of them – cherry picked out of the 10,500 surveys that were sent out.

Of which farms still emit much of.   And other feedbacks: https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/taller-plants-warming-arctic-could-speed-climate-change\n\nCO2 targets are not being reached: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html  and a rise in right-wing \"pro-economy\" ideals and nationalism may destroy any liberal progress on the matter.   Right wing US president Donald Trump already fights to deregulate and undo climate progress. \n\nAnd even IF Carbon was constrained, 77% of all energy would still come from Fossil Fuels. \n\ni am one of little faith.   \n\nPlant CO2 absorption rates will likely drop again, the heat forces plants to close their stomata for longer to prevent moisture loss. \n\nAnd one must remember that projections tend to end at 2100. \n\nThe Great dying is being recreated ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinction-report-the-great-dying ) it was caused by a massive disruption to the carbon cycle via extreme hyper-volcanism and the ignition of internal coal and methane deposits as a result.

There are other greenhouse gases we are emitting.   \n\nAnd anyways, CO2 is not the only existential threat humanity has, Overpopulation, Deforestation and animal equivalent Defaunation, biodiversity erasure due to human expansion, Plastic production, pollution.  These and others are still very serious threats that rival climate change and make the sixth extinction more certain. \n \nPeople are already noting the incredibly loss in biodiversity that has occurred in the past decades.   Flying insects are vanishing https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/15/hyperalarming-study-shows-massive-insect-loss/ \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html\n\nRoads and other human infrastructure are dividing and destroying animal habitat reducing populations significantly.   https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/15/new-map-reveals-shattering-effect-of-roads-on-nature \n\nhttps://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Threats-to-Wildlife/Habitat-Loss\n\nThe Anthropocene age is a world unrecognizable to nature. Completely alien, dominated by a \"superpredator\" (official term) a single freak of nature species rapidly evolved from a freak environment, as an evolutionary dead end.  \n\n(https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/dec/29/evolution.science )\n\n   A world transformed, a world dying. Nothing like this has happened since the first photosynthetic appeared and destroyed earth with Oxygen in the early days of life.   And Civilization is at fault, it consumes endlessly. And everyone wants it, Worldwide.   It requires infinite resources from a finite planet. It is inherently unsustainable.   It's it or us.   And that is why I lack hope.  Because Civilization is great!   It saves lives, it entertains.  It tastes great and glitters. \n\nSo, It's the end of the world as we know it~  And I feel fine~ (this song sums up my view pretty well) \n\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmB3lRjCmc )\n\nI know this conversation is just about climate change, but I decided to add those other threats to help you understand my viewpoint. \n\nThis blog can help too:  https://collapseofindustrialcivilization.com/", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Fandom guy", "channel": "UC8DJA1JgDwBg6p8jL2MT9MQ", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRsdMM1e2Nudzz3MdKRAcsjXeUXPq0HUDscjiPJHg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They are not precise with their statements. Yes, the climate is changing, but it is definitely not heading in a catastrophic direction at all. The earth has\n experienced countless periods of warming and cooling, and it is a shame that the leftist media are trying to persuade people about a problem that no well-educated person takes seriously. \n\n     To give \nhistorical evidence, in the Roman times, the climate was even warmer than it is today (then it gradually cooled down), and it was at least as hot towards the end of the dark ages. Up until now, it is concluded \nthat global warming is not happening to the magnitude that Bill Nye and \nNeil deGrasse Tyson says it is. We are still technically in an ice age \n(known as the Pleistocene Ice age, that has been going on since 440,000BC) and the glaciers are still around eroding the landscape. Before this period, the ice caps were nonexistent. (According to Paleontologists)  \n\n\n     Furthermore, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (since the 1850s) \nhas been shown to not be correlated to the average temperature of \nearth's climate. And it was only a few decades ago that people actually \nstarted to take into account that the earth is warming up. The earth's \ntemperature only increases 1.5C every century, not identical to the \nfigures that professional organizations warned us about. Not only is the\n data confirming global warming not taken with serious intent, but it \nhas been confirmed that the climate change researchers tampered with the\n data, a fraud move that makes their rationale appear much less \nattractive.\n\n     If you told me climate change is real, I would \nask, \"How much of that climate change is done by humans?\" or \"Under \nwhich studies confirmed this to be true?\".

What do you think the \"CC\" in \"IPCC\" stands for? The use of the term \"climate change\" has nothing to do with some evasion by scientists. Instead, \"climate change\" refers to a broader category of phenomena, that includes global warming. So global warming is a type of climate change, just like canines are a type of mammal. And just like biologists can use terms like \"canine\" and \"mammal\" without it being a conspiracy, climate scientists can use terms like \"climate change\" and \"global warming\" without it being a conspiracy. This is all easily researchable.\n\n\"Polluted Discourse: Communication and Myths in a Climate of Denial\n[...]\nOur results indicate that “climate change” has been used more often than global warming in the scientific literature and continues to be the more prevalent term in recent years. There also appears to be no relationship between the greater use of the term “global warming” (relative to climate change ) and higher temperatures. [...] Our analysis therefore leads us to conclude that the claim that the term global warming was abandoned in favor of the term climate change, in response to stalling temperature, is baseless.\"\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20161-0_3\n\n\n\n\"The climate does in fact change.

Why wouldn't they show information from long before the industrial revolution to emphasize the fact that that is in fact what is causing this? But if you look back at records from long before 1850, they'll show that the earth has constantly undergone time periods of extreme heat and extreme cold.

GHG VOLUME (%): The atmospheric GHG proportionality of CO2 is 76% and for CH4 it is 16% (average highs). Hence, there is 4.75x more CO2 molecules in the atmosphere as CH4. We agreed here also…\n\n3.) GHG VOLUME (PPM): I found that these percent ratios are perhaps misleading, so I tried parts-per notation. CO2 is 400ppm and CH4 is 1.8ppm… This suggests there is ~222x more CO2 in the atmosphere than CH4. Hence the \"4.75\" we BOTH calculated is perhaps useless. \n\n3.)

I don't know why you divided 36/85 (i.e. 20 yr CH4 GWP / 100 yr)… In combining GHG volume with the GWP on a 20 year horizon, we don't care about the 100 yr CH4 GWP figure.\n\nTWO QUESTIONS:\n• computing for anthropogenic contribution vs. natural (e.g. 97% of TA CO2 is nature made, methane is lower?)\n• Any comment on Nitrous Oxide?", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "aeopmusic", "channel": "UC4U2Qe5kxrAhINQpBeLvhoA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS30o5ZtWvTFtEt8NEtfX6inAd2gMIcOoMyFBngQw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you live an active lifestyle, are an athlete (pro or amateur), crossfitter, bodybuilder, labourer, soldier, fireman, fitness enthusiast, whatever, your protein demands are going to be much higher along with your caloric needs, potentially 1.5g or higher per kilo. To suggest that one size fits all is ignorant. \nThere are indeed plant based foods high in protein. But I'm sure none of them are as cheap and calorie-efficient as meat. If you can tell me a plant based food that contains 25g of protein per 100g for less than 280 calories (no overpriced supplements), I'll be impressed. If you can give me a plant-based source of protein that meets the above criteria and is as affordable as meat, I'll turn vegan right now.

You said you can get all your protein from plant based sources, I explained why that is far from ideal. You said you only need a certain amount of protein, I explained why that isn't true. Not sure what you're confused about.\nPretty much every foodstuff contains protein. How much protein they contain in relation to other macronutrients is a whole other consideration.\nAs for supplements, they exist for one purpose, to contain as much protein as possible for as few calories as possible and to be as palatable as possible, hence why bodybuilders use them. I.e. people who can't be bothered to get protein from other sources. They don't contain the micronutrients that can be found in whole foods, yet they often cost more. What's so great about that?\nAs I said previously, one size doesn't fit all. What if someone is on a 2500 calorie diet but requires 180g of protein a day to support their level of physical activity? Are you suggesting they rely on supplements Mr Healthy? If we're talking about normal 9-5 normies who don't partake in strenuous physical activity, a vegan diet is more realistic. Not everyone is a 9-5 office working normie though. Again, veganism is far from ideal. Meat is great. A cheap source of protein and a nutritional power-house. Whey and Soy-isolate? Not so much lol.

These animals use up land that may have once been a forest and they require more land to feed them. Now certain animals are worse than others, especially cows. Per 1kg of meat, a cow requires 20 times more area of land compared to a chicken (both for food and physical space combines) and they produce far more GHGs per kg than any other animal.

Not only would massively reducing dependence on oil eliminate the cost of military conflicts in the middle east, but it would also save the lives of thousands of American soldiers, save the lives of millions in the middle east, save the lives of tens of thousands of people who die as a result of air pollution in the US, and it would eliminate a major source of funding for terrorist groups.\n\nA global sea wall is FAR from being a realistic solution, and it wont do anything to stop the mass extinction event that has already begun... which is very likely to take the vast majority of the human race with it. \n\nWhen combined with storage, solar and wind can supply a huge portion of our electricity, and that electricity  can be used to power just about everything, from our cars, to heat pumps for our homes, to industrial processes.

{"cid": "UgggOtTvr_ghP3gCoAEC.8R_qTZCe66C8uhqqakFJxw", "text": " @Lauren Perdulla  why would he be joking? People dont want to just not eat meat but give up these common things. Here's an article from beef2live\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the word \"beef\"?\nPerhaps, meat, hamburger, steak or even leather. These are all products of the beef animal (or cattle), but there are also many other byproducts.\nBeef byproducts are the products that we get from beef cattle that might not be quite so obvious. For example, soap is a beef byproduct because it uses beef fat.\nIf you have a beef animal that weigh 1,000 pounds – 640 pounds of the animal will be used for meat products, such as steak, roasts and hamburgers. This means 64% of the animal is used for meat. However, 99% of the cow is utilized for meat and other products.\nFrom 1 cow hide you can get 12 basketballs OR 144 baseballs OR 20 footballs OR 18 volleyballs OR 18 soccer balls OR 12 baseball gloves.\nIf you strung 1 year’s worth of hotdogs – end to end – around the world, you would go around the world 16 times!\nLeather is a very good example of a beef byproduct.  It is made from the cow hide and it is used to make byproducts. Byproducts are a product of the animal that is used as an \"ingredient\" in other products.\nThere are many foods that are obviously byproducts, such as steak, roasts and hamburgers. Another more obvious product is milk and other dairy products, such as butterand yogurt.\nName some food products that come from animals. Meat, beef, beef jerky, hotdogs, lamb chops. These are all direct example of food products, but they may be used in tv dinners and lunchmeats.\nDid you know that gelatin, what Jello is made from, comes from the connective tissues of the beef animal. So when you eat Jello, you are actually eating an animal byproduct.\nOther products that contain gelatin might include gum, fruit snacks like gummy bears, and marshmallows.\nMany medical products are made from animal byproducts. Some products may contain stearic acid that is found in fatty acids, such as in beef cattle. Ointments for burns and first aid creams may contain animal byproducts.\nAntirejection drugs are used when someone has a heart transplant, liver transplant or even a ligament in your knee to help the body accept the new organ. Animals, such as beef, sheep and swine have remarkable similarities to our own bodies.\nInsulin is utilized by diabetics. It can be synthetic, which means that is man-made, but it also can come from livestock.\nThere is a sticky part on the bandages that can be made from animal fatty acids since fatty acids are used to make adhesives.\nHousehold and office products also may contain beef byproducts. Dog food might include chicken, beef or pork byproducts. Rawhide bones that dogs chew on are made from animal hides.\nLaundry pre-treatments contains enzymes – a protein found in cattle and sheep.\nThere is a certain kind of china that knick knacks may be made out of that can be made from an animal byproduct – bone china. Bone china is made from the bones.\nThere may be fatty acids from cattle or other animals added to toilet paper to make it soft.\nWhat’s on the label of the glue bottle? There is a cow on the label of glue because you can use a cow’s hooves and horns to make glue.\nDish soap may contain beef fat that helps make your hands soft.\nEven film contains the beef product – gelatin - on the coating of the film.\nCandles may have beef byproducts in them to give them more strength, to help them last longer, and make them more opulent.\nWhat would crayons have in them? Probably beef fat, but there is also a kind out now that is made from soybeans.\nPaintbrushes can be made out of horse hair, but can be made out of the hairs from other animals as well.\nSports equipment is often made from animal byproducts. Many professional teams use cowhide footballs. So not all footballs are made of pigskin like many people think. Footballs can be made out of both pig skin and beef skin.\nVolleyballs can be made from leather, and so can the baseball glove and the outer covering of the baseball.\nIndustrial use – many lubricants and fluids may contain beef fats. Some inks used in printing contain animal fats. High gloss printing might contain animal fats.\nIndustrial cleaners may also include beef byproducts.\nGrooming – Nail polish remover contain gelatin that helps give your nails strength. Soap, lotions, makeup and lipstick may contain stearic acid, a fatty acid. But not all of them do – as some people are allergic to animal byproducts. Some also contain lanolin which is a sheep byproduct. Shaving cream also contains stearic acid, a fatty acid.\nMany deodorants contains fatty acids. When people clean their contacts, they use little white tablets called enzymatic cleaners. Enzymes are a protein found in animals.\nSaddle soap is used on leather shoes and any type of leather product. It helps leather items maintain softness.\nTravel and transportation. Antifreeze may contain glycerol, an animal byproduct. Hydraulic brake fluid and car wax also may contain animal byproducts.   Highways are made of asphalt and contain a binding agent made from beef byproducts.\nTires contain stearic acid which helps tires maintain their elasticity.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Brandon Sanchez", "channel": "UClAvZzz9Eq0AcJ4gZ8xHQAg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTpaxEb267oG_XyKJmzH8z7DbxES1_zmTfD=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture.

No 'scientists' were there to see it or record it. The ice cores  from Antarctica show clearly that aside from periodic 100, 500 and 1000 year variations  weather remains fairly constant. We also don't live long enough to see any real abnormalities on a personal level. The Media is responsible for painting a false picture using CGI and journalistic sensationalism to get people all worked up emotionally. As for HAARP, there is no direct proof but if you take time to study the claims from 'insiders' this technology is not being used for friendly purposes. It is a weapon being used by the Russians, USA and i believe China also to create earthquakes, storms and strange weather anomalies. Maybe even fake UFO phenomenon. Take some time to research the facts and your eyes will pop out at the lies and deception the people of the world have been and are being subjected to by a group of viciously nasty people who hate humanity. Al Gore's already been debunked as a liar and fear-monger who has made $100's of millions of dollars from the fake \"global warming' industry.

It is designed to promote anthropogenic global warming, it goes as far to make a ridiculous claim and compare arsenic to CO2.\n\nPlease read\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/283345743_Planetary_orbits'_effect_to_the_Northern_Hemisphere_climate_from_solar_corona_formation_to_the_Earth_climate\n\nPlease read\n\nhttp://amp.dailycaller.com/2015/03/11/study-earths-orbit-causes-global-warming-today-and-climate-change-1-4-billion-years-ago/", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "questioneverything2", "channel": "UC8c3QfyqLSmaXL9cvA-2lOA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSzqGefM06ucjXy263qyOW3BLg4wKstb_acaR_z=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Before the industrial revolution. No transport, no communication. At this point we've gone too far, and that's the only thing that would help anything. Using hair spray that will rise the temperature by 0.0^200000% in the next year, isn't going to do much. We need to find a source of energy that is as powerful as carbon based energy sources. Now, don't say solar, because the government in the US has invested billions and billions of dollars in getting these, yet only 4% of the US's energy is from solar power, even after billions of dollars later. Humans deal with things, it's what we do. People think that sea level is going to wipe out humanity. It's not. Move in land 5 miles and you're fine. Would you rather sell your coastal house for a low price, or go back to the 1850s? That's what i thought. Furthermore, it's not like the climate hasn't changed before. Throughout history climate has risen, and fallen. Global warming, and global cooling. Why do you think the ice age happened? And from research, it's shown that global warming would be more beneficial to humans than global cooling.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Adrian", "channel": "UC1-F4IMOIe0s0pbW5m-pw3Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRjeexAkm8kaROJNp-0b5u_svDUPQaVTQFJaPKgQQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We humans have lost a lot of our natural instincts, we've grown to become too emotionally attached and deeply fear the experience of the emotions of loss.\n\nLesser species have no choice, they can't build sophisticated technology so they have to adapt to their environment in order to survive; survival of the fittest. \n\nUs humans however are emotionally compelled to hold on to the things we've got because we do have a choice, we can build sophisticated technologies. So instead of adapting as a species to fit the environment, we now try to adapt the environment to fit us as a species. And that's where the logic has gone wrong.\n\nClimate change on earth is nothing new, it has wiped out hundreds of trillions of life forms, both land and water, and that's totally normal, it's not an evil sin.\n\nWe are only here now because somewhere down the line a sub species of ours perished while we continued to live on, so we owe it to our selves to thank climate change for wiping out our brothers and sisters, and allowing us to live successfully in this climate, we owe it gratitude.\n\nSo at what point do we say to our selves that climate change is a bad thing? Climate change is a psychological issue, not a scientific one. Humans have just becomes too sentimental and afraid to let go of things that have ran their course.\n\nYou know, the ice caps might melt and we might lose polar bears, but the rise in sea levels might make rivers in Africa run with gold and solve drout completely providing water and rich farm lands, saving millions of human lives.

Awareness of that fact is simultaneously encouraging and discouraging, because on one hand, by reducing our consumption of meat, especially beef, we can each do our part in redcing our \"carbon footprint.\"  Eating less animal meat (or hardly any at all or even none at all) is not only good for the environment, it's good for our bodies. But then, I LOVE the occasional steak, you know? I LOVE chicken and pork and lamb and fish , and frankly, I'm not keen on giving those things up entirely.\n\nWhat's discouraging (besides having to reduce or eliminate all animal meat) is the fact that it's going to be extremely difficult to get a majority of humans to change their eating habits. It's easy enough to buy a car that's fuel-efficient or a fridge that has a great Energy Star rating, but quite another to get people around the world to reduce meat consumption by 90% or 75% or even 50%. And let's not kid ourselves, the meat industry is not going to go quietly into the night. They're going to kick and scream and create adds that will create doubt about meat and its effect on the atmosphere, just as the oil companies do with regards to climate change itself. \n\nIt's going to be a tough road to hoe. But I'm glad you brought it up.

Chemistry really comes alive once you get to Organic chemistry and beyond to Quantum, Physical, Inorganic, and Analytical. Be sure to get a good grasp on molecular orbital theory and periodic trends, and don't worry about memorizing the table or atomic numbers of all of the elements. When you get to college I'd recommend taking a major in either Chemical Engineering/Bioengineering, or one of the subsets of chemistry/biochemistry. You can also go for a general chemistry major, but be aware that you won't go into some of the topics with as much specificity. \n\nFor now, check out this page, know how to assign charges to molecules using formal charge, get to know how to write electron configurations, and get a good grasp on stoichiometry. The rate laws and molecular kinetics will come in college or AP chemistry if you decide to take it (highly recommended - you'll be able to move right to organic once you graduate), and they involve some calculus.\n\nFirst go here: http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/atomorbs.html\n\nThen here: http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/vchemlib/course/mo_theory/\n\nI don't mean to overload you with information, but I sense that you have an interest in the subject, so I thought I might as well send you some useful links!

It is no longer called global warming because there are instances where certain areas of the world are actually colder or having more extreme winter weather.

As will Florida and other low laying coastal areas. California will be in a drought (which has officially ended but one deemed a cause of global warming) so don't live there either.

This seems to be the position of most scientists and ocean and atmosphere studying organizations.\n\n  As for the should we do anything or what should we do about it question, this is a political issue.\n\n I was a big fan of alternative energies but later on i discovered that they all have their flaws. No energy source is perfect.\n Fossil fuels are an amazing resource and people don't give due credit for their importance in the world we have today. It's just that we overused them. Wind and solar would be the best option to try and mitigate the reducing of use of fossil fuels but i fear it would not be enough to totally replace them. This would mean a change of habits and lifestyle especially in the transportation sector, but this dosn't seem politically, culturally and socially acceptable.\n\n So what do we get? Denial on one side, and on the other a belief that some magical solution is just around the corner \"free energy, thorium, etc..\" while everything stays basically the same. We will keep talking a lot about it, but real change won't come because it would be unconfortable even to the average \"global warming believer\".\n\n The serious predictions about climate change don't mean the end of the world or human extinction even if we burn all fossil fuel reserves, but they will mean that we won't be able to feed billions like in the world we have today. War, famine, disease , political unrest will drive civilization to it's knees before the climate stabilizes by around the 2300s. we will have a very different world. As for the fauna and flora they will suffer immensely because this is very different to the glacial/interglacial pattern of the neogene/quaternary epochs (the last 20 million years), add the other pressures made by humans with land use and chemical polution/deforestation and we get a very smaller range of animals and plants to live with.

Yes, the bad health effects are increased when you eat fast food, but that doesn't change the fact that meat still has those chemicals even when organic. I'm not going to go through the trouble of linking studies no one will read but, last time I checked, processing some broccoli doesn't increase my chances of getting colorectal cancer by 20 or so percent. This is also assuming 1. everyone can afford organic meats 2. the meat industry is going to have a sudden change of heart and change their farming practices so everyone can have safe meat and 3. that there is enough time and resources to be able to provide the world's demand of food with organic meat (spoiler alert: there isn't). It is also irresponsible to use billions of pounds of grain to feed animals so you can have burgers when you can instead feed the starving men, women, and children of the world. And yeah,  I agree nuclear is affordable and less dangerous, and yes cutting on coal and oil is nice, but that takes time, legislation, and a lot of capital that won't show up overnight.

{"cid": "UggscSCBSVBoN3gCoAEC.8RXvyQCM2bm8cCpHtzXMRs", "text": "+Mytheroo\n\n\"and this is why you fail. The argument is CATASTROPHIC ANTHROPOGENIC global warming (CAGW) has not been demonstrated sufficiently\"\n\nThat's just a straw man you contrarians use to misrepresent mainstream climate science, akin to how many creationists use the phrase \"molecules-to-man\" to misrepresent evolutionary biology:\n\nAnother claim advanced by those who reject the mainstream scientific agreement on climate is that the consensus position consists of a claim of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming or the frequently used acronym CAGW [...]. However, CAGW is rarely, if ever, defined or sourced to a mainstream scientific organization or study. Any scientific study’s result, or statement by a researcher, that does not fit a contrarian’s personal, flexible definition of CAGW can therefore be adopted as ostensibly supporting their view and refuting the mainstream, even when such results are actually consistent with the mainstream position on climate [...]. \n[...]\nAdditionally, we find that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a straw man used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50).\"\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20161-0_3\n\n\n\n\"The questions are do humans cause the bulk of this warming and is it catastrophic? The 97% consensus group were not asked that question.\"\n\nAgain, because that's a vague straw man you contrarians made up.\n\nThere's an evidence-based scientific consensus that:\n\nA1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century.\nA2) Humans [largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases] caused most of this recent warming.\nA3) Most of the recent [or near future] climate change is [or will be] caused by humans.\nA4) Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity.\n\nThe following sources document the consensus on A1 and A2:\n\nTable 1: \"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\"Does it matter if the consensus on anthropogenic global warming is 97% or 99.99%?\"\nPage 49 of: \"Models, manifestation and attribution of climate change\"\n\nFor the consensus on A3 and A4: \n\nAmong AAAS (American Academy for the Advancement of Science) scientists with relevant expertise (PhD earth scientists current working), there's a 95% consensus that climate change was a serious problem and a 93% consensus that recent warming is mostly caused by humans:\n\n\"Earth Scientists Views on Climate Change\"\nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/\n\nAnd in another survey, ~87% of climate researchers thought that humans caused (or will cause) most of the recent (or near future) climate change, while ~86% of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and/or a threat to humanity:\n\nFigures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of: \"The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016\"\nhttps://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf\n\n\n\n\"currently the empirical data needs a fudge factor of multiplying what we know by 3 times in order to get the models to create the claimed future change.\"\n\nIf you're talking about positive feedback, then yes, that does applying CO2-induced warming. But not, it's not just a \"fudge factor\". It includes evidence-based conclusions regarding surface albedo, clouds, water vapor, etc. I discuss that further here:\n\nhttp://blamethenoctambulantjoycean.blogspot.com/2017/09/myth-no-hot-spot-implies-less-global_15.html\n\nClimate models actually tend to under-estimate that positive feedback, and thus under-estimate how much global warming will be amplified in the future. For instance:\n\n\"Climate Sensitivity in the Geologic Past\n[...]\nProxies for CO2 and temperature generally imply high climate sensitivities: ≥3 K per CO2 doubling during ice-free times (fast-feedback sensitivity) and ≥6 K during times with land ice (Earth-system sensitivity). Climate models commonly underpredict the magnitude of climate change and have fast-feedback sensitivities close to 3 K\"\n\n\n\n\"The problem with the science, and the message, is that if you plug in the numbers we have into the models, there is little to no change. They found that the numbers needed to be 3 times bigger to create the effect that was desired, and then set about attempting to explain that this 3 fold increase in the empirical data was valid due to \"forcings\".\"\n\nNo. The direct forcing from CO2 yields roughly 1.1K of warming per doubling of CO2. That is amplified by three-fold to ~3K due to feedbacks, not forcings. These feedbacks include positive feedback from water vapor, clouds, and reduced surface albedo. These are included in the climate models. For example, see figure 5 of this paper:\n\n\"Positive feedback in climate: stabilization or runaway, illustrated by a simple experiment\"\nhttps://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00022.1", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The problem is that you could actually convince a lot more people to avoid certain meats than you can convince people to go vegan. You're hurting the cause in a sense because you turn people off of the issue by telling them it's all meat.

I don't even want to get into the water consumption because we'll just go off on a tangent, but, yes I am aware of that fact.\n\nAnd, yes, there are more people, cows, pigs, chickens, etc. My point was there were millions of large herd animals prior to global civilization and their presence alone did not significantly tip the scales of the climate; certainly not with the speed we're changing it now in any event. That was in response to someone above claiming that \"animals do not create pollution.\" Bullshit they don't. The difference is how they live that determines the effect of their pollution.

Earth is at about 400ppm but greenhouses get many times more pumped in for plant growth. highest levels in last 1000 yrs yes. but many times higher levels for most of life on earth. life flourishes at higher levels. CO2 is a result of global warming not the cause. intergalactic radiation (forming clouds that reflect suns heat) are pushed away by solar winds (increased solar activity from flares, hot spots) allowing more solar energy to be irradiated, warming planet, which then releases more CO2. graphs show amazing correlation of sun activity then global temp increase, then CO2 rise.

Perhaps the province you visited might already have fully implemented one, but that's a different story and these taxes are usually designed to be revenue-neutral, in which the money goes toward making low/zero-emission cars cheaper and improving public transport in areas where it's lacking.\n\nAlso...climate change isn't just everything getting progressively and permanently warmer, which is why it's not 'global warming', and freak weather incidents aren't an indicator of much of anything on a long-term scale. That's why US Senator Jim Inhofe's idea to bring a snowball into Congress as 'proof' that climate change was a hoax made him an utter laughing stock. Today it randomly decided to start snowing here in Vienna after weeks of sun and rain, but that doesn't mean that the oceans aren't dramatically acidifying, sea levels rising and winter ice caps rapidly shrinking.\n\nWhat pollution does have an immediate effect on is the air we breathe and water we drink. Is it not a good idea to reduce our emissions simply for those two, essential things, if not for the longevity of the planet/human race?\n\nAnd electric cars are indeed happenning, espcially in places like Norway (which has very far distances between population centres, I should add), where the (concervative) government is providing heavy incentives for EVs. And considering that the cars are now nearing 300 miles of range (which is wholly adequate--a human can't really go more than that without needing to stop anyway), it's not going to take 30 years to get to 500+ range.

According to the second law of thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation. In this paper the popular conjecture is analyzed and the underlying physical principles are clarified. By showing that (a) there are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects, (b) there are no calculations to determine an average surface temperature of a planet, (c) the frequently mentioned difference of 33 degrees Celsius is a meaningless number calculated wrongly, (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately, (e) the assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical, (f) thermal conductivity and friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is falsified.\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Zoe Phin", "channel": "UCn4tgj2phtAG-K6D7cgvLBw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQVbxACS_2urmr7Jix7HeprtXir4K3nHCdM6ier=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There is only 8 countries that have land above 60 degrees north and they're mostly habitable because of the warm currents that flow near their coasts. Rising sea levels caused by melting glaciers and ice might very likely stop the currents. The warm Gulf stream from the Caribbean flowing all the way to the coast of Iceland and Norway warms up all the Nordic countries and without that the climate there would be so cold that life there would become nearly impossible. Also the warm Alaskan current might stop due to rising sea levels. That is why you see the Nordic countries and Canada battling against climate change.
