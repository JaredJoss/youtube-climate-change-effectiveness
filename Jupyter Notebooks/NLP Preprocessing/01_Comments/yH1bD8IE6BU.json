Trees will help actually as they absorb Co2 in replacement for clean releasing clean air and cool the plannet by providing enough water, guarding against climate desasters and stopping places from becomming deserts. Most scientists now confirm that  trees are the most effective solution for tackling climate change. This will also provide poor countries with jobs by making tree planting a sustainable income for them as well as giving them grown food to live on. So much good overall.  We will though need to plant an extra 1 billion trees at the very least to make the slightest difference since there are 13 trillion (13 numbers long) trees on the plannet overall, hence the small difference. So this is more important that ever. There are big organisions that you can support such as Ecosia which now has at least 15 million users world wide since growing for the past 10 years and had now planted 100 mill to date. Or you could also support Eden Reforestation Projects who have planted over 485 million trees and most recnetly have planyed 40 million in the past months so I do recomend doing your bit. After all more trees being cut is has laregly contriduted to the worsoning climate so I trust you will know well enough to act on this info play your part in this fight.

Even if you plant a single tree, you can Geotag it and upload it to the Government website. So those 250 Million trees are actually there on the ground. Not just on paper.\n.\nDon't know what logic you are applying regarding Monsoon and Solar, but in reality its actually the opposite. Here is a paper with DOI: 10.1038/s41467-020-18318-7\nIt explains how India has excess solar and wind power capacity in Monsoon season insomuch that it has to curtail output by around 25% in Wind and 26% in Solar in the country. \n.\nWhatever forest India lost was around 5% of total forest land in India. This drop occurred over two decades. Today, around 21% of Indian land is under forests. India set a goal in 2015 Pairs Climate Deal to reforest 33% of total Indian land area by 2030. In India, the problem today is degradation of forest, not deforestation. Overall, India's forest area is growing. Problem is that unsustainable use of firewood is leading to thinning out of dense forests. One thing the government has done to stop this is to provide heavily subsidized LPG for cooking and the effort has borne fruit. \n.\nMost of these efforts have occurred only recently, under the current government that has been in power since 2014 (an year before the Paris Climate Deal). So the data of the 2001-2015 period is not a good indicator of what is about to happen in the future. This has already been seen in the growth of Renewables in India, the effect of forest conservation efforts will be visible after some more time. The kind of issues you are pointing to are surface issues. The Indian Central Government already understands them and has proven beyond doubt that its commitment to fighting climate change is genuine. Its not looking at total forest land, its also looking at quality of forests and is therefore targeting a trees as a certain Gigaton of additional Carbon sink.

The \"study\" you provided is actually an article, a collection of overly optimistic projections, based on models. We live in the era of Covid, where models used to impose lockdowns have missed their target by as much as 2500%. So excuse me for not being as optimistic as you are...\n2. What bothers me most is that you took a model and a projection and presented it as real world data. It is not. You either didn;t read the \"study\", or you are misrepresenting the facts in order to mislead me (and others).\n3. The article uses some tricks in order to achieve its goals. For example, it bunches up solar and wind.  Also, it talks about storage, whereas this other article\nhttps://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/opinion-energy-storage-in-india-a-perspective/76022409\nsays India didn;t have the legal framework for storage just one year ago, let alone the storage facilities...\n4. Solar is great, except it;s inefficient, panels need replacing on average every 20-30 years, and it also takes a lot of coal to produce PV panels. Solar doesn;t  run in the dark. And without storage, what you;re doing with wind and solar is put a lot of power into the grid that gets wasted away, while at the same time running full power on fossil fuel.\n5. The \"study\" runs on the presumption that fossil-fuel can be dialed up or down. That doesn;t happen in reality, because it takes days to power back up a coal plant and because constantly dialing it up or down destroys it.\n6. For all its overly optimistic tone, even the article you quoted acknowledges coal is the single largest contributor to energy production in India and is set to remain the main energy source in the future. With consumption projected to increase 3-4 times in the coming decades, that means more coal burned, more CO2 produced.\n7. I;'m not going to comment on the rest, it looks like you copy/pasted things from an Indian government propaganda pamphlet.\n8. To sum things up, India buns lots of coal and is going to burn even more in the future. Probably as much as you would need full grown trees growing all over India to compensate just a bit of it. India has done some great solar projects. Even those projects have massive carbon footprints. And the green energy they produce goes to waste for the most part. It all depends on storage, with existing storage options being either very ridiculous (like using solar energy to pump oil/gas) or very misleading (battery production is very polluting in itself).\nP.S.

Lets go back to your original assertion: \"all those GigaWatts of Solar are powerless in-front of Monsoon clouds\". Well, here is a study from a rooftop power plant in an Engineering Institute that looked seasonal variations: DOI -  10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.013 \nThis time I made sure its a study and not a simulation lol. From this study, we note tht while the average sunshine period drops quite a bit in Monsoon season, the variation in net monthly yield of power from the solar plant varies less. Variation is there no doubt, but not enough to be a deal-breaker. Moreover, as you said, battery storage policy has been released by Government of India, so its only a matter of time before solar storage starts widespread roll-out. India's 2030 target is for 60% of its installed capacity to be non-fossil fuels so that 40% of its electricity generation can be from non-fossil fuels. Clearly, Indian stakeholders are well aware of the impact of monsoon (and other seasonal variations) on Solar plants.\n.\n2.) You first insinuated that the 250 Million tree drive in India might be fake and I responded with how newly planted trees are geotagged to prevent fraud and cooked up numbers. And your response is that \"I just copied government propaganda\"? You tell me if this is a logical argument? Why are you so hell bent on being skeptical?\n.\n3.) I never disputed the fact that India would still need Coal power plants. Indian government had vociferously defended its historic right to Coal powered plants that provide the base load in the Paris Climate Deal. India's 2030 target as stated by India in 2015 Paris Deal is 40% of total electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources. Fact remains that India is the only G20 country to have pledged enough to ensure a <2 degree rise in Global Temperatures. All other G20 nations have failed to pledge enough for a <2 degree rise. \nSource: climateactiontracker . org \n.\nYeah, I know, its just  pledge. Well, so far, India is working hard to achieve that pledge. The only risk is if India goes forward with construction of more Coal power plants as per the government's stated intentions of building 90GW of more Coal Power Plants. That said, its apparent that Indian Government is not trying to be opaque about its fight against Climate Change. It is making a genuine effort at balancing India's economic growth with reducing Carbon Emissions intensity.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Death Parade", "channel": "UCQMoaX6IYXnlmULhlI-FP5A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQtUktMLqZRV3dXKG8ke81GUTQx2o0GYW5YhHlx=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You obviously come from a very optimistic, pro-government background, whereas I operate on the presumption that governments (even more so today) aren't trustworthy. We are worlds apart, not just geographically :)\nA pledge is just a pledge and if we look behind the curtains, we may discover a pledge is just a trick. With things being what they are, what I'm afraid will happen is we'll end up burning more coal for more power, while at the same time producing excess solar and wind that just goes to waste. Of course, if we produce as much green energy as fossil-fuel derived energy, we can claim we cut down our emissions by 50%. When in reality we raised our emissions and created a smoke screen for it. There's a term for that. I won;t use it, for fear I might get censored. It starts with \"green\" and end with \"-ing\" :)\nThe way I see it, the best solution would be to use solar and wind locally. The wind stops - you send the workers home or wait for it to pick back up. As long as it all pours down to the grid, and the certificates, we're just fooling ourselves.

Some examples:\n1) CO2 is a pollutant, a well-known greenhousegas. We have CO and CO2 detectors in our homes, because if those levels get too high, we die.\n2) plants need more than just CO2 to grow, and having excessively high CO2 levels doesn't help plants. On top of that, plants \"breathe\", meaning they excrete CO2 back into the atmosphere as well. Furthermore, only some plants benefit from slightly higher CO2 levels (as in, in a greenhouse, under specific parameters, taken care of to make sure they get the right nutrients, sunlight, water intake, etc).\n3) we're not plants.\n4) we see a significant impact in CO2 and global warming. We came from about 0.02% and are up to 0.04%. While this may seem small, there are plenty of examples that can be given where such a difference can mean life or death. Just look at the food industry, for example.\n5) the Sun's changing activity has caused a negative effect on average global temperatures, meaning if it were the Sun, the Earth would be slightly cooling, not heating up.\n6) changes in the Earth's orbit occur over thousands of years, not in the span of 2 centuries.\n7) there is no natural cycle or other natural event which can explain this rapid increase in average global temperatures.\n8) we know without a shadow of a doubt that global warming is real, that it is entirely caused by our pollution (specifically ghgs) and that we'll be majorly screwed if we don't fix it.\n\nSo once more, PLEASE get a proper education in the matter before repeating anti-science propaganda.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Jehan Desains", "channel": "UC2wAsuS5UMXB_Zk8YACfDPA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHXGMWKLpPq1Y2_p-8kCzLNbtKfLog_yjeLBa7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

No knowledge about anything, but loving putting up a big mouth.\n\n\"without CO2 production, we'd go back to starving in caves\" -> that's just utter and total bullshit and you know it. The Industrial Revolution didn't start until 1750, at which time civilisation was already pretty advanced and we had already achieved a great deal. So to say we'd go back to living in caves, makes zero sense, especially considering the fact that we have better sources now.\n\n\"no source of energy will reduce the effect humans have on this planet\" -> again a completely false statement. Using resource efficient methods, we can significantly reduce our impact. Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, etc. all have a far smaller impact on nature than fossil fuels do. On top of that, a lot of it can be recycled, meaning a far smaller footprint on top of that, and significantly reduced emissions. As we keep developping new technologies, we can further improve upon what we have, ever moving forward to a smaller impact on nature.\n\nWhat do I do? Firstly, I informed myself properly and know that if my government produces a lot of renewable energy, this means that the electricity I consume has a far smaller footprint than if my country were to fully rely on fossil fuels. This has a massive impact, far greater than any one person can achieve. Even if I had a net zero impact, it wouldn't matter without this one factor. That being said, I don't own a car, use public transport if needed, have a healthy, balanced diet, recycle, etc. Normal stuff, but a big enough impact on reducing emissions.\n\nSo congratulations for once again proving your own statement that stupidity cannot be fixed.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Jehan Desains", "channel": "UC2wAsuS5UMXB_Zk8YACfDPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHXGMWKLpPq1Y2_p-8kCzLNbtKfLog_yjeLBa7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

America is historically the biggest pollutor in the world, and even today it's the number two. Under Obama, who was fully behind the Paris Climate Accords, some progress was made, but Trump was clearly against all that and made things worse again. No idea what Biden is going to do yet.\n\nThat being said, if we look at the data between 2000-2014, there were 21 countries in the world that both reduced their carbon emissions AND had economic growth. Out of those 21, the US ranked 18th at a 6% reduction. Number 1 was Denmark with 30% reduction. Now, granted, that data is a bit old now, but does set a good example against the American narrative that they're somehow not responsible for anything.\n\nIf we look at China, we see that they're by far the biggest producer of renewable energy, that they have the biggest growth in total amount of renewable energy produced, AND that they produce the most renewable energy sources (solar panels) which are sold worldwide. So while China is currently the biggest pollutor, they are clearly doing something about it, now having about 25% of their total energy production coming from renewables. Meanwhile, America is further and further lagging behind. Last info I saw put America at 14,7% renewables.\n\nCongo and Venezuela are non-issues because their rainforests compensate for their small industries.\n\nSo once more, the claim that America is the biggest \"good boy\" in the world on this topic, is FALSE. Dozens of countries already rely on more than 50% renewable energy, and a few are already at 100%, like Iceland. America, arguably the biggest economy in the world, definitely has the assets to do what needs to be done, but does not have the political courage nor moral decency to do so. America doesn't give a fuck about anyone, not even America. And that's why you lag behind on everything.

No, manmade global warming is absolutely real, and CO2 is a well-known, well-proven GHG.\n\nFirstly, solar activity. Solar activity has been down for the last 2 decades. Based on this, we should be seeing a cooling effect. Instead, we get a rapid heating effect. So it's not the Sun.\n\nSecondly, \"CO2 is plant food\" is so simplistic, it's just wrong. Plants can convert CO2 to O2, which is awesome, but at night they \"exhale\" CO2, and they release a lot of it at death as well. Furthermore, only some plants benefit from slightly higher CO2 levels, on the condition that they also get the right amount of sunlight, water, nutrients, etc. AKA in a controlled greenhouse setting, not in the real world. Also note, we're not plants.\n\nThirdly, the physical events you deny, are literally happening in front of us. The arctic ice is melting at record rates, having lost most of its mass already. Islands have already disappeared or are at risk of disappearing. The cold fronts America has experienced recently, are a result of global warming, as the arctic jet stream is destabilised and thus the polar vortex lashes out south. Growing seasons have become less stable as we get more volatile temperatures. We get more heat waves, destroying crops. Droughts, floods, storms, etc. When we look outside, beyond the length of our noses, or better yet: GO outside, we discover that manmade global warming is a reality. We used to have winters with snow. Summers used to be mild and only occassionally hit the 30s. It used to be a temperate zone. AGW is real, buddy. Hate to say it, but your anti-science propaganda is fooling you.\n\nFourthly, the Medieval Warm Period was a natural event over centuries, which only hit the northern hemisphere, and was far less of a problem than the current global warming crisis. We're now beyond that point, and it's not just local, it's global. We're at the hottest point in 23 million years.\n\nFifthly, while it's true that temperature has an effect on CO2, CO2 also has an equal effect on temperatures. Which happens to be one of the tipping points. If we spew out too much CO2, which is drawing closer by the minute, we'll come to a point where it's a perpetual cycle of high CO2 increasing temperature, and high temperatures increasing CO2. Thus heading towards Venus.\n\nPlease, Roy, learn about what the fuck you're talking about, because all you're doing is spewing long-debunked anti-science propaganda.

Let me provide a source to prove to you how records work and how patently false your claims are regarding them. Compare the heat vs cold records and pay special attention to any records set since the year 2000:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_weather_records#Temperature\n\nAs you can see in the lists, since the year 2000, 83 countries set new heat records. This compared to only 20 setting cold records. This thoroughly debunks your claims on records, so that's settled.\n\nSecondly, if this were just a natural evolution, the temperature increase would've stopped decades ago, yet contrary to any and all natural phenomena and cycles, it keeps on rising. There simply is no natural explanation for this. This should not be happening, based on all natural factors.

{"cid": "Ugx-5feds_BW8W4TQER4AaABAg.9L4JFhp91cQ9LQ-SVOz9WZ", "text": "¬†@Roy Langston¬† I grow tired of your childish behaviour and your constant lying and bullshittery. You keep proving your utter and complete lack of knowledge and understanding of this topic. Seriously, go get a basic education.\n\n1) the Medieval Warm Period was a LOCAL event, not a global one. This is an extremely important factor which you conveniently omit from your propaganda narrative. This means that in Greenland specifically, the place you're talking about regarding the archaeological finds, it was relatively hot compared to the global average and the average over time. This local warm period lasted for centuries, allowing the Vikings to settle there during the summer months. After the MWP, we saw centuries of building up ice, including during the Little Ice Age, all of which has since melted in a matter of decades (not centuries), and this very rapid warming is not just in Greenland, but is happening all over the world. Lets give some household analogies, in the hopes your feeble mind might understand. The MWP is like having a steak in the fridge, nice and cool, then putting it on the counter for a day to say \"look, it's room temperature!\". The current warming is like having that same steak put back into a freezer for several hours until it's nice and frozen, then putting it in a microwave for 10 minutes to find out that it's getting close to being cooked. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_record_of_the_last_2,000_years#/media/File:2000+_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age_-_Ed_Hawkins.svg -> here you see a nice, scientifically accurate representation of average global temperatures, including the MWP, LIA, and current warm period.\n\nAs per the Holocene Climate Optimum, this too was colder than today, and there's strong evidence suggesting it was not a global event either. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png -> As you can see on this graph, the hottest point of the HCO still falls far below today's temperatures (2016 being marked to the right of the graph). The northern hemisphere was warmer, but the tropics and southern hemisphere were cooler, which has a lot to do with landmasses I'd say. So once more, you've been completely proven wrong due to your ineptitude and lack of understanding of this topic.\n\nThe Eemian was a 15.000-year long period, reaching temperatures close to ours today, which we have surpassed already. Think about that for a while: nature needed thousands of years during a warm period to reach temperatures we reached in a span of decades due to human pollution. So seriously, take a good look in the mirror when calling someone a liar.\n\n2)  here's a nice little graph showing natural vs human influence on our current climate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Temperature_And_Forces.svg -> as you can clearly see, this is NOT NATURAL. While nature COULD achieve temperatures similar to or higher than today's temperatures, and has done so in the past, it either does so over a prelonged period of time (centuries, millenia), or are a result of some big event, like an asteroid, supervolcanic eruption, etc. None of that is the case in the current warming period, which is entirely, 100% caused by human pollution. Based on natural factors alone, Earth should be cooling by 1¬∞C, not continue to rise. This also conclusively debunks your \"Little Ice Age\" tantrum for the umpteenth time. Let me spell it out for you again: if this were natural, temperatures would've stabilised 1¬∞C ago. The fact that it continues to rise at record pace, proves unequivocally that it's not natural and not due to the end of the Little Ice Age.\n\n3) we are looking beyond just outside our window, and we know with absolute certainty, beyond any shadow of a doubt, regardless of all the lies you spew, that things are NOT normal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_impacts_of_climate_change#Cryosphere -> more proof of rapid melting of ice. As shown in point 1, the natural Holocene temperatures are 1¬∞C lower than they are today, proving beyond any shadow of a doubt that this is far from natural, but in fact entirely caused by humans.\n\n4) habitat loss is a result of rapid climate change, as droughts, floods, and unsuitable temperatures and extremes make areas ill suited for certain lifeforms. There have been far more severe weather events than ever before. Just look at forest fires, for example.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_ecosystems\nThe reduction in death toll has everything to do with modern society vs old society. Better building materials, faster response teams and medical help, international cooperation, etc.\n\nThere you have it, every single point you tried to make, failed miserably. You're embarassing yourself here, and calling me a liar every single sentence only makes you look even worse, especially after this very thorough beating.\n\nHere's a list of the most common anti-science arguments on global warming.

Every scientist and organisation in the entire world agrees manmade global warming is real, has already started the next mass extinction event, and will only get far worse if we don't fix it soon. The end of humanity is a reality of this crisis. Everyone also agrees we'll see more droughts, floods, heat waves, heavy storms, forest fires, migration, sea levels rising, disruptance of natural flows (sea and air), etc. all of which are terrible for life.\n\nA real life example of how your \"longer growing seasons\" have already backfired: we used to live in a temperate zone. With a hotter, dryer climate, grapes grow better for wine production. However, the heat waves caused most of the grapes to shrivel up and dry out, causing a failed harvest.

It's really not that hard to understand, IF you don't go out of your way to refuse to understand it, as you do.\n\n\"where crops grow may shift\" -> in an ever expanding population, we need more crops and more stability in crop production. This is the OPPOSITE of what's happening due to manmade global warming. We get less suitable land and less stability in production, with more people. This means food shortages, which means famines, which means death. A very simple fact.\n\n\"humans adapted and even thrived\" -> those few who survived managed to adapt to slowly changing climates and had long, stable periods. However, when there were sudden shifts, those civilisations quickly ended. The Akkadian Empire fell due to droughts. The Old Kingdom of Egypt fell due to droughts. Other areas in the world suffered as well during the 4.2kya event of droughts in some areas, and floods in others. With the Akkadian Empire, their northern region was their breadbasket. Just a couple of years of droughts meant their crops failed, which meant famine and disease, mass migration, conflict, death, and easy pickings for other entities like nomadic tribes which were otherwise a lot weaker. The availability of food is essential to the survival of not only a nation, but life as a whole. We are in a transition period of our own creation. We were in a good spot, good food production, stable climate, etc. and we started fucking that up. Now the climate is heating up rapidly and crops are already failing because of it. Now, thanks to globalisation and technology, we can handle a lot more than the Akkadians could, but the problem remains the same. Due to manmade global warming, the global climate changes in such a way as to reduce food production. Desertification is a serious problem in a lot of areas, droughts, floods, heat waves, hail storms, etc. causing even more problems. Like I said, even in my own area, we've seen crops fail several times due to such events.\n\nYes, every scientist and organisation in the world agrees we created the next mass extinction event due to manmade global warming. This is not disputed. Bjorn Lomborg has a PhD in political science, not anything related to the climate. As such, he has frequently been called out for cherry-picking, downplaying, and misrepresenting data to come to false conclusions. Not a credible source when it comes to science. In fact, he's considered a non-scientist pushing opinion pieces rather than scientific evidence. So if your great example of people disagreeing with climate science is a non-scientist with no formal education related to the topic, who has been frequently called out for misrepresenting the data, then I'm definitely not impressed. Even if it were an ACTUAL scientist with ACTUAL knowledge of the topic, with an opinion deviating from the evidence, it wouldn't change anything. Is this seriously all you've got?\n\nI've skimmed the IPCC report of 2014 and did not find what you claimed. Please refer me to the page in that report. Best case scenario for you, is you blatantly ignored everything else in the article which proves you wrong and you cherry-picked data which, in context, destroys your claims. Especially since the entire IPCC is in agreement that this IS an existential threat that needs global attention and action. And while everyone agrees it would be expensive to fix and would face its challenges, everyone also agrees that NOT fixing it would mean the end of us all.\n\nCorrectly understanding manmade global warming is clearly not an option for you, who deliberately ignores and denies any and all evidence of its reality.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Jehan Desains", "channel": "UC2wAsuS5UMXB_Zk8YACfDPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHXGMWKLpPq1Y2_p-8kCzLNbtKfLog_yjeLBa7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Since the mass of oxygen weighs more than three times as much as carbon, burning just two pounds of wood yields over eight pounds of CO2.\n[1 pound carbon + 3.6 pounds oxygen + 3.6 pounds oxygen = 8.2 pounds of carbon dioxide]\n\nNote: Trees, as they grow, re-absorb carbon dioxide from the air; but, with increasing deforestation, desertification, soil degradation, et al, CO2 levels in the biosphere are increasing (especially when you factor in the burning of stupendous amounts of previously sequestered carbon in the form of fossil fuels).\n\nThis strengthens the greenhouse effect and results in a steadily warming planet. And with each and every year being warmer than the years before, only the blissfully ignorant and the hopelessly naive can fail to see what the future holds.\n\nSearch:\n‚Äòcarbon cycle global warming‚Äô\n\nResource:\n‚ÄúGreenhouse Effect‚Äù Physics-¬†\n62 part series.¬†\n‚Ä™https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2gX-ftPVXUNpoyWX5PeZQy5CNlPh0r3‚Ä¨\n\nSearch:\n‚Äòsamslair blogspot AGW‚Äô", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sam Lair", "channel": "UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHI0ofAQcclqyQYWFUekfrl6JC9l_6ODYX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It wasn't until the mid 1800s that the process became mechanised and began to exponentially accelerate. It was no longer a cottage industry and they kept excellent records at that point, and as we began to massively extract and burn the fossil fuels that had lain underground for 370 million years, the earth's temperature began to rise.\n\nOdd that!\n\nAt the rate we are burning fossil fuels we are creating¬†21.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, accumulating and accelerating.¬†\n\nThat does not include the massive amount of burnt and destroyed trees and plant matter, nor the stupendous amount of methane produced by agriculture. We are already at the tipping point where methane lying frozen under the tundra is melting and¬†erupting¬† with even more methane deep in the ocean that will be released by rising sea temperatures.\n\nMost dangerously the conditions no longer exist for the massive burial and fossilisation of the carbon that happened in a relatively short period during the Carbonaceous, which is why that period got its name.\n\n...but as \"a scientist myself\" you would know that. \n\n...or not, ...apparently.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Peter Breis", "channel": "UCXzN-8W9rEr3aKTpb_L4kFQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQAd94hd6PYmGeC_BHfAVf64oZelp-LnLH-DQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you haven't noticed with all these time animated statistics there are abrupt changes when for example the Soviet Union breaks up and Russia becomes the remnant portion and the republics break loose to form their own barline.

The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) was an organization within the United States Department of Energy that had the primary responsibility for providing the US government and research community with global warming data. The CDIAC's only job was to collect data related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.  CDIAC was only founded in 1982 and closed September 30, 2017.\n\nThe only reliable MEASURED data that it can have collected is thus between 1982 and 2017 and it can only have collected data in the USA as most of the other countries have their own centres or don't collect anything.  There is no evidence for any of these figures- none.\n\nI  want to know where this data came from otherwise, as far as I am concerned it is propaganda.  For example, I went to China in 1989 and it was positively spewing masses and masses of smoke, fumes etc into the air, all the heating and cooking was also CO2 producing.  The air over the canals was so thick with pollutants,  it made your eyes water.\n\nAnd I've also been to India, home to the kerosene light the wood stove and vehicles that once upon a time turned the air rust coloured.

{"cid": "Ugwk5H-n7Ptob3bjNjN4AaABAg.922eafM5i4F9KpKIZNG_qY", "text": "‚Äã¬†@tomservo¬† The 97% figure you've come up with is just not true.  In actual fact there a scientific consensus on the issue of climate change.  The Academies of Science from 80 countries plus many scientific organizations that study climate science. \nConsensus on Consensus - Cook et al. (2016) was a co-authored paper that settled the expert climate consensus question once and for all. The two key conclusions from the paper are:\n\r\n1) Depending on exactly how you measure the expert consensus, it‚Äôs somewhere between 90% and 100% that agree humans are responsible for climate change, with most of the studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists.\r\n\r\n2) The greater the climate expertise among those surveyed, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming.\n\nSolar activity - A number of independent measurements of solar activity indicate the sun has shown a slight cooling trend since 1960, over the same period that global temperatures have been warming. Over the last 35 years of global warming, sun and climate have been moving in opposite directions. An analysis of solar trends concluded that the sun has actually contributed a slight cooling influence in recent decades (Lockwood 2008).\n\nEarth's orbit and tilt - Yes this affects climate however these orbital phases are in patterns of tens of thousands of years.  We are currently in a relatively cool orbital phase, whilst the Earth is getting warmer.\n\nOcean currents - are changing because of climate change affecting the ice caps, not the other way around.\n\nMethane  - is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 but there is over 200 times more CO2 in the atmosphere. Eg - CO2 levels are 380 ppm while methane levels are 1.75ppm. Hence the amount of warming methane contributes is calculated at 28% of the warming CO2 contributes.\n\nWater vapour - Water vapour is the dominant positive feedback in our climate system and amplifies any warming caused by changes in atmospheric CO2. This positive feedback is why climate is so sensitive to CO2 warming.\n\nVolcanic activity - Volcanoes emit around 0.3 billion tonnes of CO2 per year. This is about 1% of human CO2 emissions which is around 29 billion tonnes per year.\n\nCosmic rays - There has been no correlation between cosmic rays and global temperatures over the last 30 years of global warming.  In fact, in recent years when cosmic rays should have been having their largest cooling effect on record, temperatures have been at their highest on record.\n\nStratospheric circulation - The effect from stratospheric water vapor contributes a fraction of the temperature change imposed from man-made greenhouse gases.\n\nCO2 and methane were involved in most of the climate changes in Earth‚Äôs past. When they were reduced, the global climate became colder. When they were increased, the global climate became warmer. When CO2 levels jumped rapidly, the global warming that resulted was highly disruptive and sometimes caused mass extinctions. Humans today are emitting prodigious quantities of CO2, at a rate faster than even the most destructive climate changes in earth's past.  Therefore not an example I would use to try and brush human influence aside.\n\nYou could give a huge list of errors of the IPCC but you don't even give a short one so I'll try and guess what you were talking about (you may find there are some issues you didn't know about):-\n\nHimalayan glaciers - They said they would disappear by 2035.  Obviously that's not going to happen but that was one paragraph of a 1000 page report.  However satellites and on-site measurements are observing that Himalayan glaciers are disappearing at an accelerating rate.  Man-made climate change deniers will often focus on isolated incorrect predictions from scientists but fail to acknowledge the huge amount of mistakes they make and the flawed science they use.  The moral of the story is stick to peer reviewed scientific literature as this report initially wasn't.  When it finally was the error was corrected and the rest of the huge report was left intact, something that deniers conveniently fail to mention.\n\nAmazon rainforests -  The IPCC statement on Amazon rainforests was correct, and was incorrectly reported in some media.  The error was incorrect citation, failing to mention the peer-reviewed papers where the data came from. The peer-reviewed science prior to the 2007 IPCC report found that up to 40% of the Brazilian forest is vulnerable to drought. Subsequent field research has confirmed this assessment.\n\nIncorrect temperature predictions - This came from a claim from by climate change denier Lord Monkton.  The IPCC surface temperature projections have been exceptionally accurate thus far.  Lord Monckton has taken a single equation from the IPCC, used it in an inappropriate manner, and then attributed his results to the IPCC.  He uses a method that is clearly intended to examine the long-term response of temperature to changes in carbon dioxide, and which is never used by the IPCC (nor should it be) to make predictions about current temperature trends. A slight change in Lord Monckton‚Äôs methodology as of July 2010 still does not make his method or attribution remotely appropriate.\n\nMedieval warm period - The original global temperature schematic which appeared in the IPCC First Assessment Report and seemed to show the Medieval Warm Period hotter than present was based on the central England temperature record, and ended in the 1950s. It was only a schematic, and based on one isolated geographic location. Subsequent IPCC reports showed actual hemispheric temperature reconstructions. They did not \"disappear\" the MWP, they simply presented the best available data.\n\nDire predictions - Numerous papers have documented how IPCC predictions are more likely to underestimate the climate response.  The IPCC lead authors are experts in their field, instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature. Consequently, the IPCC reports tend to be cautious in their conclusions. Comparisons to the most recent data consistently finds that climate change is occurring more rapidly and intensely than indicated by IPCC predictions.\n\nIn the scientific community and media, IPCC's reports are broadly viewed as the most comprehensive and reliable assessments of climate change. In 2007, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  So they are absolutely credible and don't cease to be because you say so.\n\nAl Gore's film was \"broadly accurate\" according to an expert witness called when an attempt was made through the courts to prevent the film being shown in schools. While there are minor errors in 'An Inconvenient Truth', the main truths presented - evidence to show mankind is causing global warming and its various impacts is consistent with peer reviewed science.

So if a paper didn't explicitly say \"very likely\" then it wouldn't be included in that section.  This is why so many papers were rejected for having no opinion.  A lot of these papers were concerned with methodology rather than summaries and also because so many climate scientists now accept that humans are causing global warming there would be no reason to explicitly state it given that the point of the papers was not clarify whether it was.  This is standard on any analysis of consensus.  The important results of this paper were:-\n\n66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW (anthropogenic global warming), \n32.6% endorsed AGW, \n0.7% rejected AGW and \n0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. \nAmong abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.  So the figure is sound.\n\nThere was also phase 2 of the study which you omitted:-  Authors were invited to rate their own papers to take into account non definitive summaries:-  \nA smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus.  \nAlso the paper found  that for both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. The analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.\n\nIf you want to argue the legitimacy of that figure from that one paper then that's fine but high figures of consensus have been backed up by subsequent studies:-\n\nOreskes 2004 and Peiser - A survey of all peer-reviewed abstracts on the subject 'global climate change' published between 1993 and 2003 shows that not a single paper rejected the consensus position that global warming is man caused.  75% of the papers agreed with the consensus position while 25% made no comment either way (focused on methods or paleoclimate analysis).\n\nDoran 2009 -  A survey of 3146 earth scientists asked the question \"Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?\". More than 90% of participants had Ph.D.s, and 7% had master‚Äôs degrees. Overall, 82% of the scientists answered yes. However, what are most interesting are responses compared to the level of expertise in climate science. Of scientists who were non-climatologists and didn't publish research, 77% answered yes. In contrast, 97.5% of climatologists who actively publish research on climate change responded yes.\n\nAnderegg 2010 - An independent study that surveys all climate scientists who have publicly signed declarations supporting or rejecting the consensus. They find between 97% to 98% of climate experts support the consensus. Moreover, they examine the number of publications by each scientist as a measure of expertise in climate science. They find the average number of publications by unconvinced scientists (eg - skeptics) is around half the number by scientists convinced by the evidence. Not only is there a vast difference in the number of convinced versus unconvinced scientists, there is also a considerable gap in expertise between the two groups.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "redplague", "channel": "UCtDIRCsIwsKpYCVY_FCUaBA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTtDPa9a9uiWOWvG3N1-yJfbdRL7dUGgGtgZp1a=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugwk5H-n7Ptob3bjNjN4AaABAg.922eafM5i4F9Kt0Ddzd0Vx", "text": "¬†@redplague¬† I think the take-home point here is that if we're going to talk about consensus, and the issue of climate change overall, we need to get very specific with definitions. The climate alarmists do a very good job of conflating issues. What exactly is this consensus? That the climate changes? That humans have something to do with it? Is it the level of human involvement? Does the consensus provide a timescale? Can they agree on the degree of change? And is some global warming even a bad thing? There are so many shades of gray, and the question, \"Is man-made climate change real\" is a completely meaningless question, it's actually several dozen questions with all sorts of nuance. I'd also like to see one of the alarmists answer the question: What EXACTLY is the ideal global temperature and CO2 level? What should we shoot for and how do we know (quantitatively) when the goal is reached? Those types of questions produce crickets. If we cannot answer those questions, or agree precisely what this consensus is, then the debate is over before it begins. The alarmists will throw around terms like \"climate denier\" to anyone who opposes them, without realizing what they're saying.  They know damn well that no one denies the existence of the climate, they use these terms to shut up any opposition and brand them as uneducated buffoons. They will NEVER be specific as to exactly what science has a consensus on, because the truth is it depends on the exact conclusion, and furthermore science is not perfect either. Scientists make mistakes too. Even furthermore, they know deep down that the problem can never be \"solved\" for if it is, they lose their cause. It's my observation that people complaining about various ills in society never seem interested in fixing those ills lest they lose them as campaign issues.\n\nSo the bottom line is that I have seen no proof, nor even consensus, that justifies the dramatic \"solutions\" we're seeing, such as Green New Deal*, no consensus on the more catastrophic positions of the climate alarmists, which have failed to come true over and over. I'm old enough to remember in the 70s and early 80s it was all about global cooling, then that turned out not to be true it turned to \"global warming\" and when that fizzled, the ultimate bet-hedger, \"climate change\" (as if their opponents are claiming that climate change is not real when everyone knows it's been changing on its own for 4 billion years).  Even the Cook Report fails to make the case that expert climatologists such as former VPs, TV personalities, former bartenders, lazy Socialist Senators, and emotionally-challenged high school girls are trying to make that we're somehow in the middle of some catastrophe.  I could give fact after fact, quote after quote from people like Marc Morano, Lord Monckton, and many climatologists who have left the global warming bandwagon (at great expense to their careers, I might add), and one make the counter that they're somehow \"paid off by big oil\" or \"conservative shills\", and I can equally point to the fact that most of the climate alarmists provide no proof and have no scientific credentials of their own. If one writes off the so-called \"climate deniers\" as conservative conspiracy theorists (as if we have some secret planet of our own that we fly home to at night so we don't have to live on the same planet as the alarmists), and yet accepts the pleas of a 16-year old Swedish girl and a bartender without any question, that shows this has become an entirely political issue. *BOTH sources, pro and against should be open to question and have to defend their stances, and yet only one of them is made to. We know science does not operate on consensus, it's in constant flux. Even something as basic as gravity has been turned on its head in just the last 100 years. It was once settled science that the Earth was at the center of the universe, that dark-skinned people were less intelligent (the \"science\" of phrenology), that there was nothing smaller than an atom, I could go on and on and on about the mistakes that science has made over the centuries; to say that ANYTHING is \"settled science\" is the most UN-scientific thing someone can do. So my objection is not so much to the assertion of man-made effect on the environment, that is a legitimate debate. My objection is to the people who demand that we accept THEIR hysterical theories, and that ANY questioning, any attempt to debate the issue is akin to the denial of the very existence of science itself. They come off as the used car dealer who seems just a little bit too anxious to sell you that car and hopes you don't look up its service history. The term \"science denier\" is an obvious crock (no one denies the existence of science or the climate) but it's intended to be politically divisive and shut down and censor anyone who doesn't agree with their radical solutions like the Green New Deal. Science does not operate that way. The whole point of this \"science\" which we're supposed to be against, is observation, data gathering and then debate on the meaning of the raw data. The eagerness by which the alarmists want to ram through their ideas, branding any opposition as some knuckle-dragging ignorant neanderthal takes away any credibility their side might otherwise have had.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "tomservo", "channel": "UCQJT1kLc-U-eI3IOtsViXmw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT72sCkUwJ6Nu6VCZRL5QwG3CWIa25c5vFgBkj0Ng=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugwk5H-n7Ptob3bjNjN4AaABAg.922eafM5i4F9KxzlFScszI", "text": "¬†@tomservo¬† Well a scientific consensus is reached when scientists stop arguing.  In terms of climate change nearly all have stopped arguing as the data I've provided you shows.  Man made climate change deniers put ridiculous demands on science that nobody should be arguing as your own refusal to accept this data shows.  Science is never 100% settled - science is about narrowing uncertainty. Different areas of science are understood with varying degrees of certainty. We have a high understanding of the warming effect of carbon dioxide. Poorly understood aspects of climate change do not change the fact that a great deal of climate science is well understood. \nI would agree though that climate scientists have done a poor job of communicating this to the general public.  In fact I would say deniers have done a better job of spreading conspiracies and bad science amongst the public.  I'm not sure exactly why this is but I have a couple of theories of my own:-\n1.  Scientists, with a few notable exceptions, are not really concerned with how the public of media perceives them and just concentrate on their work.  Whereas deniers, the majority of which aren't climate scientists tend to understand and are better able to use the media in seeding doubt.\n2.  Scientists will use facts, figures and graphs to illustrate their point.  I think a lot of the general public's eyes tend to glaze over at such things.  Deniers on the other hand will rely on rhetoric, hyperbole and cherry-picking to make their points very loudly.\n\nIn terms of what the consensus is on, well it's that humans are causing global warming.  Of course there is the question of how much.  One of the results of the Abstracts Survey dealt with this question.  This was a survey of abstracts like the other ones I told you about. A copy and paste of the results of this:-\n\n\n*In our survey, among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.  This is greater than 97% consensus of peer-reviewed papers because endorsement papers had more authors than rejection papers, on average.  Thus there is a 97.1% consensus in the peer-reviewed literature, and a 98.4% consensus amongst scientists researching climate change.  \nWe fully anticipate that some climate contrarians will respond by saying \"we don't dispute that humans cause some global warming.\" First of all, there are a lot of people who do dispute that there is a consensus that humans cause any global warming. Our paper shows that their position is not supported in the scientific literature.\r\n\r\nSecond, we did look for papers that quantify the human contribution to global warming, and most are not that specific. However, as noted above, if a paper minimized the human contribution, we classified that as a rejection. For example, if a paper were to say \"the sun caused most of the global warming over the past century,\" that would be included in the less than 3% of papers in the rejection categories.\r\n\r\nMany studies simply defer to the expert summary of climate science research put together by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which states that most of the global warming since the mid-20th century has been caused by humans. According to recent research, that statement is actually too conservative.\r\n\r\nOf the papers that specifically examine the human and natural causes of global warming, virtually all conclude that humans are the dominant cause over the past 50 to 100 years.*\n\nIf you still don't accept this consensus from all the data I've given you then I can't really think of anything else to convince you as you're basically just sticking your finger in your ears and yelling \"la, la, la\".\n\nI'm all for making the qualifications of what is considered a consensus more robust.  I mean why should barely qualified, if at all, people publish climate science papers and be considered in those figures.  I don't take my medical advice from a mechanic.  Let's just take into account the qualified climate scientists.  Of course the bad news for people like yourselves is that it makes your job harder as it's the qualified climate scientists that are overwhelmingly part of the consensus making it even more robust.\n\nUltimately if deniers wish to prove the vast majority of climate scientists wrong then they have to provide theories as to why the world is getting warmer that can be observed, proved and have repeatable results.  So far they have failed to do that, perfectly illustrated by the scientific theories you presented to me which I debunked.  Instead they'd rather rely on dodgy science and unjustified criticism's of the IPCC, which you vaguely mentioned but failed to specify, and fallacies about how science was wrong once so it must be wrong now.  And now on to one of those fallacies...\n\nThe Ice Age Fallacy - 'scientists showed concerns about global cooling which did not materialise, and there is therefore no need to heed current scientific concerns about global warming.'\nThe facts - The vast majority of climate papers in the 1970s predicted warming.  Peterson 2008 was a study of 68 scientific studies on Global Cooling from 1965 to 1979.  The results were:-\n62% predicted warming\n10% predicted cooling\n28% had no stance\nThe fact is that around 1970 there were 6 times as many scientists predicting a warming rather than a cooling planet.\n\nGlobal warming vs climate change - There have long been claims that some unspecified \"they\" has \"changed the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change'\". In reality, the two terms mean different things, have both been used for decades, and the only individual to have specifically advocated changing the name in this fashion is a global warming 'skeptic'.  'Global warming' refers to the long-term trend of a rising average global temperature.  'Climate change', again as the name suggests, refers to the changes in the global climate which result from the increasing average global temperature.\nFor example, a seminal climate science work is Gilbert Plass' 1956 study 'The Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climatic Change' (which coincidentally estimated the climate sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 3.6¬∞C, not far off from today's widely accepted most likely value of 3¬∞C).  Barrett and Gast published a letter in Science in 1971 entitled simply 'Climate Change'.  The journal 'Climatic Change' was created in 1977 (and is still published today).  The IPCC was formed in 1988, and of course the 'CC' is 'climate change', not 'global warming'.  There are many, many other examples of the use of the term 'climate change' many decades ago.  There is nothing new whatsoever about the usage of the term.\n\nLord Monkton is not a qualified climatologist.  He is a former journalist, public speaker and hereditary peer.  You could give some quotes from him but you don't.  So I will:-\n\"Those who warn of the dangers of climate change should be jailed\".\n\"There is no \"causative link\" from CO2-concentration to global average temperature\".  Most deniers would I think actually disagree with him on that one.  Why you would hold him up an example I don't know, especially with the mess he made of interpreting the IPCC temperature calculations as I pointed out in an earlier comment.\n\nMarc Morano - Also not a qualified climatologist.  Memorable quotes:-\nDescribed Greta Thunberg as an \"autistic prophet\". He retweeted criticisms of her that center on her autism.\n\"We should kick scientists when they're down. They deserve to be publicly flogged\".  Such a lovely man.  A real role model for the climate change denial scene.\n\nGreta Thunberg is an activist, not a climate scientist.  I'm not sure how I feel about her in terms of whether she's doing more harm than good but honestly start paying more attention to what climate scientists say, and not politicians and activists.\n\nIn terms of science being settled this is one of the problems of the misconceptions about science in the general public.   No science is ever ‚Äúsettled‚Äù; science deals in probabilities, not certainties. When the probability of something approaches 100%, then we can regard the science, colloquially, as ‚Äúsettled‚Äù.  With things like the theory of the sun orbiting the Earth, we didn't have the technology to confirm this one way or another, they were theories.  Once we did and confirmed it with a high probability there were still deniers for quite a while who wouldn't accept it.  Gravity is an example of something that we are learning more and more about.\nScientists have been predicting AGW, with increasing confidence, for decades (indeed, the idea was first proposed in 1896).  As science learned more about the climate system, a consensus gradually emerged. Many different lines of inquiry all converged on the IPCC‚Äôs 2007 conclusion that it is more than 90% certain that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are causing most of the observed global warming.  What about the remaining uncertainties? Shouldn‚Äôt we wait for 100% certainty before taking action? Outside of logic and mathematics, we do not live in a world of certainties. Science comes to tentative conclusions based on the balance of evidence. The more independent lines of evidence are found to support a scientific theory, the closer it is likely to be to the truth. Just because some details are still not well understood should not cast into doubt our understanding of the big picture: humans are causing global warming.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "redplague", "channel": "UCtDIRCsIwsKpYCVY_FCUaBA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTtDPa9a9uiWOWvG3N1-yJfbdRL7dUGgGtgZp1a=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The graph separates Austria and Hungary into separate countries at times when they were one country, it lists Poland when it was divided up between Russia and Germany (ie: it didn't exist) and the Soviet Union (or it's constituent states) didn't exist until 1960.  Furthermore, it equates CO2 Emissions to responsibility for global warming.  Whilst Australia and the Netherlands (or Belgium) emit similar amounts of CO2, Australia (with its much larger land mass covered by vegetation) consumes far more CO2 than the Netherlands (or Belgium).  If you are going to equate global warming contribution to CO2 emissions, you also need to consider CO2 consumption.

In fact, the US overtook the UK while the UK still had the mass majority of it's \"empire\" intact! Think about that - The UK still had almost every single place they ever took over at their peak of dominance politically in the world, yet STILL got quickly surpassed by the US, while the US at that time had about 60% of it's current land & water claims.

Convert to parts per a million, since that is what it is usually measured in, and we have 5,000 ppm. Currently, according to the experts, our atmosphere has a little more than 400 ppm of CO2. Green house owners try to triple that to form a more ideal atmosphere for the growth of plants. In fact from the studies I have seen the benefit to plants only starts tapering off at somewhere between 3 to 4,000 ppm and CO2 levels don't even start making people drowsy until 10,000 ppm. The facts are that we could use at least 1,000 ppm more than we currently have for proper care for plants. \nIt isn't rising very fast either. Somewhere around 260 years ago CO2 levels were at around 280 ppm. Even with an exponential curve of increase we are unlikely to see more than a 50 ppm increase within the next 12 years. All of this can be verified. Farther, Based on fossil records and scientific analyses we know roughly what CO2 levels were thousands of years ago and what global average temperatures were over the same period. little to no correlation has been found between the two.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "The Roach of Theroachea", "channel": "UCn_LcfPeRn_6Fg3fMRoOgcw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTU4dqvdGfRH3H7R7zaVg8cy9n_kpm1CiwsG15-=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyO-yxHiT3-K4uxfVN4AaABAg", "text": "Global warming is a complete scam \nHere is the facts \n\n1. Record Ice\n\nIn 2014 there was¬†record sea ice in Antarctica¬†¬†in fact a global warming¬†expedition got stuck in it. Arctic sea ice has also made a nice¬†comeback in 2014. The Great lakes had record ice¬†Lake Superior only had 3 ice free months in 2014. You‚Äôd think that in the hottest year ever that ice would be melting like¬†Al Gore said.\n\n2. Record Snow\n\n2014 saw¬†record snowfall¬†in many areas, remember when they said that global warming would cause snow to disappear and¬†children won‚Äôt know what snow is.\n\n3. Record Cold\n\nIn 2014 we saw all kinds of¬†cold records¬†remember the¬†Polar Vortex?¬†You‚Äôd think that we‚Äôd be breaking all kinds of heat records in ‚Äúthe hottest year ever‚Äù\n\n4. Oceans Are Rising Much Less Than Predicted\n\nAl Gore predicted that oceans would rise 20 feet by 2100, it looks like were on track for about a foot. 80% of the tide gauges show less rise than the official ‚Äúglobal average‚Äù.¬†Many tide gauges show no rise in sea level, and almost none show any acceleration over the past 20 years.\n\n5. Polar Bears Are Thriving\n\nYou‚Äôd think that Polar Bears would really be in trouble in 2014 ‚Äúthe hottest year ever‚Äù but¬†they are thriving\n\n6. Moose Are Making A Comeback\n\nA few years ago the moose population in Minnesota dropped rapidly and they immediately¬†blamed global warming, then they¬†did a study¬†and found out it was actually wolves that were killing the moose. Wolves have been taken off the endangered species list and are now endangering other species so they opened a wolf hunting season in Minnesota and the moose are coming back. It turns out it had¬†nothing to do with global warming¬†in fact the years when the moose population declined were¬†some very cold ones.\n\n7. 99% of Scientists don‚Äôt believe in Catastrophic Man-Made Global Warming\n\nYou‚Äôve probably heard over and over that 99% of scientist believe in global warming well the¬†opposite is true.¬†That talking point came from a study where only¬†75 scientists said they believe¬†in global warming on the other hand over¬†31,000 scientists have signed a petition¬†saying they don‚Äôt believe in Catastrophic Man-Made Global Warming.\n\n8. Nature produces much more CO2 than man\n\nIn 2014 NASA finally launched a satellite that measures CO2 levels around the globe. They assumed that most of the CO2 would be coming from the industrialized northern hemisphere but much to their surprise it was coming from the¬†rainforests in South America, Africa and China\n\n9. It Isn‚Äôt Actually the Warmest Year.\n\nIf you look at the satellite data¬†2014 was not the warmest year ever¬†in fact there has been no global warming for over 18 years. The Reason they can say it‚Äôs the warmest year is because they are using the ground weather station data which is heavily influenced by the Urban Heat Island effect,¬†many of which are near pavement. Even still they had to cherry pick that data to get at the warmest year ever and it is only the warmest by only¬†two-100ths of a degree¬†within a dataset that has a variability of a half of a degree. The fact they they had to ignore accurate data and fudge sketchy data to push their agenda proves (IMHO) that climate change is a hoax.\n\n10. The Hypocrisy of the Main Players\n\nOne of the main reasons you can tell that global warming is a hoax is that the main purveyors of global warming live lifestyles opposite of what they preach, they all own multiple large homes and yachts and they fly around the world in private jets pushing their propaganda. Not to mention some people such as Al Gore actually profit from Carbon Taxes and other green energy laws. If they actually believed what they preached they would be leading quite different lives.\n\nThe truth is climate change is a complete scam big governments big businesses and the mainstream media are making a lot of money and power from brainwashing fear mongering people and the government and media are using global warming to distract people from real problems", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "chief aussie", "channel": "UCWVtjj4p-8bMZhrsjEK8yHg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSL9lv2UpJCcxRaujOzLs_d8UGYTlAGozyg_7Jl6Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

CO2 produced in the past has already been recycled multiple times. That's why it's called the carbon cycle.

The strongest economic countries, with the highest standard of living will out of necessity have the highest CO2 emissions. A vibrant economy demands energy - enormous quantities of it. Without energy, economies collapse and the standard of living collapses along with it. \n\nWind and solar are wholly inadequate for powering an industrial society, they are simply too expensive and consume way to much real estate. That basically leaves fossil fuels and nuclear - both which are under attack in the USA. \n\nChina's CO2 production has skyrocketed since 2001 and is now roughly double that of the USA. USA CO2 production continues to decline. China has its nuclear power generation plans back on track, with large numbers of new plants planned or already under construction. It is estimated than China will become the worlds #1 nuclear power producer within 10 years.\nThe trend is clear - the USA is on track for economic decline and decreased standard of living, while China is poised for exactly the opposite.

Each year in the month of May the CO2 levels peak, and then start to drop rapidly as vegetation begins to flourish with spring temperatures. The effect is most pronounced in the northern hemisphere because that is where most of the land masses (and vegetation) are. The opposite seasons on the southern hemisphere have little effect because of that fact. When you examine the seasonal declines on the curve you can that they are almost as large as the increases, so the only way that CO2 levels can continue to climb is through continued upward pressure. If that upward pressure is reduced beyond the rate of photosynthesis conversion, CO2 levels drop rapidly. This means that current CO2 emission levels which are producing the upward pressure are by far the most relevant to any upward trend.\nYou admit that the standard of living collapses without adequate energy sources to power it's economy. However the concern about food and shortages it completely based upon political/environmentalist fear mongering. There is absolutely no demonstrable negative correlation between warmer temperatures and food production or CO2 levels and food production. The undeniable fact is that exactly the opposite is true. It's not a fact that is even rationally disputable. More tropical areas with warmer temperatures and more rainfall have vastly greater vegetation growth rates and greater food production.

Yet new figures show a complicating development: China‚Äôs emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases may be rising again.\n\nChina ‚Äî which already emits more carbon from burning fossil fuels than the United States and Europe combined ‚Äî saw electricity use jump last year as its economy accelerated. Much of the extra demand was met by burning more coal, a particularly dirty fuel. Oil use has also risen as China has become the world‚Äôs largest car market, and so has natural gas consumption.\n\nExperts say one annual increase doesn‚Äôt indicate China is returning to an era when its emissions grew by leaps and bounds. But the increase illustrates the challenges and compromises Beijing must juggle if it wants to stoke its economy and at the same time keep its environmental promises.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Dave Can", "channel": "UCq5LR9H4P8bSW0Ia3buB4Gw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQasIK1E6qAwGfZyHJmzbjhywAFCFjSAqrDrA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Since I learned this I am dubious of any information that seeks to play down the huge carbon footprint of Middle Eastern oil-producing nations. The highest producers per capita are in the Mlddle East so the more we try to get USA, Canada, etc. to cut down the more the market is open for Middle Eastern oil producers to fill the gap and keep polluting.

This will not work on a larger scale. While it is true, products will become more efficient. Not at the rate I think you might believe. Electric motors are already around 95% thermal efficiency and the gains to be made are minimal Sure we will likely get new technology that completely changes the way a device works and makes it more efficient. But I do not think it will be earth shattering. And to coincide with that increase in efficiency, we are going to have an increase in demand. More things are going to use electricity, the vehicles will be one of he biggest users. One tesla vehicle charge is like charging your phone 4000 times.

Do you think Australia is entitled to the same emission as China? A logical and normal person would not think so. Second, China has been enforcing policies to reduce environmental issues, including smogs. Regarding recyclables and non recyclables, they still need to work hard to reduce plastic production and use, but nonetheless many aspects are moving on the positive size, which I also mentioned on a separate post. Here in developed nations, for so long we took things for granted and sent junks to developing nations. I am glad that China now refusing those junks, I think other developing nations should do the same.

That's why india holds 2.5% forest of the world,and ranked in top 10 countries of the world. India is countinously increaseing it's forest area along with development. India is having more rich biodiversity than any nation hold and also is having most fertile land for agriculture. Yes i admit that some cities are polluted like Delhi ,because of small land is used by large population using vehicles.

We are not that underdeveloped, y'know. Most of our pollution comes from cars etc because govt has long since cracked down on industrial pollution, akin to some west european countries, even though it has not been nullified. I don't think we will ever come to a point where everyone has a car. Lack of land and problems of scale. At most, we might double our total urban area in the next 30-40 years, and then slowly plateau.\nMeat is not that expensive here(especially chicken, what most eat). Some(Less than 25%) people are vegetarian because of religion, and most of these actually belong to the affluent class. Now historically we have been a dual agrarian-pastoral society, so the veganism could have springed from a desire to protect valuable livestock, also used in barter. We are, however, a food surplus nation. Always been barring some years in the British raj. Which is why the high population.\nWhen someone says a nation is unable to feed its people they normally mean a food deficit/population beyond the carrying capacity of the land. People here(mostly some farmers and labourers) go hungry because of absence of proper minimum wage, minimum price for crops, crops procurement processes, middlemen, lack of enough land holding to till, etc. These are iniquities mired in history and much more complex to solve.\n\nAnyway, so far India has been moving people straight to the service sector from the agro sector. If this pattern continues, there is nothing to worry. If it becomes a manufacturing hub, however, it does have the potential to supplant China as the largest polluter. I really hope and do not think that will happen. Because we at least have policies we have committed to and done some maths to let the world know what we will be doing in the bext decades, unlike some nations in the new world, which really pisses me off.\n\nI don't want to force an argument, but it is obvious that you don't know much about the unique circumstances/peculiarities of India, and yet want to give advice, however good intentioned that may be.

{"cid": "UgzFzCSEkxlriKqxi4l4AaABAg.8tUhoT-n9r_8vnRTgJi72d", "text": "¬†@Kyle Jones¬† You and I may have very different ideas of what good quality meat is. For a westerner, it would be well preserved, well certified, genetically modified(perhaps) meat. For me, it would be meat that is fresh and not unnecessarily pumped up with antibiotics and stuff(happens a lot in India). And it is pretty cheap and easily available. Almost all food in India is locally procured and fresh. We have a cultural predisposition against packaged food and it doesn't go at all with our cuisine. That may be the reason why packaged food is expensive here. At any rate, when the Indian market accepts a product, no matter how high the prices/costs are, they inevitably come rolling down a mountain. Countless prior examples.\n\n\nI never said cars won't increase. I said they won't substantially increase, cause unless they are able to fly, our roads cannot handle it. At any rate, we are already moving towards electric cars, albeit slowly.\n\n\nAs for what I said, I stand by it. A statement like that still makes me believe you don't have enough experience to understand the Indian narrative/perspective no matter how many times you have been here or how many books you have read. More subjectivity is required, as they say, feeling is half the knowing. The western perspective usually tends to be subjective when it comes to them, and objective when it comes to others. This is heavily biased, but unfortunately, this is the prevalent narrative right now due to the globalization of English. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n\nWe are actually not that intolerant/impatient/soft skinned towards criticism. However, we are tired after centuries of seeing our history misconceived then belittled, our existence perverted then wished away, our achievements minimised then whitewashed(exactly the point of this thread). Which is why we now demand an alternative worldview that places us in the anthropocentric seat of worldview, just as nations such as China or Japan have been able to establish. Call it an academic war, if you will. Whatever good we do, is belittled, whatever bad we do, is magnified. Otherwise why would people criticize a country that is a leader in tackling climate change and faces huge risks from it rather than countries who are not ready to skin single pennies of unearned exploitation? I don't understand the suspicion towards india, when people are gushing over how climate friendly Sweden is. Both countries are leaders in environmental policy making. However, no matter what Sweden does is not going to make a real difference. It's what countries like China, India, AND the US do that are going to make a difference. India's accomplishments in this field therefore, should be given more attention to, and the other two made to follow suit by public opinion.\n\n\nI know exactly what you mean. No extra pollution is good pollution, however small that may be, and India's emissions have definitely not peaked yet(we have been allowed till 2023, I think, to peak), but patterns of development are different for different countries. It is with good reason(China, Japan) that asian countries stress public transport rather than cars. It is cultural, there is a lack of natural resources and space available per capita, and problems, rather, advantages of scale, making public transport too affordable not to avail. The distances are short too, and there are a lot of other reasons. We are not a materialistic culture, and we can never afford to be, to sustain ourselves.\n\n\nThe definitions of modernity are also changing right as we speak. Frequent flights are not a marker of modernity(everywhere is not the US where places are too distant and passengers too few), and large, steam belching carbon factories have long ceased to be the ladders of development. Mobile phones, rather than computers rule the roost, and it seems like we are on the cusp of another industrial revolution. From that point of view, we are proud to be the largest data consuming country, and on the road to become a digital economy. New challenges in terms of environment are emerging, and it may have less to do with population. I don't think one should be too worried about carbon emissions anyway. We will probably fail our targets and them reabsorb the extra carbon somehow. Things like biodiversity loss are going to be bigger challenges in the coming days imo.\n\n\nAt any rate, we are a responsible nation. It is in our cultural spirit and even in our constitution to be a honorable and just nation.

How does it matter? Please explain.\n\n\nAbout roads, if you have been to old Indian cities, you'd know the constraints with space. We have nearly 57% arable land, and it is crucial it remains so. Forest cover must not decrease either. Where do we end up with urbanising? Yes, total urban land, length and breadth of roads will increase, but it will never get to the point where it can handle one car per citizen. Look at Japan, who have similar circumstances, and the focus on public transportation there despite being one of the richest and most evolved economies. Also, I never said all cars are going to change to electric tomorrow. 15-25 years would be an optimistic timeline.\n\n\nThink of me as an asshole if you would. Does not bother me. I'm not the one getting triggered and personally attacking people when things don't go my way. Anyway, I said all nations are quite dissimilar to all others, and the narrative that is dominant right now in academia is the anglo-american liberal one, due to various factors(triumph of capitalism, world wars, trade, english, democracy, etc), and this doctrine is home to people from GB and USA, often making them unable to identify with foreign ideologies, whereas people from everywhere else must acclimatize themselves with the anglocentric worldview as well as their home ideologies(nationalism for 2019 India, progress for the PRC, etc). That was why I said more subjectivity is needed. I never said Indian people shit gold/aren't subjective when it comes to their own country.\n\n\nCriticise when little Jack makes a mistake, encourage him when he makes a cute family drawing. That is the dictum maintained with every other nation in the world except India(and sometimes China). We simply can't catch a break. No matter what the elephant does, no matter how much it has a heart of gold, people will be suspicious. SImply because it has the potential to wreak havoc if it ever wanted. This is actually self fulfilling. Tell Jack everyday that he is the son of a thief, and chances are he will grow up to become one.\n\n\nIf what we do bad should be magnified, same should be applied to what we do well. Environment would be one of them(cleanliness and soil pollution aside). Especially when the other two biggies are being irresponsible. I never said India was the leader, but it is one of them. No bones with Sweden, but I was pointing at how much attention it(all scandinavian nations) receives, while India usually being 'shown its place'(like is happening here) despite both doing well.\n\n\nAgain, let me point my finger at Japan. They're rich, but a lot less materialistic than the USA. China on the other hand is more materialistic despite being poorer. National culture is indeed a thing. It could also be attributed to problems of scale, there being more people and less space. Whatever it is, nations industrialise differently.\n\n\nAbout phones/computers. You seem to think every problem has its roots in money/gdp per capita. The reason India chose mobile phones was the timing of the telecom revolution in India. Phones had already become the worldwide norm by then, and the role of computers is fast decreasing.\n\n\nEvery country, not just India, is on the cusp of an industrial revolution. Call it an information revolution, if that's what would make you look beyond the manufacturing sector. I. revolutions are also associated with paradigm shifts. One cannot judge/predict one with preexisting body of knowledge. No one would have guessed that Spain would fall and the tiny whimsical island nation called Engerland would change the world if they were left to work with only what knowledge was available before the 19th century. This is not to be overly optimistic/complacent, and other nations can as easily avail of the boons that are to come as India(despite having advantages like large population with lack of manufacturing depth/diversity, service expertise, etc). However, thinking the differences of today(gdp gap) will translate into differences of tomorrow almost completely identically, is the least to say, erroneous.\n\n\nI was not belittling the importance of reducing emissions. However, with the present international structure and public opinion, we are in no way going to be able to keep the carbon balance sheet even. However, technology is progressing in this sector pretty fast, so we may soon have the capacity to reabsorb carbon from the atmosphere. We are more lost when it comes to what to do with the rapid bio diversity loss that is going to begin soon.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "winter prince", "channel": "UCc6Y31OJz-8GsPu5plGrxsw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgK1Dgl-lMLOr0Qp33t-8QX00CP2zS4zmC1vJtdA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Wonder why there are highly developed agro products/ non meat food processing industries in India(milk, crops, cottage cheese, etc), but not meat? Not because of money. We as a race have an irrational aversion to frozen/packaged meat. Yes, people from affluent backgrounds use more processed foods in the above mentioned sectors, and money is a factor there, but rich and poor alike hate processed meat. Our cuisine is quite heavy handed/blunt, and while there is delicacy, there is absolutely no space for subtlety. Fine meat isn't a thing here, and not because of money. It's just not something we enjoy.\r\n\r\nEven in a highly developed state it won't be 1 car every 5 families.

The answer is both. One chooses to accentuate either the similarity or the difference. In this case, I chose the latter because you seemed to believe Indians will buy too much like say USA when they industrialise, which you latter said you didn't think. Again, look at Japan. Initially, they bought more, but it scaled down, and was never at the level of the US, despite being a much richer country.\r\nFYI, I have  the money, and still choose to live as mundane a life as possible. I roam around with slippers and two year old shirts :p It lets me slip under the radar and observe people rather than be observed, also allowing me to be self dependent, no matter what life throws at me.\r\nAlso, I don't get how self certification(I have traveled and seen it all) can substitute logic and well reasoned arguments in a debate.\r\nI never said India doesn't pollute. It pollutes quite heavily.\r\n\r\n\"You have been taught to hate the western world for a young age, because of history and how Britain dominated India for many years and then how USA have been causing wars  around the world for many years too. What they‚Äôve done has been wrong, no question about it but Indians carry an unbelievable grudge. Believe me, I‚Äôve experienced it first hand. \"\r\n\r\nThank god we have been subjected to that. Otherwise there would have been no one to remember all those who gave their life trying to win self determination. Even now, the world pays token respect to 'ghandi', and that's all they know about the Raj.\r\nAnyway, you are wrong. Everything here does not revolve around post colonialism. I have never been taught to hate the west(we aren't taught much world history in schools anyway) and I don't. I have also been subjected to internet rage from Brits who screamed at me that I should be thankful that their nation took up the 'white man's burden' and civilized our country, gave us english and railways and bla bla. I have been called streetshitter, Pajeet, etc. I don't go around thinking every brit is like that.\r\nNegative emotions are way stronger than positive ones, and nothing proves that more than yt comments section. It's a den of frustrated demons that will suck out any good vibes you ever had, and will leave you dry.\r\n\r\n\"You are actually so wrong. Who is punishing India? Please explain who? Britain has a significant Indian population, is it them? America is it then? France? Germany? Who? Who is it you speak of?? America has an issue with anyone, not India. Don‚Äôt think your country is special. No one has a problem with India at all, they are just a huge country that have a huge impact on the environment. \"\r\n\r\nYou misinterpreted punishment. In present world politics, punishment is criticism and negative propaganda. Just take a look at most available media/literature on India. It's overwhelmingly negative. The US decided to screw with the USSR post wwii with nothing but propaganda. Look where that left the USSR. Today everyone looks at Russia with suspicion(unless they are rabidly anti US like Serbia).

But either upper middle class or lower middle class. True middle class is fast becoming extinct. There's also a smaller, but big enough poor class, but they don't drive demand or consumption. They just produce things for no pay. This class does not have any class consciousness in the european sense(very specific exceptions aside-like farmer's agitations). They kind of admire the people above them, thinking they might be superior somehow to have gotten there and must have worked hard. So admiration+inferiority complex- a legacy of our history of casteism. At any rate, everyone, including even the most illiterate person, understands that there is limited resources to be shared by all, and the law of the land is supposed to be egalitarian. So the one that works the hardest gets it, no hard feelings involved. They are positive and motivate their children to achieve better futures for themselves.

The noveau riche are cool though, they don't hate the poor.\r\n\r\nAbout the actual street shitting, that used to happen 8-10 years ago. Migrant laborers who came to work in cities slept in the open at night and let go of their bladders on the streets in the morning. Now they still sleep under the sky/overcrowded lodging, but avail of public toilets in the morning.\r\nNow what's actually famous, is people letting go in the open/not in their bathrooms. Even two years ago when I caught a morning train I would see dozens of people squatting down if I looked outside in the wrong places(near villages or suburbs). Now I rarely see anyone do that, and I live in one of the northern states(West Bengal), so there's definitely been a sea change. Can't vouch for other states though.\n\n\n(I had to put it in notepad and reply thrice so it would go through lol)", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "winter prince", "channel": "UCc6Y31OJz-8GsPu5plGrxsw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgK1Dgl-lMLOr0Qp33t-8QX00CP2zS4zmC1vJtdA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's almost as if putin is salty and trying to give west the villain it has always portrayed russia as. It's an uncomfortable truth, but the west does regard russia like a looming danger, a strange, dark, looming place(paraphrasing from white tiger).\n\nAbout UK, yes, UK is a special case. Even during colonial times brits were fond of india. Now UK and South Korea are among the only major countries to have a positive image of India.\nThe rest of the west is a different story. You see, media is the propaganda maker in a liberal state, and unlike theory, it sometimes acts with one mind, with an incredible bias. Much credit of the fall of the USSR can be attributed to the US media/intelligentsia, other than the american state, and the misdeeds of the russian state itself. The media is supposed to act like a witness, but it acts like a really really provincial judge(including Indian media), and western media for the most part has an incredible bias against India. And media is what controls the academia in our days.\nAs Noam Chomsky said. Most journalists are honest, and they try to do their duty impartially. However, they still reach biased consensuses at the end of the day. Because if you are that much of a dissenter, you are never going to reach the station of a journalist.

This means that in 1983, Belgium had polluted as much as India since 1880 because Belgium is an industrialized country since the 19th century and not India. This video compares the total CO2 emissions since 1880, not current emissions.\nToday, China is the biggest polluter of the world in front of the United States and India is third. China and India appear far behind in this video because they are countries that industrialized in the second half of the twentieth century, a century after the Westerners.\n\r\nIndonesia pollutes today much more than France or Italy and yet, she is not even in the top 20 for the same reasons.\n\n\n\rIn fact, Europeans pollute less today than in 1990 while Chinese and Indians have multiplied their pollution by 5 in the same time.
