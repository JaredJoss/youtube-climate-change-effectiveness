{"cid": "UgxybohDqoyGznn7Tlt4AaABAg", "text": "The problem with global warming \"theory\" is they go with the worst case scenario every time. It's a \"it bleeds it leads\" function of the media. The catastrophe for profit crowd feed off it and use it to get rich, they are climate grifters like Al Gore like Al Sharpton is with race relations. They never help the problem, they make it wore for profit.\n\nIf people understood how climate modeling worked, they would see the flaw inherent. They take base data from what they consider \"reliable\" (back to that later). Plug it into a simulator that they designed, that may have inherent flaws/bias they don't know about (or do). Then they ask the computer model to take that raw data and run it forwards, postulating on possible outcomes. They ask for 3 solutions, the least radical i.e. low end variances, the most likely and then the most unlikely but plausible. Which scenario do you think the press reports on as \"scientists say!\" stories? If you said plausible but not likely, give yourself a cookie. Remember, it bleeds, it leads. Nobody is going to tune in at 10pm to see a story that says \"scientists say the climate it going to be a big yawner for the next 100yrs .02 F temp rise predicted.\"\n\nAbout that reliable sources data. There is a scientific practice that says to get as close and raw a data as you can. In essence, go to the well to get the water, don't have the water brought to you. Contamination can happen, even inadvertently. So, climatologists and the weather prediction industry, over the years have been putting satellites in orbit and on site monitors to gather that data. But they don't get the data raw, they pay researchers to act as aggregators, people that gather the shear bulk of data and distill it to a recognizable form. So years ago, a honest professor noticed a problem in the data provided. He tried to get the raw data handed to him to compare his research results against. The aggregator wouldn't provide it. They hemmed and hawed about it and just never had the time. So he decided to go to the source. He got off his ass, bought plane tickets, 4 wheelers, donkeys and backpacked into these remote areas and uploaded the raw data into his own computer right from the detection devices and moved along to the next. He started to notice something startling. That starting at a certain point in time, the data provided for his research and the climatologists started to trend away from the raw data, that what was fed them was false. that there was in fact a bigger and bigger disparity between the reality and the fact data they had been fed the closer to the now you got. YIKES! Like all computer models, garbage in, garbage out. If the base data is wrong, the model can only be more wrong. \n\nIf you want to know more specific what happened, its called the hockey stick phenomenon. A data gatherer was a \"climate change/Global warming\" zealot. He just \"knew\" that the global temps were rising and something had to be done now, that since the ends justified the means he needed to act, so he decided to \"change\" the data to reflect his belief. When the professor returned, he reported the discrepancy.....nothing, crickets. Nobody wanted to know why there was a difference from reality and the data they was using. So he filed a complaint and another and another, told a story about it in prominent scientific journals and Voila! a name got spit out. The guy that had been entering the fraudulent data got outed. FINALLY some of the science journals started to ask questions, he featured prominently. What was his response? \" \"Oh ,well\" in essence. Yeah, Mr. I got caught at it, so sure I cheated, but I had to because my cause is so important that it's ok to cheat, admitted it. And? nothing. they quietly moved him to some other tenured position, didn't acknowledge the models were all wrong because of it and moved on. so all the GLOBAL WARMING! that was going on in the 80s and 90s? It wasn't. So they moved on to CLIMATE CHANGE! to continue the grift.

The only people you can actually trust on the issues of global warming is NOAA. Why NOAA? Because they have literally pioneered all the research behind it from the beginning.\n\nThat being said, the research conducted by NOAA has shown that there has been a significantly large amount of destruction on the ozone layer caused by the over-emission of CFCs and Carbon Dioxide. As a result the UV rays emitted by the sun penetrate the atmosphere, which affects the algae population in rivers and lakes, which in turn kills and mutates the algae causing red tides to form. Red tides, if you don't know, are concentrated bodies of water that when an organism ingests is potent enough to kill in seconds, this includes any form of carbon based life form and usually when created, fish end up dead on the shore. Obviously not something to want to swim in.\n\nThis is why it's important that you take care of your skin and make sure that before you head outside in a sunny day you wear sunscreen lotion. The effects of the damage to the atmosphere has even been shown to harshly affect truck drivers who spend a lot of time underneath the sun, even forming harsh facial deformations on one side of their faces due to prolonged exposure to the sun on a certain part of their face.\n\nYou might be asking how I know all of this, well I used to work with the satellites used to produce data that proved the correlations I just described, and the satellite I worked with was the LISCO satellite (The Long Island Sound Coastal Observational platform). The question begs, how can you repair this damage? Well we will just have to wait until electricity no longer exists, and personally I see no reason to care so long as we have an abundance of skin care protection with SPF, just my 2 cents.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Ollicron", "channel": "UCrv_uMDtsui_ofAwAuhDWPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEGNykC-AWpaEt1N4EUQF81SiegCIGGInWey70=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That's what Michael Knowles does. He challenges unprepared college students and others that haven't done their research and then when they can't effectively argue for the position they're advocating for he declares victory. Have you ever seen him post a well crafted argument made by an articulate and informed person with whom he disagrees? No? That's by design. There are many tens of thousands of people in positions of authority at universities, think tanks, politicians and others that can make the case for positions with which he disagrees and you will never see them engaged in a thoughtful and intelligent debate. \nWhat is the harm in global warming? 1. Rising sea levels threatening the lives and domiciles of fully 2/3 of the worlds population that lives along the coasts of global land masses. 2. The release of CO2 currently frozen in the ocean, which would be a global catastrophe if enough were released, but it would/could a global extinction event. 3. Shifting weather patterns would be a veritable coin flip as to whether there would be a drought in all of North America & snow in the Mohave Desert in the long term, or just extreme examples of current weather like the worsening of hurricanes in TX and FL in the short term. 4. Loss of ice shelfs and rising sea temperatures are reducing habitats & putting pressure on life forms that are linked to the global food supply, animals and humans alike - Polar bears are losing their hunting grounds in the \nartic; as plant die off, fish leave causing seals to leave and last Polar bears starve to death. Krill are dying in the Antarctic, which then affects the entire food chain. That's just two small, but important examples and there are many more. There are probably a dozen or more other issues that global warming is affecting. Just because one nervous, young and possibly less than well prepared student can't come up with examples on the fly is no reason to dance a victory dance.

{"cid": "Ugw9d_-nmiQT6KfXwkh4AaABAg.9MKMKNhhMqL9MjgZdKW3e3", "text": " @Earl Warner  First of all, I apologize for being insulting. Genuinely - I resolved to not be an a@@hole online and broke my own rule.\nThe Permian and Triassic extinctions (especially the latter) weren't the result of Pangea coming together - Pangea was already there, and rather, started to break apart. The latest idea is this (I think): you have a super-continent and a super-plume forms beneath it (you should check this out yourself, it's really, really interesting!). The super-plume reaches the crust, which acts as a barrier, and the plume spreads out in all directions, taking the land masses with it. The crust thins out and cracks start to appear. Absolutely, there are violent eruptions - it's not a peaceful process, you don't want to be anywhere near such a thing. Over 100,000 years (in the Permian case), the lavas build up, and so does the CO2 (along with a bunch of other gases). A tipping point is reached, positive feedbacks kick in - melting permafrost, glaciers, and deep see methane ices - and then the climate shifts, fast. Seriously, check it out, they've nailed down the timelines to within thousands of years, it all fits. Furthermore, there IS no evidence for an alternative explanation.

The planet is always changing, and will continue to change years after humankind is extinct. The reason I bring politics in it is because our “virtuous” Left are the ones who co opted the global warming initiative in order to slip through their congressional wishlist under the guise of “virtuosity”, and for power of course. That’s not “brainwashing”, that’s reality. \nI’ve watched the Left operate in this manner for several years now. And mankind’s influence on the planet is the equivalent to that of a nat on a freight train.  And even worse, we have many with the audacity and gall to believe we can directly control or manipulate the Earth’s ecological patterns.  \n\nIdc if you’re 88 or 18 years old, surely you’d have enough sense to know that at least. The modern Left is showing unprecedented levels of arrogance never thought possible. And fwiw, most of the people gung-ho about climate change have been misguided in the exact same fashion you’ve claimed me to be. If the “virus of unknown origins” showed us anything, it’s how government and scientific agencies can be heavily partisan and politically influenced. Or, purposefully silenced if they don’t have the “right” findings. \n\nThe GOAT George Carlin once said something to the extent of…. “don’t worry about Earth, it’s us who aren’t going to be around for long.”", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Kenny Beans", "channel": "UCm9aA5s-X88MVNMwyEBvxaw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQwmUpU6VqwHwfH3EgHG2Ewyhqb_CA_o9CcB8VK=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you want to leave your act (because I can't believe that you actually are so stupid that you can't understand the science, so it must be an act), you can start educating yourself by looking at the videos of Potholer54. He has a good one on why conservatives deny climate change and how we can make them change their minds.

At all. Two degrees is practically nothing.\nThere was research conducted on ice cores from the polar regions a few years ago. They found that the time lag between CO2 and global temperatures is around a few thousand years (at least 80,000 years), so if you buy into the Left's argument, there's simply no way to prove if they're right.\nRenewable energy is ridiculous at best - inherently unreliable, very destructive to the environment and looks spectacularly ugly - 🏠 with solar panels on their roofs are uglier than a three-week-dead rotting bull carcass.\nThe Left's claim that 97 percent of scientists agree on this false idea being true is a blatant lie.\nThe Left are completely bonkers.\nWhoever writes those awesome puns in the title and description deserves a raise.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Mile Sipka", "channel": "UCgQN5EwZjjujp3p_EkO0S7w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRLOrggyFvCWoqQEzXEIlfpI1SVjv23CKZZyTHL5Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Genuine environmentalism isn't about putting mankind last; it just acknowledges the precious, and irreplaceable nature of our world. If you are Christian (as I am), it means you acknowledge that Man will never rival the handiwork of God, and so we should respect it. If you are rational, and not morally blind, it means that you are able to acknowledge that we reside on a contained sphere that, although large, is still contained and is currently being devastated by a human population that numbers in the billions and keeps on rising.

First off, the petty tactic of using human biology to make an analogy towards climate change is ridiculous as it is an invalid comparison. Second, you are technically right about us being made of atoms... Trouble for you is that we are all made of CARBON atoms (unless you're an alien from Star Trek), therefore every living thing is constantly emitting and absorbing carbon all the time. To that point, \"carbon neutral\" is absurd as it is technically impossible to EVER be that as even when you're dead, your remains are still trading carbon with the environment. Regardless of the speed in which emissions are rising, our dear planet Earth has a very efficient regulatory system in place to keep us comfortable - the plants and 🌲 of the world. They need CO2 to survive and the more CO2 they get, the stronger they grow (have you ever checked satellite photos of our forests from space? They're literally getting greener!), ironically helping us humans survive because as they breathe in the CO2, the 🌲 create oxygen for us to survive on. While I'm all for protecting the planet we live on, the Left's climate crusade is designed purely to use the environment as a tool to enable them to take over the world and install a global socialist government.\nThird, the renewable energy sources the Left champion as the world's saviour is hypocritical since the resources needed to make solar panels and those useless, ugly-ass, bird-killing wind turbines are causing much greater destruction to the Earth than coal could ever do. Not to mention that solar and wind are inherently unreliable at best. And there's no jobs in this industry so anyone spruiking employment opportunities out of the renewables industry is quite frankly shitting through their dope-stained teeth.\nAnd lastly, considering that the Climate Mafia are a subdivision of the Socialist Left - an organisation dedicated to committing racism, bigotry and hardship while pretending to fight those very things, not to mention being responsible for the deaths of at least 100 million people (the historical death toll of socialism), I'm not going to accept a lecture from a member of that evil group.\nTo the people of the Left, I say this: you have no integrity, no conviction, nothing.

I learnt a great deal about the environment and about how the Earth's systems worked. Back then the Left had not manifested itself into that absurd climate cult that exists today. I also did an awful lot of personal study on various science topics (I even scored highly in a science competition back in primary school so science is something that I have a deep interest in.\nWhen did you go to school? Sometime in the late 2000s or 2010s when the Left have infiltrated schools worldwide and initiated their false narrative? I know more about how the world works than you ever could, as your belief is so wrong that it really makes me disappointed at the abysmal quality of the \"education\" that young people get these days. You are really an object of pity...\nBut to answer to your reply, consider this. Carbon neutral DOES NOT exist. Never has, never will, for the reasons I have previously mentioned. Sure, you can eat plants that are made of carbon, that sucked in the air before you ate it, but the reality is that EVERYTHING on this planet is giving off and absorbing carbon at the same time so your argument is essentially saying that \"black is the opposite of white so therefore it is a type of grey\". If that sounds ridiculous to you then you've caught a glimpse at how stupid YOUR argument is.\nAs for renewables being less destructive than coal, don't make me laugh. If you bothered to check how solar panels and wind turbines are manufactured and saw the way that making them costs the environment, then you'll see that your rebuttal of my point about the renewables being so bad is just plain ill-informed at best.\nI have a very strong mind and do not get easily swayed into joining causes. I take the time to examine something and if it fits my beliefs then I'm for it.\nAs for you, your petty attempts at disproving me are just plain pathetic. The Left are champions of stupidly and arrogance. Even you labelling me a 'flat earther' is pathetic as you don't even know what the term really stands for (just another useless leftie term that they use to attack anyone they don't like). The Left have this weird way of discrediting anyone who disagrees with them by labelling them stupid things that only shows how ignorant the Left really are.\nThere is no catastrophic climate change. The world won't end by 2030, or 2130, or even 2230 (unless nuclear war or an asteroid impact occur - always a possibility). As for being brainwashed, well go look in a mirror. Many of the Left's rabid followers have been recruited by bring brainwashed. Not just that, but the reason they are against free speech is because they know their cause is bogus and by preventing anyone questioning them, they protect their cause.\nBTW, the corals are actually regenerating faster than they're bleaching. And extreme weather events are getting less frequent than in previous decades. Wait until 2030 comes around and you'll see I'm right and you're wrong.

Just because I only have two subscriptions doesn't mean I only watch two channels - I watch a lot of stuff, it's just I don't usually subscribe to them unless it's absolutely necessary. And your little claim that fossil fuels are ending, well we'll see about that. Like I previously mentioned, this climate change argument has been used by the Left to initiate their world takeover plan. To say that I got my info from a different channel is just part of your arrogant ignorance - I already explained what I studied in high school and you clearly didn't understand that. I get my info from various sources. The solar and wind generation sector is absolutely hopeless - the massive blackout that South Australia suffered a few years ago was caused by wind power (the storm caused the wind turbines to overgenerate and caused the state's power grid to collapse). If you choose to believe that renewable energy sources are going to save mankind, that's your choice, but that doesn't mean you're necessarily right. Solar and wind generation might be getting popular now, but when countries replace their trusty and reliable fossil fuel generators with those pathetic solar and wind generators, we'll see massive blackouts and various other catastrophes happen, which will cause people to die. It's already happened in South Australia (and recently in Texas as well) and the very fact that renewables are unreliable due to their very nature (solar doesn't work at night and wind turbines need strong winds to work, which presents its own issues) means that YOU are the one who is radical.\nTo be honest, I don't blame you for that, the Left have completely brainwashed scores of young minds into believing this climate change crap. Just don't make assumptions about the people who disagree with your point of view.

At one point they were saying (gore I believe) that sea level would rise 35 feet and we haven't seen it. I grew up in Virginia Beach. Right on the ocean. I've live or visited that area for around 40 years now. Almost half of the 100 year prediction scale. You know how much the water has risen in that time? I don't either, because you can't even tell that it has even if it has. So these predictions of 12-35 foot sea level rises are likely B.S. as far as I can tell. I'd wager that they are \"political\" estimates. Meaning that, they are floated to the public to incite a specific reaction so that the politicians or the scientists can get something else done. So, that what they do is create a model with all the worst case scenarios built in and out pops 35; or 12'. \nWhen did the 100 year scale start? I know they have been saying 100 years since at least 2000. Now its 20 years later. 12' in 100 years would equal about 2.5' sea level rise already and if that happened many of our coastal cities would already be flooded. I lived in Florida, along the coast, for a few years. I'm going there on Monday. I'd wager the intercoastal waterway that I will be near will be at the same height as it was 15 years ago when I was living on it.\n\nWhen you ask Knowles to stick to what he knows I must simply ask, \"what do you really know?\" Are you a climate scientist or are you regurgitating what some has told you is true?

I didn’t give a specific year because since the late 80s, that specific date continues to change. Once we reach the previous prediction for when our coasts will be under water or the polar caps will be ice free or we won’t be witnessing snowfall anymore, they change said date. This has happened a half dozen times now. The scientists who believe that we go through natural cycles, I’ve found not to be funded by government. Both hypothesis have not been proven, we do not know what is going on with our climate, which they fail to say when making such claims. The government funded studies also claim the sun not playing a major role in our climate. I’m no scientist by any means, but that just seems ludicrous to say given that the sun literally affects everything here on earth. To me, the sun having major affects on our weather AND climate, just seems like logical common sense. But their climate prediction models show little if no interference by the sun. This is a HUGE problem with the hypothesis of human activities being the main driver of our climate. Once the models include the sun being a bigger driver to our climate over human activity, then we will finally see the true state of our climate and what it means going forward.

I can feel the difference in my lungs in a city compared to when I’m in the countryside because of the decrease in air pollution for example. This isn’t made up - it’s a health related issue caused by air pollution we have created with our vehicles. You put your face on an exhaust pipe and you’ll get poisoned - I’m hoping no one contests this or that these poisons in the air are doing us damage. I also am saddened by the amount of trees and habitats being destroyed to take resources for various industries, the mini earthquakes and instability of the land caused by fracking (particularly in small residential areas like the north of England). With the lack of these trees I would assume we’d have less oxygen in the air and, as informed by David Attenborough’s documentary an increase in rodent populations which leads to increase in disease (possibly like corona virus) which obviously damages the health of the human population. I’m not commenting to catalyse any kind of hate and have actually begun the slow process of moving from the left to the right, spurred on by these videos which I’m enjoying. But I still cannot see past the environmental issue and do not understand why if we can put money (the same money that has been used on fossil fuels, cutting trees, mass farming etc) and slowly transition it towards new forms of fuels, resources, products that seems to have less of an impact on the environment, even if we are unsure of what the impact or long term consequences will actually be - isn’t investing on the doubt worth it? Even financially speaking. It’s certainly proved lucrative for people like Tesla. Again, really wanting an answer on this, one I can get on board with, that makes sense to me.

If we for example burned down all of our forests we’d stop having air to breathe. He simultaneously says conservatives are conservationists while saying the earth is here to serve us. No. The earth was here first & will be here long after you. It doesn’t need you you need it, for everything. You exist because your human being can exist within its ecosystem. That is THE stupidest thing I’ve ever heard him say or anyone say, so entirely selfish. Where did it get that answer - a book. So out of touch with why we’re here. Nature is not here to serve us you absolute buffoon. That is the most arrogant, out of touch & entitled things I’ve ever heard. It’s not quasi-spiritual to help a planet. It is better stated that you AND the planet would be better if you kept a relationship with it that is deeper than how you speak. You aren’t in charge of earth, you are a tiny part of a web. To state this would mean you are against eco systems. And to state this shows such a fundaMENTAL misunderstanding of our planet. I am native, Jewish. And proudly white. I was on left this year and left it forever after they burned my city. But this is the side of a conservative that doesn’t understand nature’s law and doesn’t ever win me over, nor could it ever & it’s why the right turn people off. It’s out of touch with the spirit. I’m not saying global warming does or does not exist due to humans but that statement is absolute idiocy and it acts as if it’s shameful to cater to a planet that you came from, that you aren’t BETTER than and that literally provides everything you’ve ever seen or eaten or known. You like them to look nice over there but also eat them? What arrogance & entitlement to act as if you were born to own it all just because you were born. I hope I never pretend to have the answers just to fit inside of the boxes one side gives me as the case. Especially if it’s just because it was told to me by some outside source. The Bible is just a book that plagiarizes and represents allegories that are much older. A man with a beard in sandals who somehow lives in the sky didn’t write it. Like... he didn’t. We are meant to learn from nature, not control it.  Respect what anyone chooses to believe internally and for their own life. But this man thinks small if that’s what he thinks. We cannot mandate another’s personal refuge of the self but it is so clear to me how little this man knows nature, not on graphs or studies on global warming ... but really personally knows it. You’re part of a sacred hoop my man, not the master plucker. If you were the master plucker of this web you’d be writing what happens, you’d be able to make yourself immortal, you’d be able to look better than you do or different. You’d be able to change the code you come with. But you can’t. Because you aren’t the master. You are a person born and who will die and needs to work on his arrogance. Go into nature instead of teaching impressionable kids about a topic that you clearly just showed you know nothing about. What I wish for the Conservative party is that they could stop relying so much on this idea that they can just shoot and hunt and kill and go to church on Sundays. To be fair I don’t care who goes to church on Sunday’s but there’s more to these lessons than the answer you just gave and I so want to see the left crash and burn and fail for how evil it has become, how much it manipulates. But this untouchable arrogance from a place of no understanding of your own meaning (cus someone already taught you this meaning I’m guessing from a book?) does nothing for your party or life or cause. It keeps you small and it will never win over youth or be as powerful as if you got in touch with true spirit. Spirit of land, spirit of self, of animals and gods and nations and learned nature’s law. This year I’ve aligned with the right even though I am not religious and even though I don’t personally attend a church. But I just hate when I see stuff like this. It reminds me of those dumb guys at parties that crush cans on their head because it’s manly. It’s not unmanly to be spiritual or to know the earth. It’s sad that anyone taught that it was to you. Especially by a church or book. There’s a balance in all. The right is too conservative sometimes and the left has gone insane. Moderacy Michael, not arrogant one liners. We all have room to grow. You sound like you need better teachings and a little humbling yourself. If you do believe in a god and if that God is Jesus he wouldn’t say oh yeah well I like them to look pretty over there in the field and I also like to shoot them because all is here to serve meeeeeee. And if he did say that he’d be wrong. And if people don’t see how leftist that very line is “me me me me meeee, cuz I feel like it” then that’s silly. Sorry Michael. Both sexes have to grow.

There is geological evidence from ice core samples AND ground core samples that show we have had several \"Ice Ages\" and it's an ONGOING PROCESS!!!  The Earth warms up until the atmosphere is so thin that the vegetation burns (or a catastrophe like an asteroid, volcanic eruption, etc.) and the sun is blocked out, causing an Ice Age.  The smoke or ash then slowly dissipates, allowing the Earth to slowly warm again.The warming causes the ice to melt, fast at first, then more gradually.  The melting ice causes water vapor to collect in the air and help reform the atmosphere.  Global Warming is natural and will always happen whether we are here or not.

More than 10 000 fires. Go and figure it out how much is for those 24 people.\" I may be misunderstanding this, but it seems to me you're claiming 24 people couldn't start that many fires, while lightning strikes can. Did lightning strike 10,000 times? Or is it possible there weren't 10,000 different points that fire started from?\n\nAlso, no need to worry about CO2.

There's actionable solutions to those above mentioned problems.\n\nFor the mainstream theory of GW which you seem to believe, it's a political tool used to get more tax money and funnel it to crony friends through various schemes while doing barely anything tangible to actually reduce problems like pollution and habitat destruction.\n\nI was taught about global warming in school just like everyone else. I studied it and looked into it like everybody else. Then I did more research. The CO2 theory is bunk. Water (cloud formation) and solar particles have a greater control over our global temperature as clouds are the biggest greenhouse has by a long, long way. Solar particles lead to cloud formation. There's evidence showing the whole solar system is warming up at the moment which gives greater credence to the influence of the sun.\n\nIf the people who push the GW narrative - such as Greta - really cared about the CO2 produced, they just need to look at the stats of which country produces the most CO2.

{"cid": "Ugy40x4m6AZEQWf1hxN4AaABAg", "text": "The proposed catastrophies:\n\nWarmer temperatures -- Nearly everyone would prefer to live on a warmer planet than a colder one.  How many people go out of their way to own a 2nd home so they can \"snowbird\" and avoid colder weather?  Far, far more cold related deaths occur in the current climates than heat related deaths.\n\nThe end of coffee --  Of course not!  Might have to grow it in Canada in the future.  Obviously exaggerating.\n\nFlooding -- Any \"increase\" in flooding is caused by more and more growth and development.  DO NOT build mere feet from the ocean.  DO NOT build right next to a river you know 100% for fact will flood someday.  We have the ability to plan and control to some extent water.  We build reservoirs, canals, drainage systems, pumps, walls, etc.  Many Pacific islands and places like Miami are experiencing more flooding, but these places are measurably SINKING.\n\nSea level rise -- current rates are about one foot per 100 years.  I'm not going to double everyone's taxes, take control of the government, and force every citizen in the civilized world to change their habits over one foot that even my toddler won't see in his lifetime.\n\nIncreased number and intensity of hurricanes and tornadoes -- We aren't seeing this.  We might actually be seeing a downtrend, but I won't jump to that conclusion over a small data set.\n\nThe end of snow -- Nope.  Canada and much of the USA has seen several recent winters with increased snows, not less.  Even Australia started their last winter with record snows.\n\nThe end of rain, increased droughts -- Hmm, we just aren't seeing this.  A lot of places that have been in drought went drought-free this last year.  Doh!  I live in Colorado, and we ended last season without a single acre of land being in drought.\n\nStarvation -- Plants are our food.  They THRIVE on CO2.  They grow faster with more CO2.  They die with less CO2.  I don't see a problem here.  NASA considers 8000 ppm CO2 to be dangerous in the ISS.  Less than 100 ppm, and life on earth will die.  I see no issue with 400 ppm.\n\nOcean acidification -- That is 100% NOT POSSIBLE, and is just a made up scary term.  The ocean is basic, and is slightly, slightly trending toward being more neutral.  I don't remember the exact numbers without looking things up but I think the ocean is around 8.4 pH.  An acidic ocean would have to be below 7.0 pH.  Experiments with grossly multiplied CO2 levels showed the ocean has a way of fighting off pH change and would balance around 8.2 pH.\n\nDid I leave any out?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Colorado 450L", "channel": "UCYEdElW5zWDY6qTwkqWPbcQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQxrDlFB077olhZsAMJvaX9pb25IhUSLwK-eQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes, the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere does influence temperature, but it's a tiny fraction of climate change. Clouds have way more influence in the cooling and warming of surface temperatures than CO2 does. The problem everyone seems to ignore whether be for or against the man made climate change, which is increasing temperatures is actually good for our planet, not worse. Plants grow bigger and greener the higher the levels of CO2 are, this is settled science. We artificially increase CO2 in a closed and controlled environment so plants grow bigger and faster, it's called a greenhouse. CO2 is one of the most important things in our planet, and we're trying to eliminate it?\n\nJust before China and India had their technological boom, our planet registered around 180 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere. 150 ppm is the beginning of the death of plants. They've convinced us all that CO2 is evil, when it's food for plants. All life in this planet are carbon based. Plants need CO2 to produce oxygen. Why are we being told 1 or 2 degrees warmer would be catastrophic? Look at our planet, it's greener now with around 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere than it was +10 years ago when we were at around 180 ppm. More CO2 is good. We could really boost up CO2 levels to 800 ppm and only get a rise of 1 degree Celsius global. 1600 ppm for a 2 Celsius increase. 3200 ppm for a 3 Celsius increase.\n\nWe've got more pressing issues than burning fossil fuels. We have incredible waste and no idea what to do with it. Plastic is an epidemic and our oceans are filled with it.

So you mean to tell me that 5-6% of 0.04% is changing our weather enough to be an alarmist?  We are in an interglacial period, and 20K years ago Boston was under 2 miles of ICE.  For the last 1-2 Million years our CO2 levels, which averaged level over 2000 PPM have been steadliy decreasing.  Our planet is NOW and HAS BEEN for the last 10-20K  years been sitting at PLANETARY LOWS for both CO2 and Temp.  THANK GOD we went from 200-400 PPM in the last century.  Plants exploded on this planet when we were at our average of 2500 PPM.  Pump CO2 into a greenhouse and you get much bigger plants.  Tell me, what would have happened had we gone down from 200 PPM?  Hint, something socialists do very well......death, starvation, and despair.\n\n\nOur planet is CO2 STARVED!  Europe and US have dropped their CO2 levels over the last 20 years, yet the CO2 levels have still skyrocketed thanks to mostly China and India.  As a result, the earth has gotten about 10% greener in the last 15 years (per NASA).  This is during a time when the RAW (not the adjusted and fake) temp data has CLEARLY shown that temps have flattened the last 20 years.  Why?  Because we are in a solar cycle of low solar activity.  IF anything, you better PRAY for global warming becuase when the next solar maunder minimum comes  in solar cycle 26...we might see temps drop significatly.  \n\n\nCO2 is a trace gas and if you google 600 million year temp and CO2 charts, you will see that it follows temps.  Why?  Because as the sun warms our oceans it releases most of the CO2 that hits our atmoshphere.  The rest  of the 95% that doesn;t come from man comes from rotting vegetation and other sources.  Our orbit, Cocmic rays, planetary tilt, magnetic field, along with the biggest culprit culprit our SUN have everything to do with our weather. CO2 has almost no impact.  \n\n\nLEARN SCIENCE people.

Is the planet warming? Absolutely. Is it warming at an alarming rate? It doesn't appear to be. Could humans cause climate shifts? It's feasible but where's the data that shows we're already influencing it? Where's the cause and effect of greenhouse gasses? And if greenhouse gasses are such a problem, why are we fostering entire plant life conservations in green houses? Don't plants thrice on carbon? And if plant life grows and carbon emissions somehow lead to upticks in temperatures, won't more plants eventually scrubs the air of the carbon? The planet is brilliantly built to neutralize itself over time. It takes a lot of time but it happens. Meanwhile, are we really worried about 2° C increased Temps over the next 200 years? Won't that just lead to warmer climate? And where would warmer climates be observed? Certainly not globally because we know the equatorial zone doesn't fluctuate from season to season like the poles do. So if the poles warm a but and melt a little ice off, is it so bad? After all, few cities are built so foolishly that a few inches up in sea levels could actually destroy anything.

{"cid": "UgzNSQgWKrEp4O48n0h4AaABAg.9-ygD2LPg7U90KAsPCWrSX", "text": " @Daniel R  By proxy you did, and you're missing my overall point.  First, the article and the movie didn't just spring to life in a vacuum.  Both are based off of \"science\" at the time.  Those who present it are not the progenitors of the \"data/research\", the scientists who compiled the \"data/research\" are, as they came to the conclusions that were presented, not the person who is presenting it.  Regardless, they were all proven false, as they have been contemporaneously.  Second, because the presenters do not have the credentials you require or are not jumping through the hoops that you deem necessary, what they say has no validity one way or the other.  I sort of agree, only because they all, even the modern ones, claim to have science on their side, yet all have been completely debunked without making the argument from authority.  Regardless, your premise is still false because of the whole \"argument from authority\" thing I explained, that somehow this modern iteration of doomsday prophecies are true because the people who claim it have certain letters after their name or have degrees in the field/fields that you accept as authorities on the matter.  That's patently and demonstrably untrue. The \"global cooling\" thing in the 70's (yes, it was a thing, look it up) had the same \"science\" claiming the same thing.

So possibility for floods and at some place to fall  extreme amount of rain is substantially higher.\n\nAlso at places that have dry seasons, when they last they are more intense because higher temp. extremes.\n\nClimate change intensifies all those things, like floods, droughts and hurricanes. \nHurricanes are more stronger because water is warmer, and hurricane extract energy from ocean water, warmer=more energy.\n\nAlso 30% of our CO2 emissions are dissolving every year in ocean water so water is more acidic every year, ocean acidification.\nThis have effect on living things in ocean.\n\nThe, problem with this warming is SPEED of change, it's very fast, it's 9 times faster than ice age recovery time.\n\nAlso CO2 in air is rising 40 times faster than what is normal natural fluctuation.\nCO2 in air is 50% higher today than before industrial revolution and is going up about 1% per YEAR, this is extremely fast.\n\nEcosystems can't adapt so fast, evolution do not work that fast, so we have today much faster spices extinction than what is normal.\n\nClimate do not CAUSE fires but when fire is starter (arson, natural cause like dry thunderstorms etc) they burn lot more land.\nYou have example for California, In 2019 4000 detected fires and this year almost 7000 fires but this time land burned is 30 times bigger.\nReason is extreme droughts.\n\nSearch on wikipedia what is dry thunderstorms .\n\nWhat is important to notice is when you have arson fires those are mostly in rural areas and detected early and can be much more effectively put down.\n\nWhen you have wild fire in wild areas far from firefighters approach and not detected early those fires can grow in size of megafires .", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Kloko Loko", "channel": "UCTjA6jHHcAVRQY2dJSHscaQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRMtnoxfu_eKMhZE6R3QUbeZRFtVfY4ImiLqe3M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugypz-5sfVGhmTgdRNl4AaABAg.9-wUeQlW41U9ExVvEHP613", "text": " @Wesley  1) I just pointed that cause of fire is not important if you have dry condition and I gave you an example of 2019 and 2020 in California \"In 2019 year  4000 detected fires and this year almost 7000 fires but this time land burned is 30 times bigger.\"\n\nAlso you pointed that more CO2 is good because vegetation is more dense and grow faster.\nThat is just another problem because now you need more mitigation measures because dry more dense vegetation fire is harder to put out. So more CO2 is not good but bad to fire spreading ability.\n\n2)\"If thermal radiation emitted by the Sun can easily penetrate that layer of CO2 in the atmosphere why can’t it do likewise when emitted from the surface of the Earth.\"\n\nThis is not how is working! \nSun emits LIGHT, this is not invisible thermal radiation, and when light hits the ground it transform it self to heat.\nYou understand?\nIt can go IN but it can't go OUT 😂 \nActually it can go in very easily but not so easy when it go out.\n\nSo light  go  trough atmosphere without problems and when it heats ground, ground radiate back to space and that radiation is stooped or suppressed (not reflected to earth) to radiate to space by GHGases.\n\nWhen IR radiation( Infrared Radiation or thermal as you called)  from ground to space is suppressed, ground can't cool down so fast and stay warmer and if you add more GHGases (water vapor, CO2, CH4, NO2 etc) ground radiation to space is even more suppressed and it can't cool down even more and it stay even warmer.\n\nExample:\nImagine that you have oven and constant heating electric source in that oven and say you have 2 inch of thermal insulation of that oven. \nTemp. of that oven will reach temp. that is equal of energy IN and energy OUT.\nSo oven heats up for example to 500F.  But if you add 1  inch more of thermal insulation now heating losses to surrounding trough that insulation is now lower and for oven to compensate this it heat up at new higher temp., for example 600F so now again energy IN is equal to energy OUT but temp. inside oven is higher this time.\n\nAlso understand this. Only reason why oven heated up is because when you putted more insulation, energy IN was HIGHER than energy OUT  and new equilibrium is reached when oven was heated to 600F so again energy IN is same as energy OUT.\n\nNow when you know that, find term \"radiative forcing\" in google (it's very important in climate science)  because that term explain what is difference between two cases I just explained to you with oven example, but for our atmosphere.\n\nFor example on Moon average temp. is -23°C (-9F) and on Earth, because we have GHGases it's much warmer 15°C (59F). Why? Because moon do not have atmosphere at all so all radiation from moon surface is radiated to space without any suppression. It cool it self very fast.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Kloko Loko", "channel": "UCTjA6jHHcAVRQY2dJSHscaQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRMtnoxfu_eKMhZE6R3QUbeZRFtVfY4ImiLqe3M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'll start off by noting that I am not fervently opposed to the creation of nuclear power plants, but I believe the solution is imperfect and temporary at best. Your first statement is extremely debatable, it's true that nuclear power plants do not emit greenhouse gasses, but radioactive fission waste is extremely dangerous. We have no long term storage solution for this nuclear waste. The more that the nuclear power industry expands, and the more facilities need to be built to contain waste, the more that price goes up. Nuclear power is also the single most catastrophe bound form of energy there is. I have no doubt that America would never let a nuclear power plant meltdown, but increased standards for building quality and security measures mean that these are upfront costs are not going to go away. The final nail in nuclear power for being a permanent solution is its nonrenewablity. The fact is that any power source that can potentially be completely consumed in under 100 years means that it is impossible for it to be sustainable. \nGreen energy has a myriad of issues. It takes up lots of space, requires tons of upfront capital, and can have adverse effects on the local environments. It seems very feasible that many of these issues can be solved due to its technological immaturity. Even if they can't, I feel that they pale in terms of the long term issues presented by nuclear power.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Joel Milkie", "channel": "UCJSEtFQKfwfzZWOLbt661lA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/EY5h7aINB1Ap2VCMy3ZIfVn-RZikxrAdALbnueUeLXuYBWOljRWfH2cVaHh4YEjCAFe2fBdKKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(remember this, because it will happen).\n\nWhen you heat the planet you have changing of the climate at whole planet, some changes are less strong in some areas and some areas have more severe climate change.\nHotter planet air can hold more water vapor so floods are more severe.\nAlso because temp. is higher dry areas can become drier in dry season so wild fires are more severe.\nMore energy in ocean water (hotter water) = stronger hurricanes.\n\nIn general,  hotter planet = more weather active planet. \n\nMan made climate change didn't happen overnight, we are heating more than 100 years, until we started burning coal, oil and gas.\nCO2 today in air is 50% higher than in year 1850 and CO2 gas in air do not let planet to cool down so fast.\n\nFor further information search : how greenhouse effect works.\n\nLearn from reliable and reputable sources, YouTube is not so good.\n\nGo to climate NASA.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Rony Stampanado", "channel": "UChvgJh2ynnqVRD4Rkf_cXVg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQTPO4iSzXfBMqYC6OT2O2TJ0GNmuhyapVD8gEZ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Some of the models suggest to Dr [Wieslav] Maslowski that there is a 75 per cent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during the summer months, could be completely ice-free within five to seven years.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the climatologist whose work Mr Gore was relying upon dropped the former Vice-President in the water with an icy blast.\r\n\r\n\"It's unclear to me how this figure was arrived at,\" Dr Maslowski said. \"I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this.\"\nIt's now 2021 and the northern ice sheet is larger than it was then.  This is from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) 2009 \"Arctic sea ice extent averaged over November 2009 was 10.26 million square kilometers (3.96 million square miles).\"  And again in 2021  \"Arctic sea ice extent averaged for March 2021 was 14.64 million square kilometers (5.65 million square miles).\"   That's about a 40% INCREASE.  Jester, I know you wont relent on what you \"know\" to be, but you should.\nLook up \"global temp data for past 500,000 years\" and look at the graphs.  You'll see that about every 130k to 160k years there is a spike in temps, some as high as 8 deg higher than we are now, all with no humans or SUV's, which means that we are currently due for an increase whether or not humans even exist.  \nLastly, until someone can tell us what the IDEAL AND NECESSARY temperature is that we must all shoot for then what is all this really about?

Just because a species dies (exactly why I stated the fact that more species have died than currently live on the planet)  doesn't mean the planet is sick.\n\nFrom   https://climate-nasa-gov.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/climate.nasa.gov/evidence.amp?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D#aoh=15729691080917&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fclimate.nasa.gov%2Fevidence\n\n  The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization.\n\nEverytime the climate changes some animals die and some animals thrive. That's how life on this planet works.  The planet isn't getting sick when the climate changes,  like now.  \n\nBasically,  this all boils down to a single truth.  The climate will almost assuredly change with or without humans. When different things are entered into an ecosystem,  that ecosystem adapts.  You can try to cite small examples all you want but the ecosystem of the entire planet has always adapted. Furthermore,  damn near every single scientific forecast about the climate has up until now been wrong.  \n\nThese are from Earth Day in 1970:\n1. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”\n2. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.\n3. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”\n4. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”\n5. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”\n6. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”\n7. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.\n8. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”\n9. In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”\n10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”\n11. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.\n12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.\n13. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).\n14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.'”\n15. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.\n16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”\n17. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”\n18. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”\n\n Let’s keep those spectacularly wrong predictions from the first Earth Day 1970 in mind when we’re bombarded in the next few days with media hype, and claims like this from the Earth Day website:\n\nGlobal sea levels are rising at an alarmingly fast rate — 6.7 inches in the last century alone and going higher. Surface temperatures are setting new heat records about each year. The ice sheets continue to decline, glaciers are in retreat globally, and our oceans are more acidic than ever. We could go on…which is a whole other problem.\nThe majority of scientists are in agreement that human contributions to the greenhouse effect are the root cause. Essentially, gases in the atmosphere – such as methane and CO2 – trap heat and block it from escaping our planet.\nSo what happens next? More droughts and heat waves, which can have devastating effects on the poorest countries and communities. Hurricanes will intensify and occur more frequently. Sea levels could rise up to four feet by 2100 – and that’s a conservative estimate among experts.\n\nHere's a good one: \n\nhttps://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ivan calkins", "channel": "UCI1jdAbcUsVxlDboeRUykyQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR6g2Br8R6kUzKCUGYuoYEh0A43hjlRTyqYXj2ciw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes, the global climate has definitely warmed since the Little Ice Age (about 1400-1700 AD), and it will likely continue to warm for another 200-300 years, in fits and starts, towards a max temp roughly matching that of the Medieval Warm Period. That time followed a colder period before the founding of Rome between about 750 BC to 200 BC … Although temperatures have been generally mild over the past 500 years, we should remember that significant fluctuations are normal.\"\n\nUniversity of Houston professor Larry Bell, the founder and director of  the Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture, wrote in Forbes...", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "ivan calkins", "channel": "UCI1jdAbcUsVxlDboeRUykyQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR6g2Br8R6kUzKCUGYuoYEh0A43hjlRTyqYXj2ciw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This apparent inconsistency is known as the ‘Faint Young Sun’ paradox and to reconcile the observation of a relatively stable climate in the face of increasing solar output through time requires a parallel change in some other factors that influence Earth’s radiative budget. \n\n\nOur new compilation and probabilistic treatment reveals that for the last ∼420 Myrs, CO2, on the whole, has been elevated compared to pre-industrial values (278 p.p.m.). The highest CO2 values of ∼2,000 p.p.m. were reached during the Devonian (∼400 Myrs ago) and Triassic (220–200 Myrs ago), with individual estimates ranging up to a maximum of ∼3,700±1,600 p.p.m. at 215 Myrs. In contrast, values close to pre-industrial are found during much of the Carboniferous (∼300 Myrs ago) and late Cretaceous (∼80 Myrs ago). A linear fit to either the entire CO2 compilation, or a resampling of our LOESS fit to reflect the original data density, reveals that long-term average CO2 has declined over the last 420 Myrs by ∼3.4 p.p.m. per Myrs (Fig. 1).\n\nCouple of things here.  One,  all of this is debated by scientists themselves,  meaning no one really knows or can prove anything when it comes to climate change.  Two,  if you are to believe the information currently out there,  the CO2 in this planet has been magnitudes higher than it currently is today.  If that is indeed the case,  that should prove to you that artificially raising the CO2 levels will not cause permanent damage, or at least history shows that it hasn't.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ivan calkins", "channel": "UCI1jdAbcUsVxlDboeRUykyQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR6g2Br8R6kUzKCUGYuoYEh0A43hjlRTyqYXj2ciw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

By far and away the majority of them all say that it’s going up.

The catastrophe is the effect the temp changes have on economies, almost all bad and costly... and rising sea levels in places that have large and small communities and countries affected by this.  Not even really talking about the current effect it is having on small island nations like Micronesia, but cities like Miami that are already having to spend millions of dollars on the problems that rising sea levels present.  \nThere is also the potential for global conflict over resources newly exposed by the melting of glaciers.

{"cid": "UgwhQC8V4069wFLTKAF4AaABAg", "text": "Over 30,000 scientists say 'Catastrophic Man-Made Global Warming' is a complete hoax and science lie.\n\nWednesday, August 31, 2016 by: Daniel Barker\n\nThe highly-politicized climate change debate rages on as we approach the crucial 2016 U.S. presidential election, despite an ever-growing body of evidence revealing the fact that \"catastrophic man-made global warming\" is nothing more than an elaborate hoax.\nAnd the November election may prove to be a victory for the hoaxers, according to experts who happen to be among those who dare to challenge the spurious climate change narrative.\nOne of these experts is Weather Channel founder John Coleman, who is now warning that the election could prove to be a \"tipping point\" in favor of people like Al Gore, who continue to amass vast fortunes based on the global warming scam.\nIn a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said:\n\"Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the 'global warming' debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn\n  for four to eight years.\"\nClimate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades.\nAl Gore's dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 - a year that was touted as being \"the hottest ever\" in the Earth's history - there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.\nDebunking the \"97 percent\" lie\nOn top of those \"inconvenient truths,\" the White House's assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the \"97 percent\" statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading.\nMore objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe.\nFrom the National Review:\n\"A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.\"\nOther mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda - even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.\nAnd, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.\n       Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth - not human activity.\nAl Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax\n But the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you're still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 - largely due to investments in fake \"green tech\" companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.\nYou might want to take all of this information into serious consideration before casting your vote in the November election.\n        \nLiberals are fucking morons.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Steven Prime", "channel": "UC4B-Y9dsOD0WddVuNLSud2w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRc5T85pllCanpjegsq7fxsfnfpdVHjz1gBTn2g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Climate change policies are nothing more than fear mongering to tax the shit out of the people and line their pockets (government officials and elites) theres a reason that all the data they use starts in the 1970s and theres where the hockey stick idea comes from. Fake data incomplete data and bad math that's what they like to use to scare you. If you want to stop climate change we would have to shut out the sun and fix the earths wobble and nod then we would no longer have seasons.

CO2 inst just \"possibly\" a greenhouse has, it is objectively one. The carbon we release doesnt disappear anywhere. Sure climate is always changing, the problem is the rate at which it is changing and how it affects the ecosystem. Our own survival depends on it being stable and us being able to adjust to the rate its changing. Right now we cant do that. The sea is rising by a few mm every year and the rate is accelerating, thats an objective fact, its measurable. Denying it because the complexity of climate make accurate prediction problematic doesnt help anyone. It wont be good for us regardless which model ends up being more accurate.\nIs human activity the cause of global warming? No. There is indeed nothing that would suggest that we are. But its incredibly ignorant and hypocritical to dismiss human activity as a contributing factor. No one would give a shit if we could keep up with the change. The issue is - we cant!

Obviously it isn't possible. My point was to let u know that I'm a earth loving environmentalist. \n\nThere isn't really a solution due to the earth being occupied by many different countries of many different ppl. Even if 1 country does the right thing, it is countered by many other countries who don't care.\n\nJapan kills whales. We all know this. Whose going to stop them? Nobody. Do we go to war? Probably not.\n\nThe Democrats will weaponize climate change to get votes, justify their spending, and to enslave the American ppl. This cost trillions of dollars with no justifiable results.\n\nRepublicans believe in freedom and liberty. It's about the individual. If u believe in it, than u go do it. This is free.\n\nI can only suggest 2 things. Stop focusing on climate change, but rather, focus on pollution and trash. U can use plastic bottles, just make sure it doesn't go into the ocean.\n\n2nd part is, all of us need to do this, not just 1st world countries. So we have to help 3rd world countries become 1st world countries. Ppl don't care about the planet if they starving. They only care if their bellies are full.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is, 3rd world countries cannot come up without oil. The world needs oil. It's easy for a country like USA to go \"no oil\". They already have the infrastructure to make that a reality. But poor countries desperately need oil to come up. Once they come up, THAN they can focus on not using oil.\n\nSo for now, instead of trying to do some pseudo counter intuitive earth destroying acidic battery BS, we should keep using oil for now.\n\nIt is true that if compare a gas car vs EV, EV is obviously better. But if u factor in mining, production, waste, essentially the entire process, and put that on large scale, EV becomes harmful. So ur just replacing 1 problem with another. The biggest problem is that, this process cannot be accomplished without oil.\n\nSo when I hear extreme idealistic environmentalist coming up w simple solutions, and tells me that's a fact,, and that science is behind it, I'm just rolling my eyes.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "noctis129", "channel": "UC3WgtU4cH6WJmSDY4SMr0kg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTlIm_iLkzjCx4Ix6OekBaXygCjWFtJJrPHDw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The \"myriad\" of studies since the 1970's have ALWAYS overwhelmingly predicted AGW.  From -\nhttps://skeptoid.com/episodes/4487\n\"One gauge of the spread of the uncertainty of the 1970s was a 2008 study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society titled The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus. It was a survey of climate articles published between 1965 and 1979 in the scientific literature, rather than of those published in the mass media. The authors found that 10% of the articles did indeed predict cooling, 28% found the data insufficient to make a prediction either way, and 62% predicted global warming. In other words, 90% of climate articles in scientific journals in the 1970s did not conclude the Earth was cooling. Pretty much the opposite of how it was portrayed in the popular mass media, which shouldn't surprise anyone whose profession is science communication.\"\n\nAnd that was just the start of research into the subject.  Since then, our information, understanding and overall knowledge has expanded greatly.  And I hope you can guess what those studies have confirmed -\nhttps://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/climate-change-consensus-07042018/\n\nAlso, FYI oil companies, such as Exxon, have produced their own research that also overwhelmingly supports AGW, but have kept such information hidden.  From -\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/opinion/exxon-climate-change-.html\n\"In short, Exxon Mobil contributed quietly to climate science and loudly to raising doubts about it. We found that, accounting for reasonable doubt given the state of the science at the time of each document, roughly 80 percent of the company’s academic and internal papers acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. But 81 percent of their climate change advertorials in one way or another expressed doubt.\r\"\n\nSo, as Mr. Knowles is a man who purportedly advocates science, it is unfortunate that he has adopted a somewhat willful ignorance of the subject.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Monkeyboysdontknow", "channel": "UCroaU6gxYzPAfrzJ1jUk8Vw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGZrFlttNkkgHOlimGhVN6G9G3y9NNnz23NA6N=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz0rJIM1-jt0TkGN954AaABAg", "text": "One thing is certain. Temperature LEADS increases of CO2, proven over hundreds of thousands of years of ocean sediment and ice cores. After temperature increases then there will be an increase in CO2 . Sometimes it takes decades or even centuries for it to manifest. Conversely, after temperature decreases, there will then be a decrease in CO2.  In other words, adding CO2 into our atmosphere has NEVER in hundreds of thousands or even millions of years caused a temperature increase. As well as should plants eat so much CO2 that a lowering in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere results will NOT cause a temperature decrease. It's just one of those plain ole facts liberals hate so much. \"Global Warming\" or (now that there is no global warming ) \"climate change\" has always and forever since the formation of the earth been part of the overall atmospheric condition. The sun is the main driver of climate on earth. We have a NON-circular orbit, we have a axial precession, and we have an axial \"tilt\" that all change , at fairly predictable times, that cause the climate change, and there is exactly not one goddamn thing we can do about it but prepare for the change. By the way, we are overdue by a few hundreds years for a cooling time. Cooler climate is bad for humans and civilization. Warming periods are good for humans and civilizations. Mainly, it is an issue of food. Can't grow food in the cold. One of the first indicators of a cooling earth is the very upper atmosphere...the ionosphere and stratosphere....and its temperature. We have seen a cooling in the upper atmosphere. This WILL lead to a cooler earth.Kinda like gravity...drop a rock, it WILL fall. WHY? well we really do not understand why there is this attraction between masses, but we know there is, and it is predictable. Same with upper atmosphere temperature changes. All this isn't controversial...just plain ole ordinary mainstream science...but the Left has seen this climate thing as an opportunity to take your money and take power. It is a con job. They INTEND to fuck you over with this...scare children, tell lies...all to control the economy ,take your money, and get power......the bastards. The vile despicable nasty terrible bastards. Just another point of fact.; we are in a CO2 deficit, with respect to the needs of plants. Plants means food. Never ever forget that. No plants, no food. No way.

The big problem is when we mess up so many of nature’s intricate systems and things are so fucked up, how do we get them back on track? Coral reefs are bleaching/dying, species are becoming extinct, farm soil is depleting and so much more. I’m concerned about it and if you aren’t, I kind of believe more that the 1% have dumbed us down to be even more stupid. That’s scary too!

They're for conserving the rights of individuals to do as much as they possibly can without limitations.  They want the freedom to have their way.  This is demonstrated by the constant push from conservatives to reduce as much as possible the powers of the government, and to place the power in individuals hands.  That sounds very righteous on paper, and in many ways it actually is, but when it comes to conservation of the nature, it is devastating.\n\nSecondly, it's always hilarious to see people praise a man who can easily discredit a young student who is not well-studied on the topic she's addressing.  Have a discussion with someone who actually studies climate science, who actually knows the facts.  He claims temperature has only increased 0.2 degrees in the past 100 years....Someone who actually knew what they were talking about would call him out for his misinformation.  Temperature has increased 0.2 degrees C EVERY DECADE for the last 40 years.\n\n\nWhat catastrophe should we plan to avoid?  We are already seeing catastrophe.  Coral reef coverage in the Caribbean has declined by 80% in the last decades.  As oceans warm at too high a pace for the corals to adapt to, they bleach and die.  As CO2 is absorbed into the ocean, acidifying it, corals struggle to produce the skeletons that allow them to grow.  As land ice melts and increases sea level, corals struggle more and more to get the light they need to photosynthesize.  \n\n\nWe are in the catastrophe right now.  It's not about avoiding it.

The main question was do you think man has affected the climate of the planet? While many answered in the affirmative, this does NOT draw one to the conclusion of the worlds end. The other main point they make is that when climate change starts to increase global warming by 2 degrees per decade the world will end in a century! This is a somewhat true statement actually. By our current tracking in the last 70 years the temperature has increased by an average of 0.2 degrees(over the 70 years not per decade).

Is there any danger of driving the environment of the Earth toward the planetary hell of Venus or the global ice age of Mars ?  The simple answer is that nobody knows.  The study of the global climate, the comparison of the Earth with other worlds, are subjects in their earliest stages of development.  They are fields that are poorly and grudgingly funded.  In our ignorance, we continue to push and pull, to pollute the atmosphere and brighten the land, oblivious of the fact that the long term consequences are largely unknown .\n\nA few million years ago, when human beings first evolved on Earth, it was already middle-aged, 4.6 billion years along from the catastrophes and impetuosities of its youth.  But we humans now represent a new and perhaps decisive factor.  Our intelligence and our technology have given us the power to affect the climate.  How will we use this power ?  Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency in matters that affect the entire human family ?  Do we value short-term advantages above the welfare of the Earth ?  \nOr will we think on longer time scales, with concern for our children and our grandchildren, to understand and protect the complex life-support systems of our planet ?

The average global temperature has risen much more than .2 degrees in the past 100 years. The \"hockey stick\" graph has not been shown to be a fraud, merely a victim of distorted interpretation. Whatever the motivation for both sides, the use of science (which is a method, not a religion) is the only way to determine the true facts. Micheal Knowles is an excellent debater, as is Ben Shapiro. Being an excellent debater does not require objective facts, only convincing rhetoric. One technique is to pile on assertion after assertion and not allow the listener to absorb the essence, and test the veracity of the assertions. Yes, the global climate has varied greatly over time. This change that is taking place currently is the first to be influenced by mankind. Other dramatic shifts in climate have been caused by natural events. Rapid shifts have been caused by massive asteroid strikes or clusters of volcanic activity or more slowly by orbital shifts, i.e., Milankovitch cycles. If one first understands the principles of the Greenhouse effect, which make our planet habitable, one can appreciate that if the percentage concentration CO2 (which is only a trace gas) doubles, why would it not have a strong influence on the global temperature and influence the climate?\nIn our system of setting public policy, of course politics will play a major role and many people on both sides have a lot to personally gain or lose.

In light of last year's UN report, isn't it time for us to be a little more proactive? That's why I have a problem with the stance of many high profile conservatives on this issue. \"Until you show me hard, indisputable, irrefutable proof, I'm not lifting a finger.\" It's really not helping us.\n\nI have very conservative views on most issues, whether it's identity politics, abortion, gun laws, immigration, to name but those.

What a fucking idiot. One guy being wrong does not invalidate the entire scientific community you moron. \n\n\"Show me the catastrophe\" Ok then, where to begin? \n1. The world's ocean ARE rising already and coastal regions are not at risk, they are guaranteed to be flooded. Areas of Mexico and Miami are already suffering flooding from high tides, This is caused by severe ice loss in the Arctic and Greenland. \n2. Wildfires are already breaking out around the world, California is most famous right now, As is Siberia. Even in the UK and Australia. This trend will continue and become worse. \n3. Category 5 hurricanes are making themselves known and are more frequent now even happening out of season, Soon we see some the first ever Cat 6 hurricanes. \n4. Sustained prolonged heat waves across EU, Asia and the Middle East are already happening, India and Pakistan are hitting 55.c / 131.f for weeks at a time last year and already this year. \n5. The jetstream that divides warm south air from frigid north air around the Arctic Circle is no longer uniform, it's becoming wavey and it is stalling which is drawing up hot air over the Arctic making the ice melt faster with air temps reaching 9.c when it should be more like -5.c to -2.c, and pushing the \"polar vortex\" over the USA, didn't you wonder why it's called the polar vortex? It's supposed to be over the pole not the US. \n6. We are having unseasonable erratic weather patterns and cold snaps in spring, esp prevalent in the EU which decimating crops. Again caused by the Jet stream stalling. \n7. Unprecedented flooding in many parts of the world, most famously right now the mid-US with dams and levees bursting at the sheer amount of water. \n8. perversely other parts of the world are suffering decades long droughts leading to famine, disease, civil unrest and wars.\n9. The heating has turned the Siberian Permafrost into PermaThaw. It is melting and thawing out at a breakneck pace so fast that scientists trying to monitor the speed of melt are losing their equipment as it sinks into what was solid frozen soil now become deep slush in a matter of weeks. This thaw is releasing gigatons of Methane which is 20+ times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat. Also Arctic ocean methane clathrates are melting due to sea temp increases which is releasing even more CH4. This is also being repeated at 7000 other lakes, seas and rivers around the world!\n10. Oceanic Anoxic dead zones are forming around the worlds oceans, this is massive pockets of ocean devoid of oxygen due to bacterial interactions with increased Ocean CO2 levels. These zones are getting bigger every single day and account for several fish die offs in recent years. \n11. Oceanic acid levels are also increasing due to CO2 forming carbonic acid in water. This is deadly to phytoplankton and coral and also fish. \n\nMan I could go on like this for some time. Just understand this; climate change IS REAL, it IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. And yes! YOU ARE TO BLAME!\nI agree Taxation is NOT going to solve anything at all. It IS bullshit. What we need to do to save ourselves, because it is an existential threat to all life.

Man does not control the weather on this planet the Sun does!  We learned this in Grade School before Science became Political!  So much for the Lefts Global Warming Religion!  I think it says that in the end times that \"those who think themselves to be wise, will be made to look foolish\"!  The Grand Solar Minimum and the New Mini-Ice Age will make a lot of Liberals who think they are wise to look FOOLISH!  Watch this video from one of the premier Solar Physicist in the World today!  Valentina Zharkova and the Grand Solar Minimum on youtube!  Also the Libtards and their fake Climatologist Flunky's are always pushing their Bovine Fecal Matter Narrative about CO2 increases!  In 1962 the CO2 levels were measured at 320 Parts Per Million, and then in 2018 the CO2 levels were measured at 400 Parts Per Million. An 80 ppm Increase in just less than  60 years!  Let's put this into perspective; CO2 only accounts for less than .04% of the total atmospheric mass of planet Earth and is an inert Gas!  If you know anything about agriculture a 80 PPM increase in CO2 is meaningless and in no way causes the environment to retain Heat!  During the last Ice Age, CO2 levels were 800% higher than they are today (Ice Cores)! The CO2 argument just does not hold up to REAL SCIENCE!  Climatologists are not Real Scientists they are a group a peer reviewed writers of so called Scientific Papers which only promote their views of Global Warming and supports the Left's narrative!

Then it will get hot again for a very long time. We are currently in the period were it is slowly getting hotter, even if humans never existed the temperature would still rise, that's a fact. So what's the worst us humans can do? Maybe speed up that cycle by 10 year? 20? 1,000 years?

For example, CO2 makes ocean water more acidic.\n\nI am not an alarmist in that I acknowledge predictive models produce varied conclusions and that the degree of change is less severe than environmentalists report.\n\nHe was specifically asked about environmental policy and couldn't come up with a simple recommendation. Regardless of his opinion on climate change there are plenty of moderate solutions available to improve water and air quality, combat erosion, and to become more sustainable.\n\nAs an example:\nWe define minimum water quality metrics the community agrees to maintain such as turbidity and dissolved solids. If water quality doesn't meet the minimum standard there's a penalty imposed on the city's waste water treatment facility. Consequently, the waste water treatment facility will increase the cost of water services. The money collected from the penalty must be redistributed to areas in the community that are most responsible for the water pollution. So, if dissolved solids is too high because farmers aren't using cover crops in the winter to prevent erosion the money can pay for a farmer's cover crops.\n\nMy opinion:\nHe stayed in the lane of his party's predefined political narrative.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Paul Drees", "channel": "UCn1rFeKlmH31SKaLmVoDu_w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuWFFEuTzdPLwEoOyBPAYLBYXZZn1JLnvlCQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugzh8cpxtNlbMri5BN94AaABAg", "text": "Burning of fossil fuels \"causes\" global warming and global warming \"causes\" the release of greenhouse gasses. Both are true. A 0.2 increase over 100 years is outrageously fast in geologic time scales, and geologic time scales are all we have to go on when interpreting the effects of climate change. So given the data we have to work with, climate change is a problem.\n\n\nI think I would have answered this girl in two ways: \nFirst, my \"solution\" to climate change is nuclear power. I firmly believe that nuclear power is as close to a panacea we'll ever find, doubly so if we ever get nuclear fusion working. Considering that all the nuclear waste from all of earth's power plants ever will fit inside a basketball court (or something like that, it's not much) I think disposal isn't really a big deal. \nSecondly, the life on earth has rebounded from mass extinctions that occurred over shorter periods of time than anything warned about by the left today. Near as we can tell, none of those previous extinction events fell upon sapient life. We have technology, we are inventive and we are already outgrowing the limitations of our natural world. If the planet becomes uninhabitable in the next few hundred years, yeah, we're probably going to go extinct. But I genuinely don't think it'll take much more time than that to where our technology will make our species capable of surviving catastrophies. Thus, the challenge for the environmentalist movement is to convince me that climate change presents an existential threat to life on our planet within the next few hundred years.

Astrophysics and math show it to be true and a very real result of burning up all the fuel a star burns up in it's life.  As the sun ages, it begins to expand and become hotter as it tries to keep the nuclear furnace going. \n\nHere is how the earth's climate gets generated.\n\nEnergy from the sun crosses the void between earth and sun.  That energy heats the surface of the earth which radiates the heat up into the atmosphere.  The heat gets trapped by the greenhouse gases that are present in the atmosphere as it begins it's process of rising through the atmosphere to eventually radiate off into space.\n\nGreenhouse gases absorb and retain heat.  This was proved over a century and a half ago by John Tyndall.  It's just a fact of physics that if you increase the density of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere, like we are doing today using copious amounts of fossil fuels as a source of energy, you are going to increase the amount of absorption and retention of heat within the earth's atmosphere thus warming the climate.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Les Schorlemer", "channel": "UCfgnvY8bNlFUN2sXvhNehyg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgSz-br7sqlhhUWY9Tf2IS25LgInkou8a86g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Conservatives, at least the ones I know who have standard knowledge about the environment and can reasonably speak to it honestly and civily, are largely for ensuring the environment is taken care of. What we aren't for is the political, cultish and corrupt nonsense that goes along with activist environmentalists. Knowles said it best that we don't believe man serves nature; that is a religion/cult of these folks and cannot be taken seriously in any conversation. You can't pretend that imposing your will on anyone and our government with force, in regards to the environment specifically, is a reasonable proposal that anyone would listen to. It's even worse because then they say we can't ask questions, we can't express concerns, we can't make conclusions or appeals because of this flimsy appeal to certifications and credentials that is wholly arbitrary and in fact unscientific. I believe politics and working on environmental solutions are not in any way compatible. They shouldn't even be in the same room. I was just having an argument with an environmentalist cult member(aka a YouTube comment section environmentalist) who believed straws in the ocean and in turtles noses, both of which are anecdotal and nuanced, somehow warrants big government statist policies. This is among other fraudulent theories and underlying premises that they don't want you challenge at all, even when facts, examinations, basic scrutiny, or statistics debunks them. \nHopefully we can get past the canards, obfuscations, hysteria, existential threats, and incoherence, and actually be productive on all fronts.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Darth Balsamic", "channel": "UC36yIAabhQdTTzUUfAy2few", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRcXP5-FBXr0VMXc-SNr0-tdr-SkpvIH6VhjyG5XxPvk8XAG7cpgwXshtxd1h3Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The reality is that natural disasters have always happened and there is no evidence that the intensity or frequency is getting more severe. Furthermore people who live in areas that have such disasters have adapted their lifestyles in order to survive them, and with modern forecasting evacuations of areas that will receive brunt damage has improved. As to the droughts... that is pure grade-A bullshit. A hotter climate will produce more rain by the simple fact that there will be more water evaporation.

Even in simulations, there is a reason and purpose for each and every person here. I'd also like to challenge the idea of \"no absolute truths\" when gravity, thermodynamics, nuclear science, astrophysics, and other sciences that demand order and solid truths to exist. Even something simple as mathematics needs solid absolute truth to work more often than not. While this is maybe a simulation,(not saying it is, I'm just supposing it is. Think of Plato and his logic system in his laws book) to say that absolute truth is non-existent is foolish. We can't find a triangle, and there fore construct most buildings, without Sine, Cosine and tangent. We can't determine the tensile strength of concrete without a static item, like iron, to compare with.

Not thrusting science on everything is definitely correct so even from my part, dont thrust everything peoole tell you - question everything and to seak the truth make some research ( doesnt need to be much maybe just read on the tooic to know what's it about). But having science for some religion taking everything for believes and holding on to not knowing everything and therefore making laws and facts just posibilities is not right. Judt think where would that lead us. It counteracts progress and inovations... You have certaintly seen in your lifetime the amazing progress of our kind. Your everyday life including talking to me via YT would not be possible if not for those \"beliefs\" and theories. Yes we make misstakes but arent afraid to admit that. Yes theories change because we as humankind always strive to learn and expand our knowledge. Sometimes misstakes have to be made and even false theories helped us evolve because sometimes that's all it takes. Some imagination in courage to say something, and that leads to other real things even if it was false in its core. Science as you said is open to dissproving things cause that's how we make progress. But many of those theories that can and are dissproven started of as aproximations where we didnt have all the information yet. But still i would like you to see that there are things that will not be disproven like 1+1=2 or 2>1, which also means some theories (meaning laws, as scientific tearm)  are also spot on correct.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "the last invoker", "channel": "UCvpl20xxkWb5JqXQOxmmkgw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSLd4A4Q_UL5kanK9_FYD1S99KBEXx05XIaDA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Photosynthesis no longer becomes possible when CO2 levels go below 150 ppm, and Photosynthesis peaks in efficiency at 1000 ppm. More efficiency means the plants can produce more glucose using less water, and more glucose means more energy for the remainder of the biosphere. Now, do I believe we should keep emitting CO2? No, that'd be idiotic, the fossil fuel industry is incredibly destructive, and CO2 is rapidly acidifying our oceans. However, as you stated, it needs to be gradual, especially for developing nations who are dependent on hydrocarbons.\n\n\nAlso, CO2 yes CO2 is toxic to humans as if it would enter our blood stream in significant amounts it would prevent our cells from undergoing cellular respiration. The Good thing is that our blood \"knows\" what is and isn't CO2 and can prevent it from entering our other cells in any significant amount. Humans need 195000 ppm of oxygen to funtion and live. Current oxygen levels are at 209500, so CO2 levels would only start becoming deadly to humans if it got near or above 14,500 ppm in concentration, so a 1000 ppm concentration would be well within the range for humans to survive.\n\n\nAlso, I don't agree with you on radiation, the amount of radiation of every ppm of CO2 absorbs decreases as CO2 concentrations increase, this is called logarithmic warming; furthermore, the only radiation that would be trapped is short and long infrared, so very low energy radiation, that doesn't harm life on Earth (unless it was being emitted at extremely high levels).", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "John Peric", "channel": "UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT68GrZP4pMCQxFt1i9y17x4aicCUNaqhQ_UrofKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The cost/benefit analysis in healthcare isn't strengthened when the govt gets its hands in the middle of it, you get politicians deciding who gets what care and how much when it should be in the hands of families and doctors, not the govt. Dont even start with academia either, you ppl on the left have controlled that realm for over 60 yrs and have none to blame but yourselves by dumping boatloads of money into programs that have had zero results. All the while putting communities in the hole for your ridiculous overspending. Taxation is absolute theft and you dems just want to use the govt gun to take people's hard earned money and waste it on empty platitudes and zero feasible solutions. Exhibit A.

For example the Left says \"We should rejoin the Paris Climate Accord\" to stop Global warming. I assume you would agree with that.  ..but China, India, and a bunch of other nations who are the TOP POLLUTERS in the world (I believe they are #1 and #2), according to the agreement, don't have to make ANY changes until 2034.  On top of that it calls China a \"developing nation\" so the US would have to give money to them.   Now if the biggest polluters don't have to make ANY changes for another 14 years, and you say we have 10-12 or it's over?   Isn't that like me making you buy tickets for a concert on June 1st but you can't use them until June 4th but if you don't buy them I call you an evil non supporter of live music?  \n\n\nSo what I am asking is...if you are pushing for a plan which requires massive regulation and massive amounts of dollars being directed where you want while at the same time saying the world will end by the time the plan kicks in??   That can't make sense to you.  Right?\n\n\n...and keep in mind.  I recall in High School when Al Gore told us 2014 was the end.  Or my mom recalling the front of Time Magazine in the late 70s saying scientist say millions would be dead by the 2000s because of the global freeze that is coming.\n\n\n....and please keep in mind..when innovation creates energy that is cleaner, more affordable, more access, etc...that is AWESOME and I'm totally for it.  The problem is that people get SO LOCKED IN on just saying \"Climate Change\" that ANYTHING I want to get from you to gain power or money....all I have do is put the word \"Green\" in front of it.  So my friend certainly push for us being cleaner and more efficient with energy, but learn to critical too when thing don't like up like a climate plan that doesn't start until after the day you say all is lost.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "mrhoffame", "channel": "UCtMWiTlDmIkzAtSE2vp8GUA", "votes": "39", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBzF79VSMGpkYfU6CB8GqxFPeFI4SsqPK6YgbO=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You can't even get Rep and Dems to agree on 50% of things, but you will get the entire WORLD on board policies?   I have always said that I think MANY people would HAPPY to give one more dollar to the govt if what they saw was problems being solved, the debt going down, etc. ...but what we see is a company like Solyndra getting 500 million dollars to make solar panel and now the business is closed? ...and the same party saying..give us more money and control and we will stop climate change?  \n\n\nI think we often mistake caring about an issue for trusting govt to solve it.

But I guess you're a vegan who doesn't eat meat at all,  right?  But if you do, you're a freaking dumbass. \nWe have trucks because we need the ability to tow or haul stuff around.

Unless you get a headshot, its still going to feel a lot of pain not to mention you are taking away the rest of its life that it could have had. What if there were young ones depending on the animal you just shot? What if its partner, parent or siblings are wondering what happened to him/her the next day? If you were a conscientious person, you'd be considering these things too. \nI think you should rewatch some of those RAM commercials, its not an accident that the guy talking has such a deep voice... cause the appeal is meant to be very \"manly\" because they know thats why people buy them. Why do you think it is that the emphasis isn't on utility and carrying stuff around which is what you say is the real reason? The trucks in the commercials are always empty lol. Besides, less rural or even urban republicans who don't have stuff to haul around are still driving them so you're wrong on that.\nYes of course the plants are doing some polluting but thats inevitable and doesn't even compare to whats being prevented when millions of people are driving hybrids or Teslas instead of the other cars.

An opinion in that matter would be moreover about what tool was used, than the killing itself . \nThen you say I'm arbitrarily deciding something... and in the same breath state any sane person would agree with me. Lol, arbitrary...  im stating myself from experiences and knowledge,  yet you aren't stating why killing animals is bad,  that's why I'm straw manning you.  I've presented logic and facts about that way of life,  and you keep saying I'm wrong,  yet you know nothing of that life. Ask anyone that is a hunter and country folk,  they will agree with me. \n\nConfidence is not about not taking anyone's shit. It's about having self assurance in ones own qualities or skills, a firm trust or a feeling about knowing a truth. That's confidence .\nIf you think someone laughing in your face is a threat,  then you've never been in a real fight or gone to battle. \"Not taking shit from anyone\" is just a juvenile response that shows a juvenile level of maturity.  \nEver seen roadhouse The movie? You're definitely not a Dalton character (The real man in the movie)\nI can't believe you lumped in \"army guys\" with navy seals.  And you said \"if they were dumb enough to take the effort to go through the abuse\". So much ignorance.  To be in NSW or a spec ops unit you've got to be smart,  let's just say much smarter than the average Joe.  It's 90% mental.  Then the rest is the ability to handle inconceivable amounts of stress/ plus insane level of physicality.  These guys are the cutting edge of warriors.\n\nYou know I'm right,  But your pride won't allow you to say the words \"you're right\".", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Ryknfjor", "channel": "UCXuwSSHJd-rnvymhsMtk0hQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSJiC8vcNfDna6cCEP9f68kRP52ixnM4sas5I05=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And what would you say to its loved ones who are going to miss him/her?” I work with animals on the weekends and I can tell you without a doubt that they have bonds with each other the same exact way we do with our loved ones. I’ve seen horses for example that start to appear depressed if one of their friends or family members is no longer around. I’m just curious if you understand this aspect of it or if it even matters to you. Also, you used the phrase “need to be killed” when certainly that is not the case. You can easily live on a meatless diet and be very healthy, yet you CHOOSE to eat animals because you derive pleasure from the taste at the expense of their life. And again I ask you, what gives you that right?

That puts insurmountable pressure on the leadership and is the fatal flaw in your ideology: The belief that government holds all the answers and therefore should have all the power. Making it all-powerful and removing all power from regular people means the assholes who might run a corporation now all compete to become the all-powerful dictator: and the most ruthless evil bastard wins and is surrounded by other power hungry bastards who want to take his place.

On a more serious note, \"fighting climate change\" is really about wealth redistribution. You think I'm going to say from the rich countries to poor? Nah! From us simple folk to the super rich. All you have to do is detach yourself emotionally from the conversation , just stand aside of the debate and observe. See who is getting rich(er) and who is getting poor(er) in this thing. I live in Canada. Our PM is woke about Climate Change ( and several other things ). His solution to climate change is to tax. Guess e\nwho pays the tax and who is exempt through   loopholes in laws, grants and allowances? Observe in your respective countries, which also introduced carbon taxes.  Also, if they care about carbon emissions, why are they going away from nuclear power? Why was there such a huge push for the extremely costly, subsidized windmills, which are super inefficient and have to be backed up by traditional, in many cases, coal burning power stations, and have a 20 year life span, after which they have to be dismantled? (And where does all the dismantled materiel go? By the way, the huge, several story high cement slabs that anchor the windmills under the ground? They stay in the ground. Forever. ). If you think about it it's the perfect money making scheme. Having said that I am by nature a skeptic. My skepticism goes up especially when I see the mass media, politicians and schools pushing something in unison. Like the \"weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq.

Changing the subject to money just kicks the can down the road. Few right-wingers would bitch about taxation if the scientific consensus showed a pending massive asteroid strike that could be stopped with a taxpayer-funded space mission. The main difference with AGW is that PEOPLE are being blamed for it, which wouldn't apply to an asteroid. Also, CO2 is invisible (not viscerally evident) so dummies can wish it away if they aren't personally affected yet. People are genetically programmed to react to rapid events, not slow trends, and rising CO2 is a trend.

Some things that aren't taken into consideration when people think about climate change is the ambition for all of us to do better in technology, to do it faster, better and more cheaply than the last guy did. Now if you hamper growth it will inevitably lead to more greenhouse gasses being released into the enviroment. If you limit energy, which is what you do if you turn away from fossil fuels, then people will not have a safe method for heating homes. So you will have people going with out heat. People will not do that, they will cut down more trees and burn those for heat and cooking when the power goes out (this is just a simple example obviously). Also something to consider is that we not only do not have the infrastructure in place for green energy, but also green energy will not even begin to come close to energy needs. First off we can't store the excess energy, we don't have the tech available to do that, so most of your power will be made in the day and in night, well not so much. But lets say we fix the storage problem, then you have to deal with the bird population. You see when you have either wind turbines or solar power, you have this major problem with killing local and migratory bird populations in the area. The turbines slice and dice but the solar literally cooks them in mid flight. They call them shooting stars at those large scale solar facilities out west, because when a bird flies into the heat path created by those solar cells, it literally sets on fire and drops out of the sky. It seems that the best way to control greenhouse emissions is to bring the world out of poverty as when you raise the median income of a given area, one of the natural responses people have is to try to do more for the environment. Also, a big issue too is this idea we can change what is happening. Based on geological data, this is something that happens roughly every 13k years or so. We are at the end of a 13k year cycle. before the end of the last cycle, Egypt was prairie land and the majority of America was under about 2 miles of ice. So the better question is not how to stop it, because that won't happen, the better question is how do we survive it? At least, that's the question I'm always asking. Now all of this aside, I absolutely agree that changes need to be made to help protect the environment. I mean you don't burn down your house because they shut off your water. But we also need to understand that going backwards will cause more harm than good. \n\nAlso, something that always comes to mind with this subject is how the richest among us are the ones to call for change because of the environment when those are the assholes how benefited the most. The jack dorseys, Bill gates, Mark zuckerburgs and Jeff bozos of the world. They literally benefitted from this shit more than anyone and now they want to tell us how we need to do better. I mean fuck all those assholes. Every aspect of their empires are based on fossil fuels and human suffering.

I feel it might be interesting for you to know that I'm actually not liberal. Politically, I'm smack dab in the center, and I lean right on several issues. I took a course in the sociology of conservatism (taught by a conservative) where I wrote a research paper on the conservative stance on climate change. I was fascinated by the rich history of environmental protection among notable conservatives back in the day. Even today, some are proposing conservative policies to address the risks of climate change (https://www.clcouncil.org/mission/). I wanted to see if Knowles had any of his own ideas for policies he'd support, but he didn't ever get to answering that. Doesn't matter if I'm speaking to a conservative, liberal, socialist, or a full-on marxist, if there was a gap in the information I was being given, I would push back on it and ask a question...Isn't that the point of attending speaker events like these?

Firstly there is a ton of evidence which backs the climate change is caused by human actions. \nBy air pollution the atmosphere thickens which makes it harder for sun energy to be reflected out of our atmosphere which makes the climate warmer. Trees and plankton that use co2 and absorb these to create air get more and more cut of or killed to pollution in the oceans. So if we could plant a hell lot of trees and plants that counter measure these effects we have won partially. \n\nIt gets really tricky when the ice caps melt of because they reflect most of the sun. So what will happen ? There is so much ice that can melt and if you ask scientists how much has already melted you‘ll be shocked. The water level in general will rise quite strongly. \nUltimately water temperature will get so high that the number and intensity of hurricanes will increase quite strongly so there you have the arguments about consequences as well. \n\nAnd there are some things we can do. If it is enough is hard to say but isn’t it worth to be trying so the human kind has a future on earth until the point the whole Milky Way collapses ? \nI don’t claim to know all kind of consequences and parts of these systems but this partial understanding is already enough to realize we have a problem which is existential.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "L.

The left don’t know what they are talking about. They really don’t. But then again some right wingers believe in the rapture and all sorts so just because one person is an idiot doesn’t mean that we should dismiss the argument entirely. \n\nThe facts as I have seen them are this: \n\nThere is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any other point in recorded history about 800,000 years worth. \n\nPeople say about natural cycles due to slight variations in the earth orbit and that is correct but we are at the peak of one of those cycles (and there are about 7 recorded from the biggest ice core we have) and we have exceeded all previous amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere including that cause by volcanic eruptions.\n\nSo if you can accept the fact that there is more Greenhouse gas in the atmosphere before, you can accept that the ramifications of that will be the heating of the globe. \n\nThe problem is not that the temperature has changed but that it has changed rapidly. More rapidly than ever before. We have never seen this sort of change and it is alarming.

There are approximately 30 million head of cattle in the US compared to 50 million plains Buffalo 200 years ago. Are we saying that cow farts are different to buffalo farts? No. She is just nuts. She isn’t wrong that methane is a greenhouse gas but she is just a bit cuckoo anyway. \n\nChina isn’t actually going to be a problem as they are so rich now they are focussing heavily on renewables. India, yes but that will leave just the US and India as the world’s biggest polluters. So saying “but China does it” is very short sighted and not actually an argument for anything. Two wrongs don’t make a right. \n\nJust remember the salient point is the rate of change not the change itself. If the temperature had increased gradually over thousands of years like it has before then that’s fair, but it has been increasing relatively rapidly compared to the rest of the cycle and the only explanation is the industrial revolution that occurred 200 years ago. \n\nBtw as an aside the actual biggest threat to the human race in terms of climate change (as decided by a global action panel) is not cow farts or CO2 at all. It is CFCs from refrigerators. By comparison is is 16,400 times as warming over 500 years as CO2 is. Some research actually (and quite accurately) suggests that the main cause of global warming is CFCs (the other greenhouse gasses compound the problem after the fact).
