{"cid": "Ugxqam4co-FIsY2Qi394AaABAg.9RsYaLIQ1kg9S5S_w8_LxS", "text": "The problem is you are dead wrong. Most climate studies you can pull up show the same few trends:\n\n1) Solar luminosity continues to rise consistently through it's lifetime. This has been going on since the birth of the Sun. This of course fluctuates slightly but the overall trend is parabolic increasing over the giga geologic time scale. We also know that relative sunspot activity seems to not affect global temperature in any significant way and that the luminosity of the sun doesn't appear to be a main driver to climate change but plays a supporting role. This is observed fact.\n\n2) We know that the early earth glacial periods were due to low luminosity and the interchange of heavy methane atmosphere to eventually normal CO2 load that the Earth could handle/generate. Since we know that sunspots and solar irradiance is not main driver, it was determined that the major factor in heat retention must be the greenhouse gas effect. Again we know this because we are able to measure the temperature of the stratosphere vs the trophosphere. If solar irradiance was the main driver, we would expect the stratosphere to have relative temperature gradients to the trophosphere. This does not happen. This is observed fact.\n\n3) We combine all lines of evidence together: solar luminosity, greenhouse gases natural and man made, as well as sunspot solar cycles and we very clearly see the major driver nudging the scale of global temperature rise is the amount of CO2 we have dumped into the atmosphere. From the industrial revolution, onwards it is major spike and it's clearly coming from human activities.\n\nIn conclusion, it's clear that humans are causing global temperature averages to rise from an observation level and from a common sense level. You can't just keep dumping CO2 into the atmosphere and just expect nothing to react. Combined with the inevitable natural rise of solar luminosity, again occurs in the giga range of the geologic time scale, and other possible heating factors from sunspot activity (negligible cooling to global temperature) and volcanic activity (typically cooling effect if enough dust is kicked up into the atmosphere) we can clearly see that the rise in CO2 due to human industrial activity is the data that is tipping the scale.", "time": "5 days ago", "author": "Dustnite", "channel": "UCqR1hUbagWL0wzJlcX4uTiw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSaOqPI1oYRm7sKmkmcewTTEuqvDj16puMcDbma=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzvdiSu6dk0C9j_2QF4AaABAg", "text": "‚ÄúThe cause of nearly every mass extinction was by loss of temperature.‚Äù\n\nNot 100% true, but not 100% false. Likewise, not every mass extinction event was caused by an increase in temperature.\n\nOrdovician, 445 MYA: Two main causes; \n\n1. The southward movement of the supercontinent Gondwana caused the sea levels to rise and fall over several million years, wiping out habitats gradually. \n2. It is suggested that a late-Ordovician ice age as well as general change in water chemistry was enough to kill off massive swaths of marine invertebrates.\n\nLate-Devonian - 370 MYA: Two events, the Kellwasser Event and the Hagenberg Event. \n\nThe Kellwasser Event involved a high amount of surface eutrophication, in which the water is covered so thickly in algae that it is unable to absorb sunlight, and not allowing anoxic bottom water to flow to the surface.\n\nThe Hagenberg Event was the rapid increase of terrestrial plants that absorbed greenhouse gasses, substantially reducing the temperature of the earth and causing the sea level fall from increased glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nPermian Extinction, PT, ‚ÄúThe Great Dying‚Äù - 252 MYA: A gradual increase in global climate temperature followed by a MASSIVE amount of global seismic activity, partially aided by asteroidal impact, caused a flurry of volcanic eruptions and sea floor spreading, releasing toxic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This event suffocated and burned 95% of marine life and 70% of terrestrial life alive. \n\nTriassic-Jurassic Extinction - 201 MYA: The cause of this event is a mystery. Scientists have proposed climate change or asteroidal impact, but no hard evidence has been found as to what caused this event.\n\nCretaceous Extinction Event - 65 MYA: The most recent mass-extinction event and the best understood. This is the one that you were taught about likely before you could form complete sentences. A gradual increase in seismic activity and climate change, and an asteroid impact that greatly increased the speed of both. The asteroid hit the Gulf of Mexico, killing most life on earth all on its own in a matter of 10 hours. This caused a massive shift in the earth‚Äôs tectonic structure, causing a global series of earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The eruptions caused a rain of burning ash to carpet the earth, trapping all life in a burning furnace. This EVENTUALLY results in the overall cooling of the planet, which combined with a lack of sunlight did kill off a sizable amount of Earth‚Äôs population. But it was not the primary cause.\n\nHolocene Extinction - Present Day: Scientists consider humans the cause of the next extinction event, through global domination, mass killing for sustaining the growing population, and the destruction of habitats to make room for their own. All of this is causing a series of global climate phenomena that could very well wipe us from existence.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "SpicyTunah", "channel": "UCgEc3S168RJtkgoo9At0AAQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSHCAClGHxPInfQd5q6VQY9CE0uUz4KElqsf4Ji=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzxMlDhYPdrBcMeXax4AaABAg", "text": "As a stats major, the climate change denier is a moron. Not only is it standard to use sample sizes of 30, not 30 samples like he claims, but the number that is needed isn't that simple. It depends both on the field of study and on what distribution your data follows. Additionally, this standard can be lowered further if you know your distribution and so you use that distribution to model instead of a normal approximation. That being said, not only do we meet the requirements for normal approximation with climate change, but we also know the distribution of the parameters, so we can actually exceed the level of accuracy needed even further by using a better model. Basically, we have an overwhelming amount data, more than enough to meet this guy's admittedly arbitrary requirements. Additionally, the denier is either ignorant of basic statistics (what he's incorrectly referencing is the Central Limit Theorem, which is taught an entry level stats class, which at my university every student is required to take for generals), or he is deliberately lying. Given how he cites Newton's laws of physics later on, which is stupid for a variety of reasons, I'm pretty sure it's both.\n\nAlso Vaush, rising temperature does lead to rising CO2, since the solubility of CO2 as carbonate ions decreases the higher the temperature is, so carbonate in the ocean evaporates as CO2 into the atmosphere (as a side note, the concentration of carbonate has increased enough to start killing a variety of species and destabilize a ton of underwater ecosystems in spite of the climate being hotter. If the warming were natural, the carbonate concentration would decrease).

It's well known that temperature fluctuates stronger the more locally you apply it. Many temperature trends observable on one hemisphere practically disappear once you look at the whole globe (like the European Medieval Warmth Period and \"little Ice Age\"). These stronger short-term fluctuations also contribute to masking long-term  changes like global warming.\n3) Ignores impacts of known climate patterns like the El Nino/La Nina cycles, which create natural fluctuations that can sometimes mask longer term effects like those of CO2. \n4) Starts and ends at arbitrary dates and can thus hide greater trends, most importantly of course the tremendous warming since the 20th century.\n\nAnd most importantly: Over earth's history you indeed do not see a direct correlation between temperature and CO2. But neither do you see one between the intensity of the sun and temperatures, even though it should be absolutely obvious that higher sun intensity warms the planet.\nThe solution to both of these problems is that once you combne both sun intensity and CO2 concentration, you get a perfect correlation with temperature. CO2 is thus the overwhelming earthly driver of earth's climate.

It will only bolster your following. Very poor debate and sadly, you lost a great opportunity to show your true knowledge, I know you're right here.

And the response to that was, that actually 99.94 % of scientists agree that climate change is man-made\n\n\nedit: and the 0.3 %, coincidentally, are the percentage of scientists who made an explicit statement about the cause of global warming but still ended up being neutral about whether it was man-made or not, in the sense that they were uncertain. Out of all the papers, examined in the study, 32.6% say that climate change is man-made. But since 66.7% of all papers don't state any evaluation of the cause of global warming at all, out of only those that do state an opinion, ~97% say it's man-made. That's how you get the 97%.

When high frequency infared light hits the surface of the earth, it is absorbed by objects and re-radiated in a broad range of frequencies.

{"cid": "UgxKD80ECmnqfeMCbul4AaABAg", "text": "Just watched a great video on this recent, and just as a point of clarification, the debater is actually correct that in the past there has been a significant time lag between Temperature Changes and CO2 changes.  Temperature has always come first followed by a CO2 change approx. 800-1000 years later.  This is due to the way gas dissolves into liquids, higher temperature == less gas dissolved in oceans => more gas in the atmosphere.  Lower temperature == more gas dissolved in oceans => less gas in atmosphere.  https://youtu.be/uqwvf6R1_QY?t=763\n\nThis is all to say that increasing the amount of gas in the atmosphere would have a significant and tangible effect on the heating of the planet because releasing more CO2 means that the same amount of gas is able to dissolve into the oceans but more CO2 is available to heat the planet => more CO2 is released from the oceans due to lower solubility => more heating (so on and so forth).  If anything, his point about Temperature changes leading CO2 changes is a cause for even more panic.  That is to say that literally, we could be facing a catastrophic amount of CO2 release in the next 800-1000 years as less gas is able to be dissolved into the oceans and is slowly released, even if we completely stopped CO2 emissions today.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Tyler Wardle", "channel": "UCKxOFpGUN_Z2W5TMY4N2nTw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSciBLUetxYAB9Z2Bc8rEcCnR9-DNorMOlG6f2tGg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Scientists have been trying to predict the temperature rise since they have stopped believing that the earth was facing global freezing in the 1970s, they have had no success whatsoever because 50 years have passed since the 1970s then they should have been able to predict the temperature rise in the 21st century but they cannot. Obviously, they are not going to be COMPLETELY accurate down to the 0.00000 number, but at least be close with the actual results, (which they failed to do). I called you a flat earther as a general term for someone who does not believe in science, not specifically saying you do not believe the earth is round. And by the way, science is defined on the definition that you can predict what will happen in the future given certain factors that are going to change, (think of it as a simulation), and scientists since the 1970s have failed to do so, (for example, predict the temperature rise in the 21st century based on how much co2 is in the atmosphere). I have been studying climate change for a while now and the more I got into it, the farther I went from the greenhouse gas theory. SO tell me now: where is the science if you cannot even make a simulation that shows how much temperature increases after how much co2 in the atmosphere increases? where is the science in that? Please I am eager to know where is the science in that because from what I understand, that is the definition of science. Just to clarify, most scientists believe that global warming is causing co2 levels to rise, not the opposite way.

{"cid": "UgzPalzrIdtCV3JFA054AaABAg", "text": "Gotta say. I was kinda disappointed with Vaush in this. This other guy came with a ton of basic myths on this issue, and Vaush seemed unprepared to answer a few of them.\n\nIdk how much Vaush has debated this in the past, but his inability to argue against the claim that there is no correlation between CO2 and temp, and his inability to explain the 800-year lag was pretty frustrating.\n\nFirst, yes. That guy is \"technically\" correct. There is no literal correlation between temp and CO2. That's bc CO2 isn't the ONLY factor in temperature. Other factors include the suns output and aerosols. CO2 is one of the main dials, but its not until you factor in the other things as well you see the real correlation. Its the same reason people on that side of this issue will never argue the sun's output and temperature are not correlated (and like CO2, they're not on their own). Its bc there's other factors outside of just the sun. But a lack of perfect correlation between CO2 and temp doesn't disprove CO2's role in temp increase.\n\nIts like trying to figure out why you're broke. Was it the drugs? Fast food? Or parties? \"Well when you look at the correlation between your money and the amount of parties you throw, there is no correlation.\" Fair, but is it fair to say that means it's completely unrelated? No. Especially when we all know I'm throwing hella parties. Of course on its own the correlation won't mean anything, but combined with the other key factors that we can actively check, there is an obvious correlation.\n\nOn the 800-year lag. I've linked a video to potholer54 down below. He addresses this myth on both sides. He also addresses the \"only 4% of CO2 in the atmosphere comes from humans\" claim.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FBF6F4Bi6Sg\n\nOne other thing I want to add is about the people paid by oil companies to find contradictory evidence. Those people are few and far between. That was what oil companies intended to do decades ago, but their scientists came to the same exact conclusion as the government and public scientists.

As you can see it comes from East Anglia (HADCrut).\nThe red line below shows the 11 years solar cycles. If you look closely you can spot the influence of the sunspot count to the flatened dark blue temperature curve. It gives this small wavyness to it. But you can see also the bigger waves which are caused by the 65 years long AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation)\nYou see also the positive and negative spikes in the very fine blue line?

But keep in mind during the little ice age the Thames was frozen over 26 times. So for the nature it sure makes a big difference.

But to be honest I think you're sincere and not doing it on purpose.  So when they say unprecedented they don't mean the drastic change in climate itself.  It's a fact that dinosaurs lived in an atmosphere with even more co2 than what we have.  What's unprecedented is the rate.  Things haven't changed this fast. We know this because for example let's look at ocean acidification.  That happens alongside co2 in the atmosphere. It sets off reactions that, without enough buffers, results in acidification.  And we haven't really seen this before because normally rock and stone would create chemical buffers to additional co2 but that's only if co2 rises slowly. Think of it like an assembly line. Runs smoothly unless you clog it with more than it can process. And that clog. And the rate of the clog. That's what scientists are saying is unprecedented.

But in all fairness the people who make videos to attempt to prove the Earth is flat will almost always get more  Attention then the people who Dispute the flat Earth theory. It's not because the vast majority of people believe the Earth is flat, quite The opposit the vast majority of people know that the Earth is round, it's provable through peer  Reviewed empyrical evidence. Same as climate change being affected by humans.  So when someone comes out with the pseudo science that says it's not we are intrested we want to hear it.  We as humans get satisfaction knowing that there are people so simple minded that they are willing to believe anything. People like you go to OAN and newsmax for information. People like you cannot be helped nor  reasoned with. It's the way the world works  You have average people like me, you have hyper intelligent people like Phil D. Jones, and you have people who probably ate lead paint chips as a child, like you.\nThe paint chippers always think they know more then they do. They often think they aren't easily fooled tho they have fooled themselves into believing they are smarter then they are. They often latch onto insane theorys like pizzagate, obama birther, and trump actually won California. Arguing with a paint chipper often reinforces thier own beliefs. I've watched this happen for you through out all these comments. You've been proving wrong on every point but that hasn't discouraged you, no infact this has emboldened you.

{"cid": "UgyQnhkKHwKypYaHSbB4AaABAg", "text": "Why is it deniers are so smugly wrong and project their complete lack of character onto others and never pay up on their bets? Why do they mindlessly regurgitate Fossil Fuel funded talking points while never understanding them? Here is a bit more of his edited graph that shows correlation more clearly.\r\n\nhttps://i1.wp.com/timescavengers.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1000-2000_co2temp-01.jpg?ssl=1\r\n\r\nHis second graph over millions of years which lacks one important ingredient ie the Sun. When the Sun‚Äôs output is also included there is correlation. So what do you know, another denier who doesn‚Äôt know what the sun is actually doing. Big surprise. Explained below, links to papers in description.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBF6F4Bi6Sg\r\n\r\nSo after using temperature reconstructions which don‚Äôt measure temp directly, he dismisses ice core data because, like his reconstruction, they don‚Äôt measure temperature directly! Then does on to misunderstand the 800 year lag. Then when asked why does increasing temps cause [CO2] to increase he says there are explanations but he doesn‚Äôt buy into them. 800 year lag myth explained below and also in above video:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHozjOYHQdE\r\n\r\nThen lies about the consensus, confirmed by multiple studies:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial\r\n\r\n\r\nThen brings up, not experts in the field ie climate scientists, but a discredited petition funded by the FF industry which has more veterinarian than climate scientists:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py2XVILHUjQ\r\n\r\nThen lies about how study grants work and ignores the money FF executives receive to lie, such as the head of Exxon at $30+ million a year. Or the $100 Billion Kochs. All far more than the top researchers (~$200K ) let alone base level researchers, who all receive far less than their LESS qualified colleagues who work for the FF industry. Then somehow laughably thinks $B is far more than the FF industry‚Äôs $Trillions. Then says you would be sacked if you found AGW to be wrong when the opposite would be the case. You would probably win a Nobel Prize and the FF industry would shower you with riches. Those finding AGW have done so in the face of denier administrations and lost jobs because the Bush, Bush2, Trump etc have not liked reality. NASA and the CSIRO for example have lost massive jobs and had funding cuts because they told the truth and would not follow the official denier narrative.

First, China was the or one of the first places that was effected by covid. But because of strong (and maybe too strong, but that is not what this is about) goverent action, China was able to get it's outbreaks under control. Doing so also allowed it to open it's economy up more. When it was opening it's economy, alot of other economies were closing down. So that also gives china a bit more room in the market.\n\nChina has also prevents major outbreaks like the ones we see in the US via more wrong government action which prevents them from having to fully shut down.\n\nI think the next major out breaks county was Italy.

Since it can take a couple of weeks for all death certificates to be recorded, the numbers for the last two weeks, at least, will increase as time goes by. If the last two weeks produce a similar number of deaths as the weeks before, the margin to this point will actually be close to 310,000.\"\nSource: https://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/health/coronavirus/verify-comparing-total-deaths-from-2020-to-2019-and-2018/501-355b857c-e7e9-40e4-b31d-11500cbcb103", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Snickering Pigeon", "channel": "UCpTagYxxYRTcxa7ay9mA85w", "votes": "8", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRAfCBu66PGWsWcLiqzQtQUlvJxDUY9lvUH-w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I found one case of a Colorado coroner complaining about the fact that all people who died with COVID but not because of it, were classified as \"deaths among cases\". An attentive reader should realise immediatly that this isn't the same thing as being reported as a co-morbidity. Colorado and the CDC differentiate between \"deaths due to COVID19\" and \"deaths among COVID19 cases\".\n\nIt's pretty well explained here:\n\"The state health department says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requires them to report people who‚Äôve died with COVID-19 in their systems because it‚Äôs crucial for public health surveillance.\n\nColorado provides death data related to COVID-19 in two ways:\n\nDeaths due to COVID-19:\nThis is based on CDC coding of death certificates where COVID-19 is listed as the cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death.\n*Deaths among COVID-19 cases:\nThis reflects people who died with COVID-19, but COVID-19 may not have been the cause of death listed on the death certificate.*\nCDPHE explains that they are required to report deaths among COVID-19 cases to the CDC.\n\n‚ÄúThis information is required by the CDC and is crucial for public health surveillance, as it provides more information about disease transmission and can help identify risk factors among all deaths across populations,‚Äù stated CDPHE on its Frequently Asked Questions page.\"\"\nSource: https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/\n\nA few examples of what you could gather from documenting EVERYONE who died with COVID (just from my brain, I'm sure a scientist could explain it properly):\n- Is COVID a risk factor during trauma surgery?\n- Are late stage cancer patients more likely to catch COVID than people from the average population?\n- What is the transmission rate inside of a hospital?\n- What Hospitals/what parts of the country seem to have the best and worst handling of COVID in its hospitals (high transmission rate=bad)? How effective is change x or y?\n- Are there illnesses that do not lead to higher rate of morbidity if the persom contracts COVID?\n- How does COVID interact with hospital germs in infected patients?\n\nLets also not forget this data can be used to trace infection chains, which is probably most important thing to consider here.\n\nLike I said, this is just a random row of examples, some of which might apply, I'm sure I probably missed a lot. There's no reason all people who died with COVID shouldn't be seperately reported (which they are, view quote) in Colorado and internationally.

I'm not a smart-ass, you're just either incredibly stupid or a troll. For my argument, I don't particuarly care if it was 2.6 or 2.8 in 2019. Your artile even says it was 2.9 in 2020 instead od 2.8, so both data points are slightly higher. Your article says these are estimates, the full report for 2019 will be released in 2021 and the one for 2020 in 2022 (read your source). You should expect the numbers to slightly change up or down until then. \n\nFact is, more Americans died in 2020. That is what I wanted and needed to prove. Read your own source, it uses the data of the CDC:\n\"So far, more than 290,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. According to preliminary weekly data from the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), 2,926,129 people have died from all causes between January 1 and November 28 of this year. While this data is preliminary and is incomplete for the last eight weeks, it provides for useful context.\n\nAccording to the same estimates, 2,852,590 people died in 2019, meaning at least 73,000 more people have died so far in 2020 than 2019, despite missing or incomplete data for October through December. If deaths continue at the weekly average of approximately 60,000 per week, at least 240,000 more people would die in 2020, resulting in more than 3.1 million deaths. If the population grew at the same rate in 2020 as in 2019 (0.5%), this would result in a death rate of 9.4 deaths per 1,000, making it the highest death rate in decades.\"\n\nIt's preliminary data.

Dude just make one long comment with breaks and proper punctuation, dont make like 4 comments back to back, flows more easily in one singular comment.\n\nI just read into what you were implying with your iphone comment, you didnt have to actively say it because yall always use the same stupid arguments. Youll call tv evil because its called \"programing\" and not give real arguments.\n\nYoure right, the bible doesnt specify the fruit, but historians and theologians place it as not an apple due to our current form of apple being vastly different from the past. In judaism its generally referred to as a fig, others place it as a pomegranate, wheat, an apricot, a grape, or even a wine made from said grapes.\n\nIf christianity was just the 10 commandments I dont think Id have an issue with it. Hell you could replace every religion with a pamphlet that said \"dont be a dick\" and youd have a more positive outcome since it wouldn't have all that other stuff about how you should be happy to bash babies against rocks and killing people for making a burnt offering the wrong way.\n\nYouve lost the plot because you purport to be about evidence but youre religious, something that has no evidence.\n\nAh I see the Lil Nas X video triggered you. Gotta say finally watched it yesterday and it seems designed to piss you and people like you off. Good for Nas though, being black and gay is a difficult combination especially as a rapper. Personally Im not a fan of rap but the production values were insane.\n\nClutch your pearls harder about Nas after yall simped for a lying narcissistic adulterer like Trump for 5 years.\n\nWould love to see the bit about shoes with human blood. Seeing as how you think using cells from a 1950s cell line for testing is the same as the vaccine being \"full\" of aborted cells, you probably arent a good source for what things are \"made of\"\n\nAnd finally we come to the end, where you ask me how everything began. I could give you some theories but you wont accept them, because you are trying to go for a God of the Gaps argument.\n\nNot knowing how the universe began is not a concession that it must your specific god, you are aware of that right? \n\nHell, we can just go with what lines up with the natural world. One theory involves a massive expansion from a singularity. Another involves the heat death of a previous universe collapsing being the initial singularity for the next universe. The many worlds theory allows for transfer of energy between \"strings\" or barriers of other worlds. Since time and other universal constants didnt exist before the universe then you are looking a potential of infinity for how long it would take for a universe to come into being.\n\nNotice how none of these answers/theories involves magic? Thats why they are more likely and have some amount of standing.\n\nLets say no one knows that answer to 2+2, the one thing you do know is that it is a number, which means you can ignore any answer that isnt a number. This only changes if you are given evidence that a non-number could be the answer.\n\nIf you want to know how the universe began, then the answer must be in line with reality and the universe. It must be something real that can be observed/measured, even hypothetically. God is not that. God is incorporeal, supernatural, God is a non-number in the equation of the universe and is not an appropriate answer.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Douglas Langley", "channel": "UCuLtuHpEAm6Ek9E9WjqHaLA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRmraZ2y-JAI2ONpiUIHvYG7mdQjaMuOFn2WsSuZw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Vaush does this with sociology, and from time to time popular YouTubers post extremely long-form content breaking down and debunking unscientific claims and then explaining the science from the ground up. Shaun posted a multiple-hour video a while back where he just completely took apart the position of race affecting IQ, and even the notion of IQ itself (which was quite interesting to listen to alongside busywork). That was a good example of what we need. The only problem is that just the length of the finished video alone was probably the amount of time the author of the book he was debunking put into the research at all. The sources were garbage and all were quite outdated and questionable, but the author only had to find the conclusions, quickly compile them, and then write out a bunch of fluff to pad it. YouTube videos don't even need to write the fluff unless the presenter is famous or posing as an academic, and even then, a script is comparatively easy to write when you have nothing to say. Compare that to Shaun, who had to meticulously show how bad each source was, debunking all the sources.\n\nIf we don't put all that effort into arguing the science, only assert the truth, then in the eyes of the science denier's audience, at best our assertion is as reliable as the denier's. Science isn't doomed to lose forever, but it is stuck being the side that needs to argue everything, rather than the side that can say something on authority and have it be accepted. That's mainly because of the \"on authority\" part. Scientific research should be and is questioned and re-evaluated as part of the scientific process, but that's a job for the experts, so that process never makes it to the general public. What reaches the general public is quite satisfactory by the steep scientific standards of today, but appears from the outside to be some monolithic \"Science\" entity declaring what is the truth, since nobody sees the internal, highly technical debate that led to the scientific community accepting something.\n\nBasically, science has PR problems due to lack of transparency. Governments can just be more transparent, but science is opaque to anyone who doesn't understand the discussion. Three thousand years ago, anyone could understand Archimedes' \"hey if I put ropes around pulleys like this, I can pull harder, give it a try.\" Good luck explaining the absorption and re-emission of photons by atomic electron clouds to someone who isn't familiar with chemistry or physics and inherently distrusts any scientific assumptions you make without having those assumptions explained in equal depth.\n\nAnd now I've noticed how long this is. I wish I was this comfortable typing important emails.\n\n*TL;DR:* If you don't fully explain the science, the denier's audience will see you've put as much evidence in as the denier, but they already distrust mainstream science, so you can't get far with them without putting a load of effort in.

In this case a chemist might have a more down to earth approach since they could draw comparisons from the mechanical properties of gases. Hell, even the term greenhouse effect itself is an example.

{"cid": "UgwFAUgXhH7NTjc7WKV4AaABAg.9Eok2h1p-d89HwoUBc2t17", "text": "‚Äã¬†@Pomponivs Archibald¬† The difficulty is in the degree of how much someone misunderstands or mistrusts science. If you explain it to a child, they're very likely to accept it, since they have no reason to distrust it beyond just not having heard of the phenomenon before. Now that they have, they're willing to accept that it is the case. The more someone distrusts science, that is, the more fundamental the misunderstanding, the further back you have to go to correct the misunderstanding. If they disagree light works like particles or waves in the first place, good luck getting them to accept that photons can be absorbed, and in that process heat things up. If they have multiple unscientific reasons to believe the greenhouse effect is untrue, then you have to fight through every mechanism of the greenhouse effect, based on things they do accept, or mechanisms you've previously proven to them that way.\n\nFor example, if the only problem is that they think light is your eyes magically probing surfaces, you only have to go as far as proving light is a physical thing you can track through space and which interacts with matter, then you've cleared any misunderstanding and they'll likely accept the conclusion that light is absorbed by air. Science deniers do a lot more than this though, and that's why they're so effective. First they question mainstream science with something like \"they're funded by shadowy cabals\" or \"they won't accept this [garbage] evidence\" or whatever. That leaves the audience open to accepting a different assertion with less difficulty. Then they say something wrong like \"light is not absorbed by air\" and back it up with bad science and intuitive (but unscientific) explanations to cement the idea in the audience's minds. Now not only do you need to show that the sources are garbage, you need to convince them this whole process they believe in is false without making them feel stupid, because you don't want to be mean, but more importantly because they'll reject your argument otherwise.\n\nA scientist or a slightly misguided layman need only have the claim challenged. The paper it's based on being bad science is enough to open them up to a more scientific explanation. It's not rooted in their worldview, unlike someone who has been deceived over a longer period of time on a whole topic. I have an anecdote demonstrating this between me and my dad. He believed that, at the same wattage, some space heaters were more effective than others. This is not true because all electrically-powered heaters are 100% efficient. 1500 watts of electricity in, 1500 watts of heat out. He believed this for two reasons. One was because they varied in price and were designed differently. Why would it be more expensive or designed differently if not to make it better at heating? The other was that he felt some heaters warmed him more than others. Standing in front of different heaters felt different, some feeling much hotter. For reference, a watt is a unit of power, and power is energy over time. A watt-hour is energy over time multiplied by time, so it's an amount of energy. That's why energy bills demand payment per watt-hour. Heating up a room by a degree takes an amount of energy, the time it takes depends on the power. More watts, faster heat.\n\nFirst, I guaranteed him, on my knowledge as a physicist, that all equal power heaters emit the same heat. I cited the laws of thermodynamics in simple words, arguably the most fundamental laws of physics, and explained that the definition of energy efficiency inherently guarantees a heat generator will always be 100% efficient. That last bit was the hardest part, I had to explain that any process that produces energy of any form turns some of the input into heat, and that in the end, no matter what forms of energy a device puts out, it'll all be heat eventually. A fan pushes air around, and the moving air molecules rub against others, the air slows down, and heats up. Regardless of what happens to it, at bare minimum, if a heater sucks some amount of watts out of the power grid, the watts have to go somewhere.\nThen, having established that a heater using 1500 watts is going to output 1500 watts in some form of energy, I had to explain that the design differences may make things feel different initially, but in the end, it will all turn into heat. If the heater uses 100 watts of its power on a fan blowing the heat, the heater might not feel as hot when standing next to it (fast moving air is colder and lower pressure), but the kinetic energy of the air will eventually dissipate and turn into the exact same amount of energy of heat. Standing in front of the heater, you feel the fan instead of the heat, but a thermometer across the room will only notice that at first, 1400 watts of heat are being added, and then soon after, 100 watts of heat start being added as well as the blown air from a moment ago slows down and heats up. 1500 watts total. Smaller heaters feel hotter in front of them because all the heat is coming out at the same spot. Heaters with fans distribute the heat for a more immediate effect on the overall room but a less immediate effect on the area right around them. However, in the long term, all heat the room the same amount.\n\nThen he pretty much accepted it, because I went back as far as his misunderstanding of the science, and he now understands why each feels different. I didn't need to go any further, that was the extent of his misunderstanding. Heaters felt different, so he rationalised why. All I needed to do was give a proper explanation of why and give a very surface level explanation of the assumptions that lead my to explanation being true. After all, he had no reason to question basic thermodynamics, and the result is still an effect he can feel for himself. If he had been convinced that electricity or even energy itself doesn't work the way I say it does, I'd need to go all the way back to proving how those physical concepts work, then break apart his rationalisation based on that misunderstanding, then assert the truth. The longer someone spends deceived by science deniers, the more fortified and widespread their misunderstanding becomes. That's why people who go down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories are so difficult to pull out of the rabbit hole, because they've built an entire worldview based on it, and now you need to meticulously break down every step they went through. You also need to prove your side more than science deniers did theirs, since it's more difficult to prove to a human brain that it's wrong than it is to prove that the brain is right or to give it something new but compatible with its beliefs. That's a concept in psychology termed \"confirmation bias.\"\n\nDang, I did it again.

{"cid": "UgwrKCFhBMm-Ngzvaxd4AaABAg", "text": "Tropical species ranges are also expanding, and temperate species are moving more and more northward. Sessile species like most plants which can only disperse via reproduction have a much more difficult time modifying their ranges in the time scale necessary to remain in their physiological range of tolerance. Also, ocean acidification is a massive problem; the ocean is the largest carbon sink, and overloading the atmosphere with carbon containing compounds since the industrial revolution is driving up the production of carbonic acid in the ocean, thus causing a decrease in ocean pH. The oceans are usually very slightly basic, but are on the way to becoming slightly acidic, and while that may seem small, the pH scale is logarithmic, and many marine organisms which rely on the ability to build calcium carbonate structures will no longer be able to do so if the pH drops even slightly. These organisms make up a large portion of secondary consumers and subsequently a large section of the ocean trophic web, and their extinction would have dramatic cascading effects up the food web. During the Eocene, when atmospheric carbon levels were also uncharacteristically high, there was very very little marine biodiversity because of the relatively low pH. Additionally, environmental health is measured by biodiversity, and not every species benefits from a single standard environmental variable because every species is adapted to a different niche and a different range of tolerance, and the loss of one species or clade can impact the resilience of whole ecosystems. The idea that \"species only go extinct when it gets cold and a warmer earth would just be better for all species\" is not only dramatically stupid but reflects a dangerous amount of ecological ignorance that unfortunately the average person probably isn't equipped enough to sus out.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Emmaline Sheahan", "channel": "UCTu-1QMI1e1h2vTFn3osyKQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRmFvaL32HlaWGpeeHsNHxjJ-quHYAA59X0bg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However based on our current point in the cycle we should be going back down in temperature, and CO2 should be reducing. Except neither of those is happening. The current rise in climate temp is down to greenhouse gases/industrialisation, we just happened to choose the worst time for it because we were already at pretty much peak temps.\n\nReally good video explaining all this https://youtu.be/uqwvf6R1_QY/", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "Sink", "channel": "UC9WR9md_ZxGcpyeyvH7f8ZA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSKOd92TFWaIJvPqb8vpxYyP81ptcWxOxGLkKBQaA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

At the bottom of the huge troughs, at the end of an ice age, the orbital tilt of the earth changes in such a way as to increase the earth's temperature. Sea water, which when cooler retains more CO2, heats up. This means it releases more CO2, so CO2 levels begin to increase. This CO2 increase then causes the temperature to increase rapidly, due to the greenhouse effect, bringing the earth out of an ice age very quickly.

First, the forests in California, as I remember, are mostly owned by the federal government, followed closely by private individuals, think it's like low 50% and mid 40% respectively, with something like 3% owned by California. So this dude wants the government out of the way so individuals can take care of all of it, but a lot of the fires happened on private land. They aren't good, either.\n\nSecond, he said you can't fire up a solar plant with solar, which is technically true but also idiotic. Yes, the first solar plant can't be fired up with solar. After that, yes, you can fire up other solar plants with solar.\n\nLastly, I wish Vaush had stuck with the question of why the governments of the world created this conspiracy in order to control people. Typically, when governments do shit like that, it's for a purpose. Control for the sake of control might make sense in some countries in certain situations, but the majority of major countries? Why would they do that? They would do it for either power or money, and this conspiracy doesn't really work for either. It might help some people get elected, but only because they differ from their opponent on the issue, which is easily rectified if they wanted to. I don't get it.\n\nRegardless, if anyone has questions after this debate, check out potholer's channel.

{"cid": "Ugw_uVI5enLqsnh14BV4AaABAg", "text": "That one graph over 100s of millions of years is misleading, because over that long time scales, the sun's energy output is very relevant. Over its life time, the sun actually became hotter, until it goes into its red giant phase. So when you go further back, the sun was very faint, at least relative to today. The earth was still warm back then since the CO2 concentration was very high, so the two canceled each other out. That's why if you were to correlate CO2 and temperature, you wouldn't get any correlation, just like you wouldn't get any correlation with ONLY the sun and temperature. But if you were to factor in both the sun and CO2, then you do get a fairly good correlation. Potholer54 did a good video on this, but I don't remember which video. I think it was one on christopher monckton.\n\nHe was right about the \"gap\". There is a small delay between temperature rise and CO2 rise, which isn't surprising since the driving force of these cycles is the malinkovitch cycles. When that drives a small increase in temperature, it will lead to a rise in CO2 level from melting permafrost and degassing from the ocean.

He asserted that the empirical data showed temperature lead CO2 levels by 800 years, to which you asked \"Why would rising temperature increase CO2 levels?\".  The mere statement that a given relationship exists among the values reported in the dataset can only be disproven by demonstrating that the claim is incorrect.  The only other possible refutation is that the recorded data is not a faithful representation of the empirical observations claimed.

{"cid": "Ugy7XpvMxSmNwWfHWkh4AaABAg", "text": "28:51 Science teacher here!  Rising temperatures do result in rising CO2 levels.  Cold water is able to trap CO2 better than warm water.  One of the reasons the earth's temperature fluctuates is because the earth \"wobbles\".  The angle of the tilt of the earth's axis fluctuates over time, resulting in warmer and cooler periods.  When this causes a warmer period, it causes the oceans to release CO2, which act as a greenhouse gas and further warm the earth.  This is why we actually see rises in temperatures leading rises in CO2 levels.  \n\nCO2 is both a cause and effect of rising temperatures.  This is one reason there is a temperature threshold we need to keep global average temperatures under.  If the earth gets just a little too warm, it will both cause the oceans to release CO2 and melt the ice caps which reflect some sunlight back into space and release CO2 and other more potent greenhouse gases, further warming the earth.  So if we let the earth get a little too warm, it will result in the earth getting much warmer than the amount predicted by human CO2 emission models alone.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "M Scott Johnson", "channel": "UCTEAnRBrRV-0jtNK-3Ask5g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRKrvgOXDiK5mZHhP2b8cBp8ofqaUsh91aZQIgF4A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The thing is, while stomata are open, the plant is allowing a two way flow of gasses, both in and out, so while the plant is gaining CO2, it is also losing water, in the form of vapor. When it becomes warmer, the plant loses more water when it opens its stomata. Plants have evolved in very interesting and different ways to combat this problem depending on their climate, so as Vaush said, flora and fauna are optimized for their climates. The thing is that CO2 makes up so little of our atmosphere in terms of volume that the extra CO2 is of little benefit to the plants, whereas the detrimental effects of increased average temperatures are much worse for them.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Alex Fauman", "channel": "UCuXqEXgqLyIshKQaz_PV3LQ", "votes": "17", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuKUTF7aM1kP5AVpIeJwX2PRyMijcOU-hC9Xhn=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So which is it? Dead seriously? Then you regurgitate your alarmist claim that we have to be soooooooooo scared of a imaginary mini ice age as we warm!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWlqcePhWjk\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js_M_eHZ5l8\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8RcfHmbIpA\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you conflate YOUR \"modern\" version of FF funded climate pseudo-science for FF funded activists and other dumbasses, with the real climate science such as that done by real scientists at the IPCC.\r The IPCC summarizes ALL research on CC published, where as your alarmist feelings ignore all published data and research for .... feelings, nothing more than feelings................ \n\r\nThen of course you project the fact that today‚Äôs consumers of the FF funded denial mantra are too lazy to learn. It is only a good thing, if it is easy to understand and effortless to use.\r Go to a FF funded blog site, it tells you what to think...YOU like a parrot mindlessly regurgitate. Even it says the opposite 5 minutes later.\n\r\nThen you add a smattering of strawman arguments and made up lies to try to give the appearance that your cult is somehow less crazy than it actually is. This can be seen by your refusal to look at evidence while you reply in minutes with other blowhard bragging about your own self perceived ‚Äúgenius‚Äù, feelings and occasionally ‚Äúproof‚Äù, which generally turns out to show the opposite of what your feelings claim.\r\n\r\nYour other arguments on this thread have been a similar mix of lies and strawman arguments and massive contradictions. Some include that we have been cooling since 2003, we‚Äôve warmed. How temps are easy to fudge, again without any proof and just feelings. So you claim we must look at ice extent since 1979 because that can‚Äôt be fudged. It‚Äôs melted and temps have risen. Then to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that ice has melted you link a graph of temp, not ice, but temps in the Arctic. That you previously claimed were easily fudged and can‚Äôt be trusted. Trusted when you THINK they agree with you and not trusted when they DON‚ÄôT. \r\n\r\nAnd here‚Äôs a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù, the graph you linked showed temps INCREASING not decreasing as you claimed. LMAO. Up is down in YOUR pseudo-scientific alt-world of alternative, multiple contradicting coexisting universes. Then you once again tried to walk back your demanded comparison of post 1979 by complaining the satellite data, which started when the satellites were launched in 1979‚Ä¶.didn‚Äôt have satellite data BEFORE they were launched!!! And you can‚Äôt figure out why LMAO  So it had to be another tinfoil hat conspiracy to ‚Äúget‚Äù self important little old alt-genius YOU.\r\n\r\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ice-sheets/\r\n\r\nhttps://woodfortrees.org/plot/wti/plot/wti/trend\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if 30 billion tons of FF waste a YEAR is such a \"tiny bit\" then let them dump that \"tiny bit\" on you and leave the rest of us alone right?\n\nRight Rocky?\n\nYep all the planets are warming so that explains the WARMING on earth!!!! Except you lied and they are NOT all warming. BUT then you flipped and lied and claimed the OPPOSITE ie that earth is cooling‚Ä¶as it warms.

Second, it is well understood that high clouds will move into higher regions of the atmosphere as it warms, making them more effective blankets.

The NAO brings about a 0.1 degrees C drop. What he omitted was the AOM, which brings another 0.3 degrees drop. So we are at 0.7 already. So my prediction of 0.5 degrees decrease is not just a fantasy story. \nBut yes, it will be no where near a little ice age, but since the warming he mentions by the CO2 does not happen it will not compensate this cooling at all.

And this will happen in only ten to 15 years. \nEverybody will be able to see and feel it without to use a thermometer. \nIf there will be negative effects from that we don't know. Longer winters and shorter summers will make a small loss in crop yields possible but it will not be severe.\nBut one effect of that cooling is 100% certain.

You should show respect or acknowledge your actions in some way. If you view a forest and trees as nothing but clumps of wood, leaves, and animals to be slaughtered then why would you care if it gets destroyed for profit? Why would you care if a river gets so poluted to the point it can be set on fire if it is coincidentally there and you can profit from it. If we were given dominion over other animals and their fate how are they any different than some allowance our parent gives us?\n\nAnimism adds value to things in a way that demands more caution and respect. A forest isn't just an opportunity for profit or a way to limit climate change if you view it as something full of life. Earth as a collection of atoms doesn't inspire the same feeling of \"we should take care of this\" as Mother Gaia.\n\nWhen I think of the optimal fusion of human society/technology and nature it ends up looking a bit like Hoenn from Pokemon Sapphire. They build tree houses as to limit the damage they do to a forest because the forest is just an important part of nature. They stop construction when it will be actively harmful to the planet and creatures within it.\n\nI meant it jokingly originally but I do think a lot of the issues humanity faces is because Christians generally making the world seem lifeless and for humans to shape at will.

The roads stretch out like veins transporting resources and the communication infrastructure acts like the nervous system. If humans died out, society dies with it. There is a homeostasis that must be maintained otherwise it collapses and ceases to be. Societies can branch off into other distinct societies, thus propagating.\n\nMeanwhile, you look at the planet with its fauna, and the planet exists regardless of the fauna.

I specifically said that Christianity doesn't utilize the concept (except for that not even 1% of Celtic Christians which is Paganism-lite.)\n\nAnd honestly, our definitions are probably not the same here. I use animism as an extra reason to show compassion to nature. Part of animism is that everything has a soul and in part, everything is alive and deserves respect and at least some level of reverence. I think that any given crystal, tree, frog, bird, or person are all alive and have souls and deserve respect and dignity (except ted cruz.)\n\nYou phrased it as something living I phrased it initially as having a soul but I believe it is almost the same. They have some kind of life-force or should be seen as having one. We shouldn't kill an animal or cut down a tree or even dam a river without some type of acknowledgement that it is a living being similar to ourselves and however we treat it will have consequences for the world and ecosystem.\n\nChristians view the earth as something humans basically own. The only thing with souls are humans and Yhwh + crew. The forest nearby is only there to serve humans. These cows are meant to supply food for us. These rivers are there to make sure we can get water. And Christianity has dominated Western culture and thought. I would argue this even affects atheists or has similarities to atheism. You have to add compassion into these ideologies to preserve nature rather than it being inherent to animism.\n\nAnimism inherently limits how much you should be able to do to the environment for personal gain. A forest isn't there solely as a pool of resources humans get to decide how to use. But a forest is a living breathing creature that should we abuse will have negative consequences we probably don't know about (I doubt they knew cutting down whole forests in the 1800s would contribute to climate change.) We should respect it because it is alive and has potential. We need resources like food, wood, land, etc but we shouldn't take it without consideration.

Tell me how the ozone hole over Antarctica formed naturally. I can tell you how we caused it...in the link! \n\n\"Human emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons (bromine-containing gases) have occurred mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. About 90% have been released in the latitudes corresponding to Europe, Russia, Japan, and North America. Gases such as CFCs and halons, which are insoluble in water and relatively unreactive, are mixed within a year or two throughout the lower atmosphere. The CFCs and halons in this well-mixed air rise from the lower atmosphere into the stratosphere mainly in tropical latitudes. Winds then move this air polewardboth north and south from the tropics, so that air throughout the global stratosphere contains nearly equal amounts of chlorine and bromine.\"\n\nDu Pont, a chemical company that was producing CFCs and halons gases, volunteered to limit or stop their production of CFCs and halon gases before the government(s) took action.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/26/business/behind-du-pont-s-shift-on-loss-of-ozone-layer.html\n\nNow imagine if what I said as a hypothetical joke were to happen, with all the nukes going off in Antarctica...what do you think would happen? I can safely say that there would be little of it left, the fall out radiation would not only do radioactive fuckery in our atmosphere in the south-pole, but also spread throughout the southern hemisphere via wind travel. Now with all the heat of the nukes melting away the ice, I'd say the worse to come from that is the coast lines of the southern hemisphere (if not further north) being underwater.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Hey, It's Ya Boi", "channel": "UC08sJgvWaSFIE8yvDW5hIPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaQvGIGQ6pJhuOWyEuNNVpbQFzMj44LDy38dv12A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It showed the ozone hole starting out in 1986.\n\"Scientists just discovered the ocean hold twice as much c02 as previously thought (because scientists aren't infallible). \"\nhttps://www.intelligentliving.co/oceans-twice-as-effective-absorbing-co2/\nHowever, our oceans do absorb more than just CO2. In two somewhat related studies, we reported on just how much heat the oceans may be absorbing, and how an overabundance of CO2 has caused mass toxic algae growth. An international team of researchers had calculated that the oceans collectively absorb heat at a rate of 5 atom bombs per second. In the Canary Islands, another team found that toxic algae blooms happen when CO2 in the water reached high levels.\r\n\r\nSo while one positive may be that a large mass of CO2 is sunk into our oceans, two negatives may be how quickly they are heating up and the overall marine life which could be lost prior to the CO2 sinking. As tends to be the case with ecosystems, a delicate balance is often required to ensure a harmonious environment.\nThe ocean doesn't work the same way as plants do (photosynthesis) where the more CO2 (from exhaling) we give plants, the more O2 they give us.\n\"They also found out magma can move a lot quicker from inside the earth to the surface. I'm not even talking about actual volcanic activity but magma just below the crust of the earth which would heat the earth and the oceans. Scientists have already stated they need to rethink how magma operates.\"\nThen let's cut our emissions so that the oceans are only affected by the magma without excess CO2 going into the ocean. I know, me suggesting to cut CO2 emmisions will most likely prompt you to go WhY bOtHeR!? Because we want to buy ourselves more time to adjust to the inevitable change to our climate. We've already passed the point of no return and we can't go back to how things used to be before we made climate change a major issue because of the hesitation and negligence of our leaders.\n\"We didn't cause the laurentide ice sheet or the thermal maximum and they were insane  demonstrations of climate change. Magnetic North is moving more than scientists predicted which means the inside of the earth is moving in ways we've never seen before.\"\nYou're talking about those instances as if what we can do will make no difference (not even my nuking Antartica joke), I beg to differ:\nhttps://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=jest.2016.301.316\nNOTE: if the images in the article don't load, just right-click the box and hit load image, it should work.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Hey, It's Ya Boi", "channel": "UC08sJgvWaSFIE8yvDW5hIPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaQvGIGQ6pJhuOWyEuNNVpbQFzMj44LDy38dv12A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
