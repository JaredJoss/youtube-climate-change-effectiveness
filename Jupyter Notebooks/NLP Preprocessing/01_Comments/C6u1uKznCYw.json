He also didn‚Äôt stutter at all. It‚Äôs very rare to gain stutter just suddenly when has spoken perfectly all his life up until now, when he obviously became older. Thats why it‚Äôs very likely that all of his speech issues is as a result of some age related issue, which many doctors have pointed out is likely dementia. Whether it‚Äôs actually a disease (which in that case would likely be dementia) or not is up for discussion.

{"cid": "Ugz5-ehRL5rkptCvk-54AaABAg", "text": "Who is this guy? (incoming rant‚Ä¶) YOU LOST...your way long ago and now grasp to take others with you. The planet did not ask you to save her. She is fine, and needs no saving especially from your poppycock. It is Humans who are in trouble, probably from being tricked by this guy and many like him for years that ‚Äúpromised the world‚Äù (planet). But when in power they implement more ways to aid in the destruction, of earth and humanity just to line their own pockets. Your talk of ‚Äúsaving the planet‚Äù is actually just your own egotistical viewpoint and you are only using the subject to try to gainer support by pulling on human emotions. Which you appear to not have. I sense no sympathy in your plea, I sense no real emotion in your scripted ramblings. I am concerned for the planet, and for the humans and all the creatures here and your misinformed panic and fear porn does not effect us. All humans want a clean, safe environment to live in, but you do not name one single thing you would implement to help anyone. There is not one solid idea that you thought of or championed that ever helped anyone but your own interests. You are a failure, and you have done nothing to help the planet or its occupants. Ever. (prove it) You speak a lot of poppycock and try to play ‚ÄúScience Says‚Äù with the people. Hoping we are dumb enough to play along and to believe ‚Äúyour science‚Äù VS ‚ÄúTrue Science‚Äù You and you government friends even toy with humans lives and livelihoods following ‚Äúyour science‚Äù  during a very bad Common Cold(coronavirus) pandemic. AND somehow think you that YOU can save a planet? Some arrogance! You can‚Äôt even save yourself! The planet will be here long after humans have faded into a missing link. To be honest you only care about the habituated areas and how YOU and your buddies can make money off fixing the mess your own failed policies produced. The wildfires you speak of are not from climate change, it is obviously from not allowing proper forest management to occur. Giant fires have happened throughout history, documented for thousands of years, some much larger than the ones we have seen in our lifetimes. Today a fire might effect more people than in the past, which should be planned for, however to claim that climate change is creating bigger fires is False. (Fact Check: Research Wild Fires, Large Fires, Forest Fires, etc.  Pre-1900) Flooding of large scale populated areas has more to do with people building in potential flood zones, not climate change. (Fact Check: Research Dried river basins and flood plains developed for habitation.) The climate changes on its own without any human intervention, (Fact Check: Research Seasons, History of Mini Ice Ages, Grand Canyon, Volcanoes, Solar Minimums / Maximums, etc.) There are many of us who see through your MALARKEY, so so many. You and your ilk love your ‚ÄúScience says‚Äù game; Science says- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wear a mask, you can get germs on it with your fingers‚Äù. Science says- ‚ÄúDO wear a mask, (unless you are a policy maker)‚Äù.  Real science says to ‚ÄúQuestion Everything‚Äù but when we question ANYTHING then you gaslight us with terms like ‚ÄúClimate Denier, Conspiracy Theorist, AntiVaxer,  and other even more derogatory titles. A lot of people have been harassed, discredited, fact checked, canceled; removed from Social media for simply linking an actual scientific study or news story that does not jive with what ‚ÄúSCIENCE SAYS‚Äù ‚Ä¶ your junk science. Even prominent Doctors, scientists, engineers, and Presidents have been blocked or completely removed from the discussion. Very similar to how the Poll Challengers were forced out of many ballot counting locations across USA recently, just for doing their job. The validation of Data, error checking. Save the planet!

They have put together an organization to combat voter fraud. He describes it if you keep listening. Iwillvote.com to make a plan to vote and the number to call with over 1,000 lawyers on the line. This is in response to limiting the number of early voting sites to sometimes one per county (Kentucky), removing mail dropboxes so people can't vote by mail (Texas) rather than catch covid and potentially die by going to overcrowded polling places (again, overcrowded because the GOP tries to have as few early voting sights as possible), trying to stop legally cast ballots from being counted (as Trump literally filed a lawsuit to try and do in Pennsylvania, alleging that they did not have access to the process. Not true, it was proven in court and even admitted by Trump's lawyers that those representing the Trump campaign were present as poll watchers). Then there was the Proudboys \"stand back and stand by comment,'' the incidents of armed Trump supporters planning to show up at certain polling locations, the Trump encouragements for his supporters to show up and watch on voting day, which some interpreted as potential voting intimidation. Also, Trump has complained about the nonexistent vote by mail fraud for a long time, when his own commission under Mike Pence found I believe 3 cases NATIONWIDE. Can't you see he was setting up his excuse when he lost? That's exactly what he's doing now. I was told for 4 years that Donald Trump was the duly elected President of the United States, and I accepted that and even supported him for the first 1-2 years. It was when I rejected his division and bad policy that I was called a \"sore loser,\" even though I was ecstatic that he won at first. People went so far as to say that I couldn't even disagree with him, and if I did I was somehow rejecting the fact that he was elected. I'm not going that far now, you're entitled to your 1st Amendment rights, you can agree and disagree with whoever you want. The only thing that should be followed here is the same standard that it was insisted I follow, and that I did from the beginning, Joe Biden is now the duly elected President-elect of the United States of America, just as Donald Trump was the duly elected President-elect of the United States in 2016.

Biden and Kamala will bring normalcy, calm, integrity, diversity, truth, leadership and much needed direction to the white house and country unlike what Trump was able to provide putting ppl against each other dividing, stirring hate with his language and pretty much doing whatever he wants no more of that and finally he can take his twitter fingers somewhere the fuck else, that dude was really fucking annoying by the end of it.

You really think they are going to change AN ENTIRE election lol. At most they might be able to toss out some votes but to change an entire election where Biden won by 6 million more overall votes come on even you can't be that stupid to actually believe they will reverse that for Trump lol?? Even if 100 witnesses say they saw something, what does that prove lol?? They are still just saying they saw something without actual concrete evidence to back it up. What makes these ppl credible, that a JUDGE should take their word for it and what they produce?? Who are they lol?? \n\nAnyone can say anything if their proof was so strong they would be winning cases. However, they are all still being thrown out of legal courts which they should be on the count of the claims are baseless not actually consisting of anything worth looking into of substance or reversing, just a bunch of sore losers reaching because Trump is about to be out. I am okay with Biden winning cuz he got 80 million votes 6 million more or so than Trump, Biden got the majority it was not even close actually. Biden won LEGALLY in the electoral college as well and Trump just can't handle that HE LOST!!. I'm okay with Biden winning as everyone who voted for Trump was in 2016 when it appeared Russia helped him win, Trump ppl didn't care that time about others looking into that they just accepted he was winner so what's the difference now?? Cuz now its not going for your guy lol??\n\nYa take all the time that you need but Biden actually needs to get in there sooner rather than later to start making his transition as HE IS PRESIDENT ELECT ALREADY regardless of what you ppl and Trump think, the Biden team don't have time to dick around and cater to Trump and his ppl who are still in denial and being babies about losing. Important issues need to be attended to and Trump won't do shit about them he just golfs all day he was never fit to be president, its a serious job with real issues he never took seriously. So Biden has to get in there as a president to be SHOULD BE ALLOWED to in terms of getting information for his team to start fixing the Trump mess he has left for him. Starting with Trump's biggest failure the CORONAVIRUS which Trump and his ppl/base care nothing about but is a very serious issue with lives at stake to the rest of us. So if that's okay with you Biden and his team need that info and those briefings from the Trump team to start fixing the colossal fuck up Trump has left the country in which includes having the most virus cases and deaths in the world btw if you were not aware. \n\nIts okay Trump can continue having his super spreader rallies spreading his germs/lies but just far away from the WHITE HOUSE and away from ppl who actually care about other Americans and their health and well being. Trump can have his rallies with all the selfish misinformed, entitled ppl, who feel the election was Trump's god given right to win and to have.

You ppl act like there is no PANDEMIC VIRUS going on and the USA don't lead the world in it. BIDEN PPL SUPPORTED and support him now from a far cuz they actually care about the health and well being of others unlike Trump morons. Trump is a thief/crook and can't wait to see him outta there with all the lawsuits he has coming for him, especially regarding his taxes. Also not sure if you knew Trump wears a diaper and shits himself constantly, did you ever hear of #DiaperDon its a real thing go check it out. \n\nYes Biden got the most votes in history for an incoming president, shows you how much ppl didn't want your buddy Trump, time to take his act on the road, ppl are tired of seeing his clown show in the White House, that's mainly why Biden got all those votes and Obama endorsed him and went on the campaign for him. People wanted to make sure they came out this time to vote cuz many didn't last time and look what happened Trump got elected, so this time they came out to vote for the other guy to make sure that didn't happen this time around again. Yup Obama campaigned for BIDEN hello lol its obvious ppl who voted for Obama and wanted Obama las time would vote for Biden now, except this time they told everyone to MAKE SURE TO GET OUT AND VOTE which they did and in huge numbers VOTE VOTE VOTE and vote early that was their message from the Biden campaign, its like Trump ppl were on another planet they did not see this is what Biden's team was preaching the whole time. Now Trump and his ppl wanna cry about it cuz all they did was attend super spreader rallies in a world wide pandemic and came out in person to vote and expected that was going to be enough to win lol ya FAIL!!!\n\nBIDEN HAS THE MOST VOTES IN HISTORY FOR A PRESIDENT ELECT, that speaks volumes to just how much support he had from a far. Those ppl who filled the venues to hear Trump speak spread the coronavirus bravo good for them lol. Also they must have wasted their time cuz Trump didn't really say anything worth listening to at those rallies. RALLY SIZE DOES NOT DETERMINE SUPPORT LOL!!!keep that in mind. Biden ppl actually STAYED AWAY from huge rallies and crowds because of the VIRUS out there which Trump ppl never gave a shit about including Trump himself. THIS DOES NOT MEAN Biden did not have a huge following. Which you saw the Biden ppl come out once they announced he won. They celebrated his victory on the streets and you saw some of his support there for A VICTORY CELEBRATION, which they were entitled to whenever a candidate wins a presidential election, or is projected to win. Before that they took precautions which EVERYONE should be doing considering the US lead the world in coronavirus cases and deaths.

Get that through your head. Trump can do whatever he wants IT WON\"T WORK LOL!! IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE HE IS A LOSER and always has been. I'm telling you Biden is president ELECT and has been for almost a month now! In case you were not aware. BIDEN team don't have time to dick around and play footsie with Trump and his team of delusional morons who keep enabling his behavior. They have to start getting their info and briefings to LEAD AND DIRECT the country unlike the Trump team was able to do. They gotta start with fixing the virus pandemic problem Trump left for them with his inability to lead a country because he was unfit to be in office. \n\nYOU ARE NOT INFORMED because all you do is watch and listen to what the Trump team, Rudy, and right wing media says which are all blatantly biased towards Trump you can't even take them seriously. Trump still has not won shit in any courts in terms of his lawsuits that is the reality and that STILL TO THIS DAY has not changed. When it does come back and talk to me, until then its just a WITCH HUNT with no proof of anything and no concrete evidence of nothing that they can prove in a court of law. The courts don't take conspiracy theories, baseless/false claims, and lies lightly so that's why NOTHING is going to work for the Trump team. You can say whatever the fuck you want as well still not gonna change the fact BIDEN IS PRESIDENT ELECT RIGHT NOW as we speak!!! and will be the next president come January 2021 along with Kamala Harris as VP. \n\nWhen and if Trump even gets to the supreme court I will come back and LAUGH at you if he do not succeed so you better hope he does I will be watching, but he ain't gonna reverse shit I'm confident in that. 80 million plus Americans have spoken and once again THEY WANT BIDEN, they are tired of the Trump shit show at the White House.

NO EVIDENCE again was proven in the courts of law as i figured would happen, all it was was made up lies, conspiracy theories from the extreme right and misinformation from Trump all mixed together that caused all this confusion Biden won FAIR AND SQUARE a month ago already as I have said all along. The courts dismissed baseless claims cuz they weren't based on anything lol as I mentioned even the SUPREME COURT didn't hear it that should tell you something. Courts dismiss false evidence that can't be proven FACTUAL that's what happened man. \n\nAlso if half the country is mad about it then that's how it is now they know how the left felt when they didn't want Trump and felt that Russia helped him win it goes both ways right. Biden deserves the chance to fix Trump's wrongs that's for sure. He left the country in a disaster with much more hatred and division and a virus mess lets be honest about that. Fraud has to be proven factual in the courts to mean anything remember that, and this \"alleged fraud wasn't\". So cuz half the ppl thought it was fraud the other half who thought it was legit don't matter. Their voices count too right especially if they feel they won or their candidate won fair and square you know. They evidence were FALSE CLAIMS that's why they weren't allowed to be heard in courts my friend that's how these things work. They gotta be based on REAL FACTS not allegations.  The court REJECTS FALSE CLAIMS dude that's not hard to understand. \n\nSo because some ppl seen some random evidence of something it makes it true?? That don't mean anything dude the courts if you can prove its not false allegations that's where it becomes true and something different. Makes no sense no mail in ballot lol. Some people prefer to vote that way so I don't agree with that especially now with the virus it was the preferred/safest way to vote for Biden people who didn't wanna be in the crowds, so I do not agree and many other wouldn't agree to that either. Can't compare wal mart to voting lol. Its an essential service right ppl have a right to buy groceries and other essentials to survive do they not lol??? So that makes no sense that comparison. Investigations may continue but again won't find anything cuz its all based on false claims starting from Trump and his people as I have been saying and has been proven true all along. You and many others can see a full investigation of the machines and ballots but I do not think its fair to subject people who voted for Biden and feel they won fair and square to that. Or do you just care about \"your\" people. People who voted for Biden are Americans too you know and their vote counts no matter how your people feel.  They block the requests because there is no need the election was fair and free and Biden won they won't allow requests based on false allegations not proven in court of fraud you get me??  machines and ballots do belong to the people and the people have spoken that Biden has won and will be the next president. All this wasn't done last election by dems or ppl on the left for Trump so why should it be now?? They aren't hiding nothing NO FRAUD WAS EVER PROVEN COURT, but why subject Biden people who FEEL the have won to a recount or checking ballots and other things? just to please Trump and his ppl?? What makes them special and above Biden people for this?? \nYes Happy 2021 to you and be safe, hope you can deal with it when Trump is gone soon times here. Biden will be the next president and Kamala very soon can't wait for the inauguration I'm counting down the days to that and new leadership as are many others who feel the same way I do about a new direction and real leadership for the country.

{"cid": "UgzG46hKA2607jK766N4AaABAg.9GLPTJtd05f9IHnIkTbDD5", "text": "¬†@Anthony Fernandez¬† Yes its okay to censor/cancel people who incite violence, threats and are a danger to the society and the general public. Also people who are irresponsible with their words such as the president was you know, they had no choice because the ppl following him are ready to be violent just because he wants that or incites them to be that way. If you are speaking normally not using dangerous or threatening language you should never be censored imo. \n\nIt is what it is though, people have to be held accountable for the things they say and do. Obviously I don't like censorship but for some people it is a must because they are unhinged and should not be allowed to just spew hatred, division, lies and violent/dangerous language against others who oppose them without any consequences. This cannot happen in 2021, maybe in 1945 but not in 2021 my friend, the world is different now every person no matter who you are has a voice. Censorship isn't good with that I will agree with you however, for some people they are just asking for it and not taking any responsibility for the things they say and how much damage those words cause. It has to start somewhere for these people to learn this is not how you should treat and speak about others who differ from you, many STILL in 2021 have not learned this concept as you can see and have chosen not to accept reality. The world isn't just White anymore you know.  Okay buddy, good luck to you be safe but one word of advice to you man. Trump was not answer to all the problems going on in America its good that he is on his way out. For all we know Biden may not be either, however he does deserve the chance to show how he can lead and direct the country from the mess its in now. He wants peace, tranquility, acceptance, unity and calmness in America you should want the same things as he does if you want a better country for the world to use as an example. If you feel that strongly that Biden and the democrats are going in the wrong direction then I would suggest becoming an independent my friend because The Republican party who basically were puppets for Trump the last 4 years are FOR SURE not the answer to the problems the country faces, they just lie to you and tell you what you want to hear while pushing their own agendas.  if you don't think the democrats are the answer for the future then I would suggest being someone who supports neither just my advice to you okay buddy good luck out there be well and all the best. Remember at the end of the day no matter what side of the isle you fall ALL people matter and EVERY vote is important. To the future of the country, whether for Trump or for Biden.

They were a lot larger, so they had a wider range of classes, and students from my college would take classes at the other university.

Yes he has , but his actions are what matter . He vetoed the Super Predator crime bill , he got the economy strong and unemployment for blacks and people of color the lowest unemployment in years , he stopped the kids in cages , after Melania told him to.  He's not perfect but at least he doesn't just tell everyone what they want to hear.  He actually does something about it . Obama bailed out all the big banks while kicking 5.1 million people out of their homes . The left only cares about making you feel good with speeches.  They only want our vote.

You only see what you wanna see Trump is a racist and he don't like ppl that aren't white if you didn't see that in the research you must not be very good at it then lol and I can't help you there. \n\nBiden and Obama have a much better character for president than Trump that's what most ppl care about they don't put ppl down if you don't agree with them or call them names or be a bully and tweet all day wtf is that for a president. Biden has not been president in 47 years this will be his first time in there as president and he will have a chance at fixing the mess the country is because of Trump and his administration. Trump don't know how to treat people that is his biggest problem and you gain a lot of enemies that way. Look at all the ppl he has fired all those ppl are against him now who were once for him. Also even if Trump did some good things or passed some good things all that was drowned out with the hatred and division he has caused in this country between the left and right who now pretty much can't stand each other and attack one another when around each other. It was not like this before he added fuel to the fire for his political show and didn't give a fuck about others who he disrespected. \n\nHis biggest downfall was how he handled Covid in case you are not aware the US leads the world in cases and deaths because Trump chose to ignore the virus and its seriousness with his rallies and saying its no big deal and telling dumbass ppl to drink bleach to make it go away. You know how many families lost loved ones because HE DID NOTHING in terms of prevention and instructing the country how to navigate this virus as a president or any leader should do? There is no getting around that and that alone means he failed as a president. Not to mention he had no social distancing and barely any masks for any event or briefing he held furthermore, infected the white house and those around him even those who worked for him with the virus without a care in the world, the guys a selfish idiot like his base and nothing you say will change my mind about that. He just needs to help Biden transition in as the next president now but he won't even do that as any normal president would do once they lost so he needs to get out of there, bottom line. 78 million ppl plus are fed up with him and his supporters they don't want to see him or them anymore. Biden and his team have to go in the white house and disinfect and wipe down everything because the virus has spread there and who knows how many surfaces its on thanks to Mr. Trump and his selfish egotistic attitude.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "Matthew R", "channel": "UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSFak2hZnhdJgawUkDysUlzklKEtXoLiHtQw_As=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Trump can't handle that and his ppl are still in denial/shock he actually is going to lose. \n\nNow Trump is trying to block the Biden team from getting critical information for the virus to save American lives, reverse shit in his favor when clearly Biden won, throw out millions of LEGAL votes for Biden cuz he don't understand what mail in ballots are and being a dick trying to put pro republican ppl everywhere attempting to call senators and reps to not allow certification of LEGAL wins in States and he even tried to get his ppl to take away mail slots prior to the election to discourage voting that way. HE IS DOING ALL THIS SHIT OUT IN THE OPEN trying to steal/fraud an election so ya, that's what I care about. Biden and Kamala will be in the White House January 2021 can't wait, tired of Trump his ppl and their antics the Republicans would not accept his behavior if it were the other way around. You can tell your mom that the person she voted for and the dems did not cheat nothing to worry about there, Biden will become the 46th president of the USA and how sweet that is to say.  \n\nAlso, question for you did Trump ppl wait till the investigation was over in 2016 if Russia helped Trump win before declaring him the winner?? No I don't think so they just accepted it and called the investigation a witch hunt, exactly what this is right now a witch hunt. So what is the difference now, cuz its not going well for Trump lol?? Everyone else is supposed to wait for this witch hunt to declare Biden winner?? When in 2016 Trump or his ppl didn't give two shits about an on going investigation into Russian help to get him elected. At the time they said no we are the winner we don't care about no investigation its nonsense. So ya Biden won that's just what it is no matter what they do the result will not change, I'm confident that Biden won and LEGALLY too.  The right and the republicans are a big bunch of hypocrites and liars who are in denial enabling Trump's sore loser/selfish attitude because he did not win.

Oh and the biggest one of all Trump completely fucked how he handled the virus  the US lead the WORLD in cases and deaths, Trump ignored the virus for months and ignored scientists and shamed them. He held rallies and briefings WITH NO social distancing OR masks when he knew how serious this thing was. So uhhhhh ya I will stick to my original statement thanks. That's not even getting into what he did by separating children from their families WHO THEN COULD NOT REUNITE with their families because they did not know where they were or where they were being kept/held. Now Biden has to go in there FOR THE FIRST TIME as president and fix Donald's mess and how he left the country, and on top of that Donald is being a BIG SORE LOSER/baby right now and not even helping Biden's transition like any other normal president would do he is only being difficult and delaying the process while still totally ignoring the HUGE pandemic problem going on.

Research how long it takes to get a mine going and the output of every copper mine on the planet and take demand up 50% per year and it is game over in 5-6 years.  All these guys are clowns and they think that mining is evil on top of it and believe me they all use diesel fuel by the billions of gallons and with US oil production falling off a cliff which was responsible for 80% of the worlds oil production increase over the last 10 years you will understand we are off the cliff with oil.  How are you going to mine when oil is $200 a barrel?  How will the economy function? It is limping now at $40.00 or less per barrel.  Read and read more you will understand we are near the end of the days of cheap energy.

For example, if he feels that Arizona will be fore Biden, they call it as a blue state. And yes, that is an important thing to keep in mind. They called Arizona for Biden way to early. Conservative voters didn‚Äôt even care to vote because they see that they are so far behind. And you know what‚Äôs funny about people who talk shit ONLY about Fox News. Those are the same people who claim to watch real news, then go home and watch CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, NPR, Vox, etc. And by the way, Tucker Carlson is one of the few Fox people that states out right factual information.

But if you want to think that they are dumb enough to say to journalist that they will prevent people from voting, that's your choice. And I'm sorry I can't agree with you on that one, if you have read the definition of voter suppression, how does it fit in ? It is basic strategy to win an argument, either you give a better argument or you discredit your opponent or your opponent's argument, which is what they did thanks to the predator video of Ms. Hillary. Now when trump says don't vote with mail because mailbox won't be sanitized...I can agree it sounds like voter suppression, even if he is not actually telling them to not vote at all. And finally to your example, i understand what you mean, but you gotta keep in mind that everyone is not a die hard trump supporter or a die hard Biden supporter, and that kind of move is to get those people who are swinging from dem to rep or rep to dem... Finally if the people are indeed discouraged to vote because of what they saw about their candidate, maybe there is a problem about that candidate.

Were you there to see exactly how they did everything in all places lol? What's problematic is you have a sitting president who won't accept/acknowledge a loss and is still not telling his base he lost furthering their delusions/denial. No where in history has a US president acted the way this guy is acting right now, that's what he will be remembered for the guy who would not leave on his own accord, they gotta drag him outta there, he thought it would be his house forever. Most presidents would help the other guy transition in after a loss, not this guy though. Biggest sore loser and baby I have ever seen. Republicans and ppl around him are just accepting this type of behavior too when if it was the other way around they would be all over the guy for acting this way. He can't even be decent and congratulate Joe on the win. Losing with dignity was never in the cards for Trump. Even other world leaders are starting to accept Biden is the new guy and even ppl around Trump are telling him to concede I mean what more does this guy need to know he won't be the guy anymore, how dense is he? he lost lol, its okay it happens. \n\nAlso its not Biden's fault that Trump spoke ill of mail in votes discouraging his base from voting that way causing them to mainly vote in person. Biden was smart to use mail in votes for his base mainly because of the PANDEMIC which Trump and his ppl seem to be unaware of or not giving a shit about that is going on. Good on Biden and his base they listened to advice from doctors and from the Biden team did their thing with the mail in votes came out in huge numbers for it to get Trump out. While the Trump ppl just listened to Trump his campaign and largely ignored advice from anyone outside of these ppl including the media. They came out the day of the election and pretty much that's it, now they wanna cry about a loss. Its done time is limited for Trump it will be his white house no longer in about two months time. Time to turn the page on Mr. One Term and welcome change, peace, tranquility, calm and direction back to the white house, the clown show is almost over.

They USED mail in votes cuz the world is in the middle of a pandemic with the US having really bad numbers that's what everyone except Trump ppl know apparently lol. They also knew alot of ppl would vote against Trump and asked their people to vote that way so THEY DID NOT COME IN TO CONTACT with the virus going into the crowds to vote like Trump ppl did without a care in the world for others. Biden surpassed expectations 81 million PLUS PPL voted for him most votes in president elect history to get that crook Trump out of the White House. The whole world knows Trump is a thief and a liar who puts down his allies. His family are a bunch of cons as well. Yes the world does know this now its clear more than ever with his sore loser babyish attitude and the attitude of his lunatic base who are threatening violence against democrats and those who voted for Biden and are celebrating his win. \n\nThe video where they apparently locked out Republicans has been debunked and you sound like another conspiracy theorist. LIES, MISINFORMATION, BASELESS CLAIMS, and YOUR THEORIES don't hold up in the courts of LAW. That's why Trump is winning NO CASE and they can't prove their so called evidence in the courts. In court you cannot LIE and say whatever you want as \"FACT\" sorry lol. Show me where this so called \"evidence\" and videos they have are apparently PROVEN TO BE FACTUAL in the court of law show me a LINK where it has been proven in the court to be true and where the Trump team are winning these cases?? I will wait....or are you just talking shit you can't prove in court like the rest of the Trump side??? You and your husband really sound like \"smart\" people lol what a piece of work, glad Trump is out soon lol so we don't have to deal with can't think for yourselves ppl like you guys who believe everything Trump and his ppl tell you. \n\nThe only crook who is going to pay for his crimes is Trump after this with the lawsuits that are going to come his way after all this and for making up baseless claims and filing fraudulent lawsuits to try and get his way like the con he is. HE STILL HAS NOT SHOWN his taxes btw in 4 years lol. What is he hiding there?? The truth will come out soon enough. Trump may be the first US criminal president to go down for Tax Fraud and Tax Evasion. Don the con and #DiaperDon are trending right now. His family are also crooks and did some shady shit that must be investigated as well. Republicans should also PAY for allowing trumps behavior to continue when they know damn well they would not accept it if it were the other way around. Bunch of hypocrites and enablers they are for allowing Trump to try and fraud and steal an election away from president elect Biden the candidate the PEOPLE voted for as the next president. Oh and btw TRUMP LOST!!!!BY ALOT!!!! actually 7 Million votes or so to be exact. THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS THIS ACTUALLY except the RIGHT, and Trump and his team of idiots. Cuz even some Republicans are coming around to see that Biden won by a landslide and that Trump is a failure and a LOSER who is about to be out soon. Good riddance half the country are fed up with him and his supporters. Btw Fun Fact: Trump is the only president in history to LOSE the popular vote TWICE!! lol. Hey at least he will be remembered for that not to mention being the most pathetic cry baby of an outgoing president ever in the history of the US. Nobody has ever seen a cry baby like this before that's for sure. Anyways I'm happy Mr. One Term Trump will soon be gone, YES the whole world is breathing a sigh of relief for that one.

And here's why : he's actually talking about a voter fraud control organization RIGHT AFTER THAT. \n\nThe voter fraud he identifies is the intimidation tactics he references, the ones being used by Trump.

Asking for recounts when EVEN after the recount it still shows Biden won in those states. That sounds like Fraud to me, not to mention there were even reports they were taking away mail ballot slots in some places so ya....I will stick with what I originally said Biden tried to prevent fraud from happening Trump is basically doing it out in the open or attempted to do it and ppl are still ignoring this fact and being blind to it. That is BIG TIME! Ppl need to wake up and realize this.

Sad thing is that Trump is trying to steal the election away from Biden when he won fair and square and trying to disenfranchise the votes of 80 million plus people who voted for Biden, like they don't matter. Trump has people and states playing along with his game confusing the American people even further just for his own gain talk about a selfish sad sac of a person. Sad thing is Trump would rather play golf than deal with the serious issues the country is facing like losing over 3000 people a day to Covid. Sad thing is Trump is a bully who separates kids from their families. Sad thing is Trump don't realize how much damage he causes with his lies, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. His base believes anything he says as fact. This is the REAL sad part. Sad part is Trump supporters like the proud boys are threatening the lives of Democrats and of those who voted for Biden. They think its a dictatorship and Trump was destined to win or something and like Biden had no right to win. Sad part is Trump don't even care about his supporters or RED STATES, he cares about ONLY himself and his crooked family and also ALL the cons he is pardoning under his watch before he leaves office. Sad part is instead of trying to unify and bring people together he wants to divide and put the red against blue even more so than they already are. Sad part is Trump disrespects and treats like garbage anyone who goes against his word or train of thought. Sad part is Trump always thinks he is right and like he can get away with anything just cuz he is president. Which he will surely find out CHANGES once you leave office and aren't so special anymore. He will pay for the things he has done and said, this I' am sure of. So are most Biden supporters and Democrats who think the way I do about good old orange Trump. \n\nSad part is ultimately instead of caring about making America Great again he is like the titanic bringing everyone down with his sinking ship trying to destroy and undermine as much things as possible from the process before he has to leave later on this month. He is a disgrace and the REAL sad thing here, not those who voted for peace, leadership, direction, unity, calmness, tranquility acceptance of EVERY American not just White Americans or republicans as evidence by Biden's picks for cabinet as opposed to Trump's you will see a contrast there already.  Sad reality was that Trump was a TV president for his base not for the entire country and ALL THE REST who didn't support him, he basically could have cared less for these people. The president is supposed to be for everyone WHETHER  you voted for him or not or whether you like or not TRUMP WAS NOT THIS.

Also talks about important information regarding Covid-19. However, unlike the other two I linked this website is not specifically for Democrats or for people who voted for Biden, anyone could have used it but mentioning it is helpful to people who needed assistance with voting and other inquiries and did not know where else to turn. This website right here.\r\nhttps://www.eac.gov/ \r\n\r\nAnyways THAT is what Biden was talking about in this video. People do not understand what context is and like I said were jumping to conclusions because they did not understand what message Biden was trying to get across to his base. Which again was to VOTE EARLY and that they DON'T have to worry about fraud and their vote NOT COUNTING if they call the number I listed and go to those websites to help them with everything. Anyways I can't really make it much more clear than that lol.\r\n\r\nMost of these people I bet you never even bothered to do some research of their own on what he was actually talking about LOL!!. They just took a sentence or some words of what he said and are now acting like LOOK!!! you see lol he just admitted it there has to be fraud going on, he just said it!! lol. I would say hold on a second breathe, take the time to do some research do your due diligence educate yourself on what really is going on and what he was conveying to his supporters. Take the Trump glasses off for a second is what I would say to all those people who are stating the opposite of what I'm saying here lol. It might make you see things a bit more clearly if anything, and allow you not to overreact without knowing all the details first. \n\nNext time do some research first before you talk instead of believing something blindly without checking the facts BEHIND what is being talked about stop being a MINDLESS brainwashed clone like the rest of the ppl who see Trump as god. Use your brain for things other than talking nonsense you have no knowledge of. Be smarter okay hope I helped ya smh lol. You people are sad. Trump lost get over it and HE LOST FAIR AND SQUARE.

Anyone can have a difference of opinion it don't matter who you are. You know why? Cuz no 2 people on this planet are exactly the same and we each have different experiences that shape the way we think and view the world. \n\nEven twins although they look the same probably aren't exactly the same in terms of how they think. I for one disagree with many of your talking points but it is what it is I'm not on here to try and change your mind. You think how you think and I will think how I think and that's fine by me. I disagree that MSM lies about everything. They may leave certain things out here and there and seem bias because they cover things the way they want to, however; that don't make them evil or dishonest or bad people as Trump would have you believe slandering the names of many of these AMERICANS as well who are part of the media. \n\nwith this I agree with you down below\n\"We are all Americans, wanting the same thing. Truth, Fairness & a fair wage. Stop the fighting\". Although with the way people are acting towards one another not respecting one another and the differences amongst us I doubt it will happen anytime soon. Trump has caused this hate and division to become worse and now you are seeing the consequences of his actions and words the last 4 years. Thank him for how things are now between ppl. \n\nHowever in reality, my beef is with Trump and the supporters of his that want to cause violence and harm to anyone who likes Biden, the democrats and sees things not in the way they do. THAT is who my beef is with really. People are allowed not to like or listen to Trump you know, but if you listened to these people you would think otherwise. My beef is with people who can't accept Biden won fairly and THE WILL OF THE VOTERS for Biden, my beef is with people who want to take the country by force ignoring and not caring about the other half of the country who voted blue. These people act as if only those who voted for and wanted Trump matter and like everyone else is an enemy. THIS IS WRONG in case you are not aware. Why should I be surprised though Trump treated everyone who wasn't for him or agreed with him like the enemy for 4 years disrespecting, bullying, making fun of, threatening, belittling, berating and firing anyone that was in his way like a dictator. So its no surprise to me that many of his supporters see no wrong in acting this way themselves. Everyone else outside of this group though sees the wrong in their actions and takes responsibility for their own words UNLIKE Trump or his \"ppl\" which is truly sad imo.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Matthew R", "channel": "UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSFak2hZnhdJgawUkDysUlzklKEtXoLiHtQw_As=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yesterday I saw where in Lancaster there was 108,539 mail in ballots requested and had 89,539 returned, BUT there was 142,584 counted!. And people are stupid enough to believe it is a fair and honest election. Both sides should want it to be fair. There should be three rules or laws for voting. 1. You must be a legal U.S. resident. 2. You must vote in person and have an ID to prove you are who you say you are. 3. NO MAIL IN VOTES, except for military persons serving outside the country. When I vote I have to show my DL and sign the ledger which is proper for voting. Veritas exposed on video the vote harvesting scheme in Michigan which also proves that the election should be tossed out. Every election there should be a separate name on the ballot for those that don't like the choice and that is NONE OF THE ABOVE. Not to mention that when he stated on tv that he held money back until the prosecutor that was investigating Burisma oil was fired, that violated a part of U.S. code 18 . Can't recall the fine part but that actually bars him from ever holding any kind of public office again. IANAL, but these things like this need to be enforced across the board for every damn politician out there.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Rock4life", "channel": "UCfNcnw8iseERAU8LkgvipBQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbOhrZbYrk2vlxslu9sY_7uQc1SArv1glbyQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

He probably has 2 or more times worse record, cause he was in office 2008-2016, and here we consider 3yrs of obama vs 4yrs of trump...\nSo much propaganda from the campaign with the biggest budget in USA history and the biggest media and hollywood support, ie propaganda...\nAnd as far as I've heard the man who said \"If you don't vote for me you aren't black!\" was actually involved in segregation, he certainly didn't do anything or enough during his 40 years in government to help them...

He believes in climate change and wants to help stop it. He actually seems like he wants to do something about the racism in this country and help every race and gender be successful. I have not seen or herd anything about trump wanting to do anything \"for the people\", I mean what the hell did he do when we were having riots because of police brutality? Nothing. Yeah he has brought down unemployment and helped the economy but the truth is that both of those were already really good because of Obama, so to be honest why can't we say Biden will do the same? At this point I just want a president that cares for the human race and not just \"America\" I'm tired of trump and his supporters saying make America great again when really it was already great before him.

I will admit I'm not American so I don't know what you all do over in your country but over here in Australia we don't really talk about commiting crimes and then talk about making sure that when you do the thing legally it counts. The main reason is probably that most people have common sense but again, not American so I wouldn't know.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Knog Knog", "channel": "UCLa--gUGll8fKnQyA0WRGxA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSLoIj9S8UrTs3iVqBt59R5L--MZw3YmoaGA4l2=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you think it is expensive to live in Irvine, Cali that is what you will get. Sweden does not have federal minimum wage. This and other deregulation aids locals on opening businesses.

We have incredibly corrupt government and that won‚Äôt stop because of a vote. We must remove them and re-instate the original constitution as it says, or we will be destroyed and enslaved.

Down below\n\nWhat he's talking about is right here: The hotline first. \nYou can even call their number 1-833-DEM-VOTE (1-833-336-8683)\n\nAlso this is the website he is directly telling his supporters to go to if they had any questions or issues regarding their vote or the voting process. \nhttps://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/\n \nAs well as this website below has also been referred to if people needed more assistance with getting their vote counted and information on HOW to actually vote. Also talks about important information regarding Covid-19. However, unlike the other two I linked this website is not specifically for Democrats or for people who voted for Biden, anyone could have used it but mentioning it is helpful to people who needed assistance with voting and other inquiries and did not know where else to turn. This website right here.\nhttps://www.eac.gov/ \n\nAnyways THAT is what Biden was talking about in this video, hope I answered your question. People do not understand what context is and like I said were jumping to conclusions because they did not understand what message Biden was trying to get across to his base. Which again was to VOTE EARLY and that they DON'T have to worry about fraud and their vote NOT COUNTING if they call the number I listed and go to those websites to help them with everything. Anyways I can't really make it much more clear than that lol. All I can say is context matters its important lol and understanding the WHOLE VIDEO FULLY, not just watching bits and looking for clips and pieces of sentences to help Trump anyway they can make his case when it isn't what these people think it is. \n\nMost of these people I bet you never even bothered to do some research of their own on what he was actually talking about LOL!!. They just took a sentence or some words of what he said and are now acting like LOOK!!! you see lol he just admitted it there has to be fraud going on, he just said it!! lol. I would say hold on a second breathe, take the time to do some research educate yourself on what really is going on and what he was conveying to his supporters. Take the Trump glasses off for a second is what I would say to all those people who are stating the opposite of what I'm saying here lol.

For example, we wouldn't be seeing cases higher than what they were when we barely knew anything about the virus.\n\nYou are acting like the entire world didn't go into a lockdown. Every country did the lockdown. The lockdown was beneficial. It just didn't work as well because people didn't follow basic instructions. Had people done what they were supposed to do, businesses and workplaces would have opened up earlier. You also can't keep the country open at the expense of other people's lives. You can always strengthen the economy. You can't bring people back from the dead. Keeping the country open when there is a harmful disease going around with no vaccine would have led to: more death, higher spread and a more forceful lockdown. \n\nIt's also really disgusting how you don't take it seriously.

If you had an illness and you were not going to die from the illness alone but then you got Covid and then died, Covid killed you. Why do you think scientists are saying that people with underlying health conditions are most at risk? I'm going to need some sources for the claims that your making especially for \" if you are living in the same home as someone with covid chances are you'll never get it.\"\nThe fact that you believe the virus is manufactured tells me I dealing with someone who doesn't use actual facts to support their claims but conspiracy theories. Do you also believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism or that the Earth is Flat? \nWhy on earth would business people create a fake crisis that would lead to them losing profits? Not to mention also have the power to somehow convince international scientists and countries to go along with a fake crisis that they wouldn't benefit from.\nPeople not following covid guidelines is a problem in general. It has nothing to do with political affiliation. There is nothing wrong with going out to eat or get a hair cut as long as safety guidelines are being followed. \nKeeping everything open during the height of a pandemic is a terrible idea especially with safety guidelines not being followed. That is the reason people say Trump handled things poorly because he wanted people to open up with no guidelines or open up when they were experiencing high cases.\nMedicine exists to bypass natural selection.  By your logic there is no point of medicine. Let's just let natural selection do its work, right? Let's just let people die all willy-nilly even though it's possible to prevent it. BTW if your child gets seriously ill are you just going to let them die and let natural selection do its work or are you going to do all you can to stop a preventable death like a sane person?

Thirdly, this may come as an assumption since I don't know you personally, but I'm assuming you're a republican who is worried about voter fraud taking place because the people have chosen Biden/Harris as their new president.

THE PEOPLE WANNA KNOW!] and 2) PLEASE do a video showcasing ALL THE PEOPLE (you can find-there surely are tons more) who have either been fired or 'resigned' under Trump and compare it to average normal folks. I get that people do a job that's high-stress and quit after a couple of years if they can't handle it, sure, but... come on, this guy has them in and out in a few MONTHS repeatedly for the same office... like anyone who has to be near him enough to either upset him with honesty or be upset BY him when assessing the situation honestly... they bail/are told 'resign or be fired' Apprentice style. Please give us an evaluation! I'm super curious how y'all will deliver such intriguing reports. \n\nMy original rambling on and on comment:\nKnow what I would really love to see? It's backwards as timelines go, but can OBAMA be in Biden's cabinet? Can he be the guy to restore our foreign relations? Why, you ask? BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORLD F'KN LOVES BARRACK OBAMA! Seriously, the whole world LOVES that man and no one can restore our international relations the way he can. Secretary of State, please? After all, you can be part of the cabinet-even in the line of succession-as someone who cannot technically succeed (Elaine Chao is one such example)... and Elizabeth Warren for Secretary of Education, pretty please while we're at it. Bloomberg is suited for the Treasury, and Bernie can do a myriad of jobs-energy, veteran's affairs (though some think him protesting Vietnam disqualifies him, I don't), Housing&Urban Dev., or maybe my fave, the Interior which is currently-eep!-held by an oil lobbyist, last thing you want for someone responsible for protecting federal lands! While usually a doctor would hold the post, Sanders could do Health and Human services and get REAL Medicare for all established under Biden as his final cherry on top of an amazing career-go figure ELI LILLY, where the current Sec of Health+HS was PRESIDENT before taking the position [guy before him, an actual doc not executive, \"resigned\" as have so many under Trump]... Oh, and the idea of a Secretary or Director of Climate (the President CAN create such a thing and SHOULD bc it and energy need their own separate departments even if they will at some point work together... you can toss that in, too. I believe the DEPUTY of the cabinet positions is ALSO typically President-chosen; otherwise there wouldn't be so many people who were the deputies 2017-x who are now the Secretary of _ 100% Republican, 97% vile, 3% decentish as far as we can decipher.\n\nRandom but of 23 cabinet positions, under Trump only THREE are women, all notoriously bad for most people, most=anyone not super wealthy AND \"Christian\" [=nothing like Christ but abusing the name to gain leverage with people who think that's the #1 qualifier, as if Trump SAYING he's suddenly a Christian now that it's convenient makes him one, him and Melania who doesn't 'give a fk about Christmas' and seems to have retaliated by making two rows of trees be covered in blood red [something]... (The 3 women in the current cabinet: 1) the Sec. of Transportation who happens to be Mitch McConman's wife [and happens to have, as Sec of Labor and now of Transportation, made a pathway for many of her husband's pet projects, 2) the \"end public education and use education to build God's kingdom\" demon from hell who is the current Sec. of Education-the only woman eligible to be President among them [Mitch's wifey is a natural-born citizen, conveniently], and 3) the also-brutal Director of the CIA who was the Deputy director and replaced Pompeo when he was promoted to Sec of State in 2018-note a man was promoted to that important office-Gina Haspel, who both parties have issues with since she participated in waterboarding and other forms of torture and destroyed tapes of said torture when running one of Bush's black sites; even Republicans have a problem with her, but violence-loving [\"like a TV drama!\"] Trump doesn't, sigh)... As a woman, I'm horrified that these are the people of my gender put in leadership positions! We need the Ayanna Presley kinds of experienced and understanding-in-depth (and in her case first person or very close to it) in positions like HUD Secretary. It's a wee bit early for AOC, Tlaib, etc. Gotta kick some @$$ and take some names of the GOP first, ideally kicking them not just out of position but into a prison for the crimes they've no doubt committed in many cases. Still, while indeed most in cabinet positions should be highly experienced, it wouldn't hurt to have some in their 40s&50s, not just retirement aged experienced ones (especially considering, yknow, succession AND ideally having some of these people serve 8, 12, or 16 years, even, in the cabinet then going for the Presidency. :)", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Lintukoko", "channel": "UCI2AuWzRlb2EfvkbImcTsgQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQTvUwIV-Mavc42ITgxDx3AynTYTSEyNd0OCg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": true}

{"cid": "UgxhVCQ5ITHa-EsZpE54AaABAg", "text": "I'm really glad you guys did this interview and I'm supportive of Biden. One of the biggest reasons is I've seen him change his mind and positions when presented with a strong alternative. That being said, I was disheartened by his comments about the industrial animal agriculture model. Just fixing the environmental harms of chicken, hog and dairy factories isn't enough. This factory approach to animal production has destroyed family farmers, ranchers and dairy producers. I've watched it happen. It has also destroyed our relationship with the animals we are producing for our food. We need to treat these animals with respect and honor instead of packing them into confinement facilities and treating them like a cog in a giant meat and milk production machine. \nMy family has farmed for over 100 years in South Dakota and while we have gotten bigger, the relationship we have with our animals and land is still a relationship of honor and respect. A few weeks ago, during harvest, a blind calf got out and wandered off. My brother and his family took over 4 hours out of a busy day to find this calf and make sure it was returned safely. They didn't make any money from those hours or advance the important work of the farm, but it was important the calf was found because we owed it to her to take care of her. She's now safely returned and lives with her seeing-eye Holstein, who  does a pretty good job of looking over her.\nOur agricultural policies need to advance a model of food production based upon family farmers, ranchers and dairy producers. People who will stop what they are doing and find the lost animal.\nThank you again.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Frank James", "channel": "UCoTABOB9j3GgMb1hSWF39Cw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTxONlBmvwjtZu5cTTIOckB4WSWzcUrUvuUBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Generally no, because politicians are not people that usually express truths or untruths, they express opinions. Now, occationally, politicians claim something that could be either true or untrue and in that case we can always do a fact check. So let's do a fact check here. Biden said \"we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of american politics.\" Ok, here it is: https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/. You can read about this organization on that page. You can also call them at the number presented on the website. What he said next was \"What the president (Donald Trump) is trying to do is discourage people from voting by impying that their vote won't be counted, it can't be counted, 'we're gonna challenge it', and all these things\". Ok, so what he's saying is that Trump is allegedly discouraging people from voting, and that's not very democratic, it's actually a serious threat to democracy. So, putting two and two together, I would assume that this voter fraud organization is an organization to protect voters from \"Voter purging. Voter fraud. Voter suppression.\" as stated on their website. I can see how some people see the word FRAUD and then jump to a conclusion that he's talking about him winning the election fraudulently, I can see this because I know that there are many people that are much less intelligent than myself, so it's really no surprise to me that people think this way.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Pontus √Örfelt", "channel": "UCiILdnlB2l-h0oCdejufYxQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKc4BBPrjSnfp4JUVwD37BqVJVzNArIuQnDyJ_c24=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That can't be classified as a \"system\" can it?. It would be enough to say, vote, whoever gets the most wins. I take his words for what they are, not what we think he meant. Overwhelm the system? If he has the power and capability to create the largest \"anti\" voter fraud organization, he would have no problem putting together a voter fraud. I don't know how a fraud would work, but if he's smart enough to defeat fraud, he's smart enough to create it. I imagine getting an overload of mail  votes, throwing Trump's out, keeping your own, something that couldn't be possible if everyone went in person (but what do I know, I'm not a master of how to do fraud). It's skeptical that he expects more people to vote for Trump in person, he could do the same encouragement, but he seems too dependent and desperate of mail votes.  history shows that it's even for democrats and Republicans how they vote. Arguing Trump encourages to go in person is an assumption that people are actually going to do it. While there's a good chance people will do what people do, take the convenient way. Why would it be harder to vote as a black person? What is the argument that it is harder for democrats to vote, than for Republicans? Are democrats crippled? Logic tells me that it would be easier to do fraud with mail, than actually showing up in person. I'm not saying I'm right, but i am saying it feels suspicious. To repeat myself, if he's smart enough to put together the largest anti fraud organization, he's smart enough to put together the largest fraud one. He knows the system, and it's naive to think fraud is an impossibility. Then you'd never question or see, if it ever did happen, because you blindly believe humans won't cheat, or that a system can't be beaten, if you're smart enough. I hope whoever the people has voted for, wins, and there's nothing wrong with challenging suspicion of fraud.

I understand what you're saying about the transition. I think even when there's the slightest of doubt when it comes to fraud, its worth looking into, that it's okay to have a critical mind, and to a certain extent, that it isn't too crazy to question it, but rather a healthy thing, so that actual fraud could be stopped. Having said that, it needs to be backed up by evidence. And luckily we have courts to decide. Once decided, he ought to help with a smooth transition as you say, and accept defeat. Had he been right about the fraud, it would be in everyone's best interest, including the democrats, that democracy isn't failing. The Republicans would be all over the democrats if it had been the other way around I'm sure as well.

Biden has a tall task to fix what Trump couldn't about the country in the middle of a pandemic and he is acting that way putting his need to win above the American ppl even though he did not win. To me that sounds like a spoiled baby than a president. No other president would act this way and the Republicans would not accept it if it were a president on the democratic side. But its okay cuz its Trump for him to be this way??? \n\nLike thats BS sorry. They let him get away with murder and this is just another example of that. I don't think Trump will accept defeat EVEN when it is fairly clear even now he DID NOT WIN lol. Well right now it looks like he is not right and he is pissing everyone off who are tired of him and his antics, all 77 million plus and others around the world watching how he is behaving. The only ones not annoyed or pissed about this are some Republicans, his base and Trump ppl of course everyone else can't wait to see him gone to be completely honest with you. Its fine to investigate the fraud claims but pretty soon here its gonna get old and the more time passes that he keeps acting like that when it shows Biden is the clear winner the more stupid he is going to look and the more angry ppl will get at him and his administration, just saying like ppl are tired of him literally. Also Trump lawsuits from his team are being thrown out in most courts of law across the country because they can't back it up with concrete evidence just baseless claims and conspiracy theories which are being debunked as quickly as they are being brought up. People who are not on Trump's side are fed up with his denial and his attitude and words that further put his base into delusions that he will be the next president instead of telling them okay I lost time to move on and heal the country and mend no he is making this about himself and that's not fair to Americans well the rest of them that did not vote for him. He keeps dragging it on and his base eats up for breakfast lunch and dinner. I bet you he won't even congrats Joe Biden on the win even after it shows he clearly won cuz he is not a decent person that way. He is a bully and very disrespectful part of the reason so many voted against him.

I just think when everything is cleared 100% up, then there can be no excuses, and he must step down, be a bigger man and help with the transition. I don't agree with how he's handled the corona virus. But i hope it won't turn out to be compromising the safety of the citizens, opening the borders. being called racist if you don't, while everyone kneels for Antifa.

The courts are already deciding by throwing out Trump lawsuits I think that speaks for itself there to the validity of these claims. \"had there been\" ya but no fraud has ACTUALLY been proven in a court of law enough to change the outcome of this election in which Biden is right now as we speak the president elect so there is a lot ifs and maybes going on and the other side is tired of it and this Trump dude they have had to deal with his antics for 4 years now its time for him to step aside and let Biden try and fix his mess that he left and that Biden and his team are inheriting. Problem is I don't think Trump is capable of being the bigger man and stepping up with the transition of the Biden team his ego and babyish sore loserness attitude won't allow that to happen. The coronavirus is the biggest concern right now everything else pales in comparison, many families have lost loved ones due to how Trump handled this and they will never forget it nor ever forgive him for that. \n\nEspecially with knowledge he knew way in advance how this would impact ppl but chose to ignore it months prior. Ya and for the record I trust Biden way more than I trust that idiot Trump and I think 77 million ppl plus would agree with me on that one, I'm glad Biden and Kamala will be our next president and VP a change was needed. Time for the Trump clown show at the white house to come to an end, the people are tired of seeing that quite frankly well the majority as the vote showed. Biden has to go in there and wipe down and disinfect everything considering Trump had the virus did not enforce wearing masks to anyone around him irresponsibly and with no regard for others had large gatherings with his rallys and briefings as well as NO social distancing what so ever, ya nuff said he needs to go and the sooner the better if you ask me. Can't wait for January 2021 and a fresh new start wipe the slate clean with a new leadership hopefully and I KNOW many other ppl feel the way I do about this situation considering the circumstances. Trump has shown little respect for Biden, so I don't know why ppl think that Trump is owed anything at this point, in the respect factor/benefit of the doubt.

That's okay we will deal with it cuz Trump is the biggest sore loser baby I have ever seen and his base are idiots for believing everything this liar says. Republicans are hypocrites as well because if a democratic president was acting this way they would be all over him, but because its Trump they got nothing to say.

This includes the media, the left and many democrats, put ppl against these ppl at an alarming rate.

My whole thing was how hostile Trump and his supporters were of anyone that opposed him that it was irked me the most out of anything to be honest its one thing not to agree but to verbally attack and assault ppl who don't like Trump is another level many on the right took and that is what I personally took offense to. There was no respect anymore for differences of opinion and a lot of that was brought on by Trump's divisive attitude and rhetoric.  \n\nNot to mention the right and republicans are now threatening to not accept and push back on all things Biden including his presidency so if you think that about the democrats the republicans are not any better just saying......but to each his own we are on opposite sides of the fence and that's fine with me. Biden will try to unite the country and mend and heal as he has stated with whoever is willing and wants peace, others who want violence and division like Trump cannot be helped and saved if they don't try they can keep attending Trump rallies but far far away from the White House imo.

Not surprised since he is part of the elite. Bad he has DONE A LOT BAD it would take a long time to describe everything. I will just give a general overview though as best I can, pretty much put Americans against each other with his language was racism towards any minority, incited violence against others insulted Asian American ppl Arab American ppl and Latino American ppl as criminals. Very divisive with his words. Put ppl against the media bullied ppl fired ppl separated children from their families. Degraded women disrespected anyone who was against him. Accepted money from foreign governments. Won't show his tax returns leading many to conclude he committed some sort of fraud. Was a president for only his supporters not the WHOLE country. Started fights with other countries and world leaders and allies like Canada. Made ppl hate each other and other countries hate the USA as well. Lied about MANY things, pretty much he is the worst president I can ever remember being a president for the US lol. He has done so much damage and created chaos in the country. There are more things that I can't remember off the top of my head, but the worst thing he has done imo is IGNORE the covid 19 virus in the States for months, he took it as a joke like it would go away on its own and said it was a poor ppl virus, he infected ppl around him and in the White House and his actions or lack of actions have led to the US having the most cases and deaths in the world. NOW!!! after all that he is impeding ANOTHER PERSON who beat him in an election from getting vital information which any other president would hand over, he is hurting democracy and being selfish claiming he won and its fraud when its not and just basically delaying everything for his own personal gain. THAT IS WHY HE IS BAD lol. So hopefully that answer makes it clear for you. Trump also had SUPER SPREADER rallies with NO MASKS or distancing not caring about that the virus is out there and infecting ppl he was and IS the worst leader in that role I have ever seen, he also insulted science and doctors who tried to help ppl with the virus by informing the ppl giving updates on how bad it is.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "Matthew R", "channel": "UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSFak2hZnhdJgawUkDysUlzklKEtXoLiHtQw_As=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also I have stated plenty of times why I dislike Trump its all in my comments you just have to go back and read it, look a little harder. Its pretty obvious why a lot of ppl don't like Trump I mean even a little kid can figure out he is a bully. I guess Trump Supporters have not got the memo yet. For the record I don't listen to media I do my research read up on my info to come up with my conclusions about Trump and the ppl that support him. Trump does hate everyone though who isn't on his side lol. What am I missing here lol?? He don't like ppl of color, he does not condemn the KKK for some odd reason lol, he does not like immigrants, he makes fun of ppl with disabilities, he don't respect women or minorities, he disrespects war veterans, talks bad about Mexicans, has done racist things towards black people in the past etc..... \n\nSeparates kids from their families who still can't REUNITE with their families. I mean the list goes on and on not sure what you are talking about lol. Only people Trump don't hate is his family of course, SOME Republicans, and his brainwashed base/the right wing media cuz they kiss his ass and worship him like he can do no wrong. Why would he hate those people, they are on his side lol??? Everyone else though, even some who worked under him mean nothing to him as he has shown on plenty of occasions. You can't disagree with him or he bullies you like he did with Joe Biden calling him Sleepy the whole campaign like that's not disrespectful in itself. \n\nThe only bullshit I see is what comes from Trump, his supporters and his dumbass lawyer Rudy. All a bunch of liars/cons claiming things they can't prove in courts just because they are in denial and a bunch of sore losers not to mention hypocrites as well.  Also, I never said Biden was a perfect candidate with a perfect past but if you are trying to compare him to Trump and all his words and HIS past lol its a no brainer Biden wins by a country mile probably even more so lol its not even close actually HOW MUCH better Biden will be as president for the WHOLE country than Trump was. Biden will actually know how to lead and direct a country through a crisis right now which Trump was unable to. Not to mention Biden will be for all Americans not just those who voted for him. Trump was not he put his people against the other side, that is not what a president does I'm sorry. \n\nTrump was for his base and those who kissed his ass, the other side which is basically half the country who don't support him he neglected and treated like shit for 4 years so I mean its about time and a relief that came to an end in my opinion. Quite frankly 80 million people plus were fed up  with Trump and collectively voted him out, essentially fired him which is ironic considering that is what he was used to doing to so many other people. Trump has created many more enemies in the 4 years he has been office, go figure.

All of which came up this year out of no where. The masks and quarantine are an experiment to see how long the people can be controlled for. I live in New York and governor Cuomo just put out a huge new mandate saying you can't have a get together in your own house of more then 10 people. Right before Christmas time kinda funny... This is bullshit. I'm not saying the chinese virus does not exist but I will say that masks including the n95 masks do nothing. They have no purpose... So therefore all of this shit is bullshit. Notice no spikes when people were protesting. Now all of a sudden in a state where everyone was complying now we need more control... Cuomo stated that the cases are coming from gatherings at people's houses, Restaurants, and gyms. Why don't you just put us all down while you are at it. I am so sick of this country and all the kids who think they are smart. This is so stupid. Further more with a plauge or epidemic you don't quarantine people who aren't sick. This is unprecedented.

Biden won the popular vote by more than 5 million LEGAL votes and the electoral college as well, Trump did not beat him in either therefore he lost. Either way time will tell who came out on top Biden has got my money and all signs point to that as of now if you are a realistic person who sees both sides and not just what Trump and his ppl are spewing.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Matthew R", "channel": "UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSFak2hZnhdJgawUkDysUlzklKEtXoLiHtQw_As=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyOQCWMGHDGasdDh-B4AaABAg", "text": "To all those that say that Biden wasn't \"your first choice\" he really should have been.  I can like or agree with \"person A\" more than \"person B\", but the real thing that matters is will \"person A\" or \"person B\" ultimately get more of the things i feel needs to be accomplished (whether benefitting myself, my community, country, or world as a whole) or on the road to being accomplished.  And the answer to that question has been Biden right from the start. \nAs and example, take healthcare. A full public \"single payer\" type system is much better (Bernie) than a combination \"public option\" (Biden).  But i realize that if Bernie was the presidential candidate it would be very likely he would not even get a chance to implement his plan, either because he would lose the election (trump base + centrist (soft) republicans (who are so scared of \"socialism\" and on this issue alone would abstain or reluctantly vote for trump) or if Bernie did win, it would be by such a small margin and the senate would have zero chance of being held by the democrats (and i mean zero!).  Ultimately, the result for Bernie would be no movement at all towards a  public \"single payer\" system and a huge number of people without adequate healthcare coverage. For Biden, not only would everyone be able to have adequate coverage (albeit not as good as it should or could be) but half the step to a full comprehensive plan would be achieved, the results would be real and visible to all the naysayers, and the next step will have that much more widespread support and be easier to achieve. \nThis same thing applies to much of Biden's platform.  Right now the whole discussion surrounds \"ifs\" on a large scale. After four years of a Biden presidency the country as a whole can then be at a point of discussing \"hows\" on a more macro level. In other words, people can see that the sky didn't fall, cold war \"commies\" aren't coming out of the woodwork, and gramma isn't getting raped twice a month.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Stu Pidas", "channel": "UCOkBHGAPrPBTA6Q9C22eSVg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRXfNwHln4wFeBQZ1gU7IaUTx31P82IDwA0LA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The oldest living former President, Jimmy Carter, put solar panels on the roof of the White House, and sounded the alarm that fossil fuels were a dead end.

I heartily applaud your conviction and focus on the dire place we're in 45 years later, but think there's a deeper message for GOP - Reagan's ludicrous economic travesty of trickle down folly should be underscored by his removal of those PV panels from the People's House - he was, himself, a fossil, but unlike the current impostor in Office, had passable credibility as a thespian, rather than an obvious (and oblivious,) huckster.

I agree it's weird to be at the top of the GOP agenda list. NASA gets 0.4% of fed budget. The current plan is to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024. That date was pushed up by Trump so it would occur during his second term. If the timeline is kept it'll keep current plans moving ahead, keep the pressure on contractors to get things done on time and on budget, etc. China is rapidly developing their plans and it'll be important to have some claim to resources on the Moon. Plus SLS needs somewhere to go (or be canceled which isn't happening). NASA keeps having to change plans when new administrations come in which ends up delaying or canceling programs and costing time and money.  Jim Bridenstine - who many were skeptical at his confirmation - has done a really good job and should be kept on. More focus on climate science and education should be added with additional funding.

The point is, and what the EU does is they pay farmers to not overwork their land, to ensure that first, that will help reduce soil erosion and secondly to reduce food waste and the carbon footprint. At this point, farmers are already subsidized but its currently to mass produce mostly high water usage/tillage crops (although GM crops do reduce the need for soil turnover and thus soil erosion). This isn't kickbacks, these are measure to ensure the land that is fro food production remains viable- rotating crops that was the 'old' traditional  system isn't economically feasible in a free market system anymore.  T\nThe other part he was referring to is that you put land aside for carbon capture. These are usually plants that can pull out CO2 from the atmosphere, use some of it, and store some within the soil. There may be better methods of carbon capture but if this is done on non-agricultural land (high acidic land with low quality soil), this might be possible. But the larger point of the whole interview is that he  illustrated he wants to find ways to reduce the US and global carbon production. \nI will finish with this, the fact that he said he wants to transition away from fossil fuels is HUGE, the political consequences of such a statement could be drastic. The media jumped on that like they were starving for anything controversial so they can appear to be neutral. In Canada, when our Prime Minister said pretty much the same thing, it was a huge controversy, and we are a more left leaning society than America. I don't think you realize the guts it took to come out and say that, and to acknowledge it.\n Granted he still wants to allow fracking which is absolutely awful, but hopefully he can be persuaded - and that's the point here.

This is the point at which they tell you what they think you want to hear. A debate gives you insight into their actual thought process, or lack thereof, and forces them to also counter the opposing narrative. It allows us to see how well they know their own bs and whether or not that BS can stand up to any scrutiny under an opposing narrative. This is all just pure BS. Just a guy telling you what you want to hear and voters have been falling for it from him for 47 years now. Other than the Crime Bill, what has he actually accomplished in 47 years in the actual position to make policies and laws to fix all of the issues he proposes that he can now fix as President. Hell, he even had two full years as VP with a veto proof congress where literally anything they wanted to get done could have been pushed through without the need for a single Republican vote. And what did they squander those entire two years on? Not fixing Social Security, not immigration reform, not protecting the DACA kids, not prison reform, not tax reform, not eliminating terrorism, etc. Instead, they focused on overhauling the entire health care system, kicking 20 million people off of insurance plans that they actually liked and almost collapsing 1/6 of the economy in the process.  What does Joe have to show for 47 years of policy making? Putting millions of black men into prison for sh*t he makes sure that his own son gets away with.

But the path we are taking to move away from fossil fuels is generating activity and outcomes that are more damaging that the initial problem; partly because we are implementing immature technology that is not as far down the development curve as it needs to be. When the cure is worse than the disease then you need to stop taking the medicine; particularly when the medicine does not even offer a cure in the long term, as in this instance. \n\nDo you appreciate the amount of damage done extracting and processing exotic metals for batteries and electric motors?; metals such as lithium and rare earths. The extraction is bad enough but the processing is immensely polluting. Refining rare earths involves cracking acids and in some instances 30 days of harsh acid refinement with many cycles. Please look it up and educate yourself.\n\nAnd then we have the fact that we could not possibly generate the electricity required using renewables and if we did the vast majority of the planets surface would have to be covered in wind turbines and solar panels; nuclear is the only feasible way to do it if you want to exclude fossil fuels. And each wind turbine and solar panel comes at a massive cost in terms of the materials required, the processing energy and the pollution/damage caused as a result. \n\nYou realise that only something like 5% of energy is delivered as electricity as we stand....95% of it is delivered as oil (cars, planes, lorries, buses etc) or gas (household/commercial heating, industrial energy etc). Hence the electricity grid only supports 5% of current energy usage....imagine what has to be done to support all the other uses of energy if they were all delivered as electricity and the amount of additional cabling required.                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nLike I said previously....this is either all political posturing or sheer naivety as it is not credible.

Have you ever read a climate paper and see the phrase \"scientists think\" or scientist believe\" or \"scientists agree\", which means they do not know and science means \"knowledge\".  How many times how their models failed? many  How many times have they been caught fudging?  many You have a faith I cannot begin to touch.  If the oceans warm because of the sun, then we get more cloud coverage due to condensation and when that increases overtime the climate goes through a cooling and therefore the water cools and less clouds form and the cycle repeats itself and that is what the actual evidence.\n--\nHow do you know how old the earth is?  You do not because the One who made has never revealed that to you.  Even the \"experts\" with those models and various dating methods cannot agree?   They date the rocks by rock layers and the rock layers by the rocks - circular.  Carbon14 dating they dated Mt St. Helens newly formed canyons between 10k-50k years and they formed in 1980.\n\nThe ice cores are another proven lie, but I won't get into that story now - talking to someone who listens to so-called experts as a consensus, another flag where you know they are lying to you. The solution to their fear-porn is to give them money and give up your liberty and they NEVER lead by example.   If your parents raised you in such a manner you would never trust them - see how ignorant you are?  But liberal and unregenerate people are lazy thinkers and blindly accept anything one says with a few letters behind it and yet others with the same letters will contradict and be silenced because it goes against the agenda.  I'll bet you believe Trump colluded with Russia and stole the 2016 election because the experts and Media told you so while the actual evidence is the DNC and Hillary Clinton using Fusion GPS all conspired to overthrow a duly elected President, which is treason.  That is factual, but facts do not matter to you because you believe you are a thinker when you refuse to think for yourself.\n\nI'll bet you believe there is a pandemic or that a mask can help you.  I'll bet you would not believe that 50% and greater of the \"COVID cases\" are from people who religiously wear their muzzles and practice social distancing.  Again do not let facts or common sense affect your great ability to think.\n\nWhy does Barack Obama and Al Gore buy expensive real estate properties Oceanside when they sell you knuckleheads on the idea that in 12 years the sea levels will rise?  Show me a country that does not utilize fossil fuels and I'll show you a country without liberty in the 3rd world.    \n\nYou just keep living in irrational fear, the prison of the mind.

Obviously, there‚Äôs an enormous amount of conspiracy theories, misinformation, and projection, that make it confusing for many, but your statement is so flipped from reality, it‚Äôs hard to even address.  It‚Äôs unfortunate.  I‚Äôm not being condescending.  I know many friends and family that have been conned.  As a therapist, I called out Trump in 2015 for his narcissistic, sociopathic behavior when there was an entire field of Republicans running.  Trump has a long history of lying, corruption,  brazen  manipulation and is absolutely criminal.  It‚Äôs kind of fascinating.  The level of projection is staggering.  If you understand that when he criticizes Biden or most anyone, he‚Äôs really revealing himself you get a better sense of what‚Äôs up.  The fact that he has a secret bank account in a China, owes over 400 million to who knows who, and hasn‚Äôt paid hardly any taxes in the US, should be concerning enough, not counting calling military veterans ‚Äúlosers‚Äù,  telling Bob Woodward on audio that he knew exactly how deadly COVID was prior to telling the American people it was a Democratic hoax,  and no big deal, and creating deliberate  division and chaos in the country (because it serves him and he doesn‚Äôt care about anyone else) while causing increased COVID cases in every county he‚Äôs held rallies recently, costing thousands of lives unnecessarily.  I am more progressive, so Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice, but the choice between the two is a no-brainer.  You can judge the character between the two men easily if you just watch and listen and detox from Q-anon, Fox, etc.  I‚Äôm not entirely sure how we ended up in alternate universes but I do know Trump has caused tremendous damage and Biden is capable of empathy which is a pretty critical trait.  If you have a con in power that has no conscience, it‚Äôs flat out dangerous.

It eliminated lifetime caps (which is a big deal because a lifetime cap of a $1M is not a lot of money if you are diagnosed with a lifetime ailment that requires expensive treatments). It allowed for covering young adults on their parents health insurance place up to the age of 27. The idea that Biden could singlehandedly effect change in 47 years of government is unfair. He was ONE Senator out of 100. A Senator that was in the minority most of the time as the Republicans have had the majority most of the time. The VP can only do but so much as what he does is dependent on the President's (Obama in his case) agenda regardless of what he personally may have wanted to do. What has Trump done? He has spent his entire first term overturning and undoing everything good that Obama did for no other reason than to be spiteful. Trump is trying to get the ACA struck down first with no real plan to replace it which will leave millions uninsured in the meantime. Trump is unfit for office. Biden isn't perfect, but NO human is perfect. There is no way anyone agrees with anyone 100% on everything, let alone millions of people agreeing on everything. The way I see it, America has been shot and is bleeding out. Our first priority as Americans as a doctor would is to STOP the bleeding. Biden to me is the clamp to stop the bleeding artery in order to stabilize the country and prepare for surgery to repair the damages done.

I hate the polished turd that's always brought out that it \"allowed millions of people access to healthcare for the first time in their lives.\" Health care and health insurance are not synonymous. It may be accurate to say that it allowed them access to health insurance, but no one was denied access to health care prior to Obamacare, so in that respect it had no effect. The same number of people have access to health care now as had access to health care pre-Obamacare. As for providing millions with access to health insurance who didn't have access before, either because of pre-existing conditions, employers who didn't offer health insurance, or because of costs, Obamacare didn't actually insure any more people. It merely traded one set of people to insure for another. it is estimated that approx. 20 million \"new\" people got access to health insurance through Obamacare but it is also estimated that approx. 20 million people lost their private health insurance we were all promised would not be affected. I liked my doctor and I liked my plan prior to Obamacare. I now have neither of them. What I do have is substandard insurance that I'm forced to buy for the privilege of never actually getting to see the same doctor twice and paying through the nose for virtually everything that my insurance plan covered fully prior to Obamacare.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Marc", "channel": "UCdQuzLhUekDGJwPulIGWL3Q", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTVWjsNqwF67UVrWFImaDjD_NPpiDvz8G6mEw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We are the ones who have to transform from Adam into Jesus. We are the ones who have to make our exodus from Egypt(lower nature) and Babylon (society) the 12 disciples are the 12 astrological signs and describe phases of awakening through the 12 signs- Judah being Scorpio, the kiss of death before the Sun (Jesus) does for 3 days to be reborn. They lie to us b/c they don‚Äôt want us to know that we have direct contact with God atall times, they have cut us off from our spiritual power and soul connection to God, ourselves, and eachother. It‚Äôs the only way to control us. B/c if we fully realized ‚ÄúI and the father are one‚Äù and that every time you help another being your helping Jesus, we would be too powerful. Jesus said all who follow him will do works like his and greater. This is where humanity is heading in the Age of Aquarius. The 7 seals of revelation are the 7 spiritual centers in man/chakras. The 4 horsemen correspond to the 4 elements/spiritual states in which man lives in and must grow into - physical being the one we are born into - (pale horse-death) the red horse is emotions(water) which must be transmuted into higher emotions of love, the black horse is logic/air, which man can‚Äôt survive on logic left brain thinking alone like we‚Äôve been trained to do in school. And finally the white horse is the spiritual man, reborn as Jesus. Everything corresponds to something within your own experience that you can interface with yourself!
