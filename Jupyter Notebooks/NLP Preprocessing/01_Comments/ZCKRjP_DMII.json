No reason to doubt any of this, but keep this in mind please: We cannot go on like this, with global emissions continuing to rise every year. Global elite who invest in fossil fuels want us to extract and use every last ounce we can put our hands on, but there's only so much that Life can take, and we are already way too close to the limit. Especially now, that the oceanic conveyor currents are slowing down -- that is a very bad sign. So all this nicey nicey as shown in this video won't mean anything if we continue on the path we're on right now. All these conservation efforts aren't going to be able to keep up with cascading collapses in ecosystems that are likely when things really start to accelerate, which could happen any time from now on. It's up to the world's people to rise up, show they care about this beautiful planet which is our home, and stop global elites and tyrants alike from controlling everything. We could have put an end to the rise of global warming 20 years ago, if truth be known. It's ridiculous that it continues.", "time": "4 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "Sys Banana", "channel": "UCy88UcvwL-cpVfqy32AmBkA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRrDvryws27q7PXv1gl6p5wXR9vSstIZSaOUcS=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxQJredseM55zt4F7l4AaABAg", "text": "After the Earth first formed, the temperatures were higher than they are now. Anaerobic life evolved and flourished in conditions with high methane and CO2 levels for hundreds of millions of years. Then Cyanobacteria came into being and consumed the CO2 while releasing oxygen, creating a great dying off of the anaerobics.  The CO2 levels got so low that the Earth became what scientists call Snowball Earth. Eventually, however, the CO2 and oxygen levels balanced out and new life forms evolved and flourished in the pre-Cambrian Period. After this, the great extinctions that occurred were when CO2 or SO2 levels soared due to extended periods of basaltic flows such as those that created the Siberian Traps (associated with the Great Dying) and the Deccan traps (that drove the dinosaurs towards extinction before the Chicxulub asteroid strike).\nMega Eruptions, Large Igneous Provinces and Extinctions:\nhttps://samslair.blogspot.com/2019/07/mega-eruptions-disrupt-climate-and.html?m=1", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Sam Lair", "channel": "UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHI0ofAQcclqyQYWFUekfrl6JC9l_6ODYX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In fact the main greenhouse gas water vapor cools the surface by several degrees as correct physics explains and studies of real world data confirm.  That single fact refutes the IPCC claim that water vapor does most of \"33 degrees\" of warming. Increasing water vapor does not increase the temperature gradient by raising the surface temperature: instead it reduces the gradient as is well known by meteorologists. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and is of significant benefit in agriculture for a starving world. Real pollution could be handled in other ways with existing technology, and the hundreds of billions spent on useless carbon dioxide studies could be allocated to pollution reduction, starting with many Asian countries.  It could also build and operate quite a few hospitals in developing countries.

{"cid": "Ugiy066ovEkycXgCoAEC", "text": "None of these are examples of Evolution.\n\nEvolution would be natural selection of random point mutations (GATC.) It hasn't been shown that mutations occurred and were the source of the described variations. This ignores that there is a certain amount of variation in all reproduction of offspring. Thank goodness or everyone would look the same. Variety is both nice and useful. If you have 3 children and they are slightly different in height, hair color, health and temperament does this mean specific point mutations occurred within that one generation to cause these variations? No, this is simply genetic variety within a kind. Everyone has tens of thousands of genes which when combined with the opposite sex produces a new unique set of genes. Some are expressed to varying degrees leading to variation in size, color, etc. Mendelian breeding or natural selection based on outside pressures can cause some gene combinations to predominate. No mutations required!\n\nAs to the examples in the video, here is a crude example. If some cruel dictator killed all the blond, red or brown haired people and only the black haired people remained and in future generations black haired people predominated did evolution occur? No! So too in all the examples above. If some pressure simply eliminated other already existing varieties so one predominates, that is not evolution. Similar if some descendants in the normal range of variation within a kind are naturally thicker shelled, faster or have a better immune system they may eventually predominate.\n\nIf you were designing something to exist on it's own, would you make it very rigid to particular conditions so that as soon as environment changed it would be wiped out, or would you wisely build in a certain amount of variation so that at least some of them could survive and reproduce no matter what? Why be surprised our Creator would build a certain amount of useful variation into his creation?\n\nRealize differences are mainly superficial. Among humans gene combinations from reproduction may result in a wonderful variety in size, color, hair, shape, etc but other necessary internal things such as how our blood, lungs, nerves, digestion, reproduction, cells, etc work quite similar for everyone, thank goodness. Our eyes might be different colors, but they work the same.\n\nThank you for your time, If you are open minded to examining evidence on both sides of this important issue read and consider the following:\n\nhttp://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/Was-Life-Created/\nhttp://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/The-Origin-of-Life-Five-Questions-Worth-Asking/", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "A Different Take", "channel": "UCm22XQCWdJBZptchiPK239g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ59j0CPGi3eyMA-9FbnEGUcMSPsodC_vQE95oO=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Give it a couple more decades as the technologies for alternate energy matures, getting both better and cheaper, while increasing demand and dwindling supply of fossil fuels increases the cost of those, and within a very short time span, no one in their right mind will be burning expensive fossil fuels when they could be using much cheaper solar and such.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Peter Cohen", "channel": "UCKEhxqcM57tWV83m_OAdYLg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSlHKhTZn6W8gVpVRmearTLTtlWGwRDuOkcw20a=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
