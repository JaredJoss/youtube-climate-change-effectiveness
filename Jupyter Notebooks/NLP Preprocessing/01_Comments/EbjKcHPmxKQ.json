The thing with climate change is that Earth is always changing and we're going to be greatly affected so we're preventing this change. We were so well adapted with what we already have that we can't be bothered to start all over again. This is also the reason why we are keeping our current wildlife away from extinction, it's because we're afraid of change. This also why when searching for life, we're only taking notice of planets that are similar to us since we can't imagine a world different from us. There are two things that we can do and one thing to do is be ready to adapt to change and evolve instead of sticking with the past and not learn. Though I think when we accept that things will change, we're also bound to be heavily affected, and might go extinct, and that's a good enough reason to prevent these changes from happening, which is why that would be our second option.

Regardless of human inputs, the climate is always shifting toward periods of glaciation or, more rarely, shifting toward hot-house conditions.  Neither of these states is viable for civilisation as we know it.  So we can either somehow extend the pristine Holocene-like conditions indefinitely with massive geoengineering, OR we can do everything we can to eliminate our footprint and become a civilisation that adapts to a world that will periodically see much of the northern hemisphere covered in really thick ice sheets.  Is artificially maintaining the Holocene even viable for the long-term thrivability of life on Earth?

This climate allowed for extensive farming and human-kind transitioned from hunter-gatherers to farmers, giving rise to civilization.\n\nEarth's natural carbon cycle is a complex system of biological, chemical and physical processes operating in balance, whereby CO2 is sequestered in plants during the spring and summer growing season through photosynthesis and 'naturally' recycled back into the atmosphere through respiration and decomposing plants in the fall and winter. \n\nThen about 150 years ago, a new factor emerged that is having a huge effect on average global temperature (AGT). That new factor is the addition of more CO2 into a carbon cycle that nature had kept in balance over hundreds of thousands of years.  This extra CO2 comes from humans burning fossil fuels.\n\nThe CO2 level has now reached 408 ppm and is rising at the rate of 100 ppm in 31 years instead of 20,000 to 50,000 years.\n\nAccording to the Geological Society, there is no known precedent in the history of the Earth for the rate at which we are now increasing the atmospheric level of CO2, from the burning fossil fuels. \n\nEarth's current level of CO2 at 408 ppm exceeds the atmospheric conditions of the Pliocene era (350 to 400 ppm of CO2), which ended about 2.6 million years ago. \n\nPliocene average global temperatures (AGT) were only about 2 to 3 C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures (13.2 C). \n\nThose temperatures drove an intense hydrological cycle with extreme evaporation and precipitation.  This led to extensive rain forests, lush Savannah's (now occupied by deserts), small ice caps (about two-thirds of the present) and the sea level was about 25 meters higher than at present.\n\nLife abounded during the Pliocene. But such conditions mean agriculture would not be possible. The tropical Pliocene had intense alternating downpours and heat waves.  \n\nThe regular river flow and temperate Mediterranean type climates we are accustomed to, which allow for extensive farming which gave rise to human civilization could not exist under those conditions.\n\nAfter reviewing the latest climate science reports the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) has reported with 'high confidence' that without cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the world risks 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems'.   \n\nSevere, Pervasive and Irreversible Impacts\n\nWhen it comes to global warming, \"effect\" follows \"cause\" by 40 years.  The climate changes we are currently experiencing come as a result of the CO2 levels as they were in 1975. \n\nWe are now vulnerable to a level of climate disruption that human civilization has simply never seen before. \n\nWe won't get a do-over on this.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Xander Bekkett", "channel": "UCncx4TE5aKcTaVe5qhwWS3A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLReWNbXOkIZ33mdPhahFw9GekI9lx6RJ15ofw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And let's not mention corals, they are extremely sensitive to temperature change and the pH value if the water, there's been massive coral bleaching due to increasing acidity and temperature in oceans, take a look at the Great Barrier Reef. \n\nFish pellets? In the US anyway, most cattle feed is composed of mainly soybeans and corn. Anyway the dying off of corals is the larger cause of oceanic wildlife going extinct as they are the biodiversity hotspots in the seas.\n\nPollution? The mining and extracting of fossil fuels alone is devastating, heard of oil spills? They destroy the surrounding environment and kill off almost all the flora and fauna living there, if humans don't intervene by rescuing and washing off the oil on all the animals they will die in a matter of days. O and burning of fossil fuels both by cars and factories is the number 1 source for causing air pollution in all the cities and industrial area in the world. The air pollution alone causes an estimated 6.5 million people to die prematurely because of respiratory diseases and disorders alone annually.\n \nClimate change caused by global warming ironically affects vulnerable developing countries that have much lesser carbon footprints than the industrious nations of Europe, North America and East Asia. These countries could face their weather patterns shifting into more radical patterns like more droughts and floods, especially those in Africa and South Asia, their crops rely hugely on the monsoons and people will face famine when there is inadequate water or their fields are flooded. Their mountain glaciers in South Asia that regulates the flow of water into their major rivers could also disappear as the global temperature rises, also affecting their water supply. \n\nThe increasing rate of sea ice melting in the Artic could flood tiny island nations that had nothing to do with causing global warming. \n\nYes yes I do agree that large scale unethical animal husbandry breeds diseases and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics also increases the risk of spawning superbugs.

The main danger for Earth and its inhabitants, although directly caused by properties of the atmosphere, is not in the atmosphere itself: it comes from the heat-generating planetary interior that is denied cooling. In the last 40 years, when the average climate temperature changed a small fraction of 1 degree C, the annual earthquake energy has increased several-fold. This is not a theory – this is an observable fact. Addressing the problem of Global Warming is far more urgent and leads to far greater dangers for habitability of Earth than it is implied by climate studies. Dangers include sudden changes to Earth axis of rotation with simultaneous tsunamis on all oceans, followed by instant and irreversible \"climate change\"", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Some people LOVE IT HOT", "channel": "UCNRxC0ZXrrxlJqI2v4zAnqA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTjv9zGzkJnS2GQB09VOO-KRU1MgwSBwzNmF8PcqQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

No, we're not destroying the earth itself, it wont be destroyed.... that's why the campaign is (maybe) ineffective.

Empiricist Observation through the ages mandates that whatever positions of science Popes adopt, it is best for us normals, to adopt the Galileo positions if there are any. In this instance there are.\nBy the way, please add the following warming inputs to your \"models\" before crying wolf about human inputs.\n1) The Sun. Seems to have been changing the temp. of Mars to the extent that the ice of Mars is melting to water, observed this year (2016) to be flowing. - Sorry no SUVs in Mars yet.\nVenus - a weird planetary change to it's atmospheric composition seems to be taking place that requires high temp changes for the reactions.\nJupiter - Changes in it's spectra making it glow and develop huge storms being tracked as I write to you.\nSaturn - Changes to spectra on the rings. Changes to it's perennial storm eye.\nOther planetary changes to each planet from Mercury to Pluto in the Solar system all of which require higher energy inputs. \nAs these can only be accounted for by a higher energy output from the Sun, it is logical that the Earth will also experience changes from the higher Sun output, unless you maintain that our planet is extraordinary and does not form part of this Solar system.\n2) To whit, the Magnetic Poles have become highly peripatetic and moving far from their traditional positions. This means that the internal magma below the crust is moving.  A Thesis if that is true would be, extraordinary volcanic and earthquake activity on the surface. From Yellowstone to all around the Pacific Rim (Circle of Fire) there are continuous such reports in the last two years. Ergo we have a problem under our feet and not due to SUVs.\nObservation: Summers and Autumns are becoming longer? The Inuits report the Sun does not rise and fall at the same place as traditionally. That means that the angle of the True North/South rotational axis of Earth may also have changed inclination in relation to the plane of Earth's elliptic around the Sun resulting in a higher surface exposure to the Sun, thus beginning climate changes on the surface of the whole planet changing the lines of the Tropics etc. Nothing to do with SUVs again. Sorry.\nOne last one before I leave. There are reports that corrals of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia are dying. The \"warmists\" point at this as proof of planet warming. However it is well known that coral does very well in warmer waters (No die offs around higher latitudes) and dies off in cooler waters. In fact the opposite of the B/S  they're selling us. Now couple this to the fact that the South Magnetic Pole is slowly moving towards the Australian side of Antarctica and the question begins to beg \"is it just possible that the Great Barrier Reef current passing the Eastern Australian continent contains more cold water than was traditional?\" If true again sorry no SUVs to blame here but correlative inputs for huge climate changes in the offing are true. But sorry WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE. STOP FEELING GUILTY. \nBest figure out what changes may happen from all the above, and change your habitat in order to survive. Good luck.\nLast point, when debating and others are attacking your position, don't attack their person, it's like killing the messenger who brings bad news.

The article contained a list of most, if not all of the debunked climate change denial arguments from long ago found on other denier blogs.\n\nTowards the end the author admits: “It should be very easy for the reader to tell from this document that I have a very strong bias against the actions of government to adapt the planet to the ACC Hypothesis”.  \n\nHe says: “I'm frequently asked \"but what if you are wrong; isn't doing something better than doing nothing?\"  This is a fair question.  I've been wrong before.  I'll be wrong again”.  \n\nI found this answer to be rather cavalier.  There is a huge difference between playing roulette and playing “Russian” Roulette with a loaded gun, the stakes are much higher, which the author trivialises.\n\nI did find his article to be detailed and very well written.  What I didn't find was any links to actual scientific evidence to support his opinions.  \n\nWhile he sometimes refers to actual authentic scientific evidence, he then takes issue with the scientific conclusions of those published, peer reviewed articles and offers us nothing but his unscientific, unsupported opinion.  \n\nMost of his article contains discussion on engineering matters that have absolutely no relevance to climate science although he claims they do.  \n\nIt should be noted that he is not a climate scientist and has never submitted this article of his for publication in any scientific journal for peer review.  \n\nOne wonders why until you notice that the author of this article, David Simpson, is an Oil & Gas Engineering Consultant who among other things, can address issues in Coalbed Methane, Low Pressure Operations, Gas Measurement and Oil Field Construction.  \n\nHis company web-site states:  If you have a problem with collecting, moving, or storing hydrocarbon products MuleShoe Engineering can help.  \n\nHe makes his living from work in the oil industry.  Now I understand his admitted bias.

The problem we are currently facing is that fluctuations in global temperatures have become more erratic and devastating, which could also lead to dramatic weather patterns, all of which is happening at a much faster pace that normal. And coincidentally, this changes can be traced to about the same time our society began to produce large amounts of pollution and greenhouse gasses, of which we are just beginning to comprehend it affects. And to complicate this topic even more, scientists have detected changing solar temperatures which are contributing to Earth's changing climate and temperature.
