{"cid": "Ugzi4R-PWVJ2ixO0_ft4AaABAg", "text": "It would be interesting to know what happened in the Arctic during the 10,800 BCE abrupt climate change. We know there were two ice sheets - smaller Cordilleran and bigger Laurentide on North America. The Laurentide perhaps 3 - 4 km thick at some places. \r\n\r\nThere was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.\r\n\r\nAdjusted quote: \"Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.\"\r\n\r\nIf interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ∼9% of world terrestrial biomass on ∼10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km² in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps CO2 released by burning of ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. \r\n\r\nThere is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?\r\n\r\nOne simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. \r\n\r\nRecent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. \r\n\r\nThe paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w\r\n\r\nImpact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. \r\n\r\nThere are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // \r\n\r\nIt is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible \"string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker–Levy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000 m in diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. An encounter with such a million-km-wide debris cluster would be thousands of times more probable than a collision with a 100-km-wide comet or a 10-km asteroid.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "George Davidson", "channel": "UCtyV7Beit_SWdT2KNr1vfyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx4xXk1jpkfSZ8o717Z5OWTte0w6J1Mh0riw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That's a rhetorical question, as you obviously have, but have you seen a graph of deaths vs. cases? If so, you'd have seen that the peak in deaths comes slightly after the peak in cases. Why is that? It's because you don't instantly die the second you get Coronavirus, it's a relatively long process. However, that relative longevity is no match for actual longevity, and it ACTUALLY takes a longer time for CO2 to be broken down in the atmosphere. Look, if you aren't convinced, don't bother replying, it'll just waste your time.

What happens in the environment because of this is a preview of the good that can be done if people take the time to improve their interactions and connections with the environment. But what happens next is crucial. We have to follow up on the good done, and hopefully some of the habits people may have been made to pick up in these trying times can continue in a fashion that keeps the ball rolling.\n\nHowever, I have a proposition: I suggest that shutdowns like this could be experimented with in differing capacities and times with the intent to be routine. So imagine any sort of partial shutdown for, say, one week straight once every month or two months, maybe three months, with considerations put into who stays open and who shuts down for said week. Or even if it was just one week straight in the year that we, by federal decree, shut down for the week as we have. Even putting aside the environmental good, it’d give a lot of people time to physically and mentally recharge themselves, perhaps lead to a newfound state of improvement in the average person. I can imagine many of you might have been overwhelmed at times with your responsibilities in whatever you may have done before you were sent home while the virus cools down. Does any of this sound fair? Perhaps with a constructive conversation we can work out the kinks.\nBesides, such routine shutdowns could disrupt and lessen the severity of any number of diseases besides Coronavirus, and it’d be good practice for the time something else, potentially more dangerous or contagious, makes it’s debut.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "But First He Lit it on Fire", "channel": "UCLpt3h1AJrG71CXV-2AQcFQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSq8r5HeF4JXVP9-GE7vq6GXusH3QLjKfscxMmevQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It doesn't mean cutting all jobs from the energy sector and killing profits. What it does mean is investing in is renewable energy sources that can provide an alternative to fossil fuels that will 1) reduce the effects of global warming, 2) be easier to produce, and  3) SAVE money in the long term.

The pandemic will obviously have an impact on pollution, but it will make zero difference to climate change. Climate change is NOT anthropologically driven.\n\n\nWinter 2020, and the following 2021 will be colder. Noticeably. By more than a degree or two, NOT because of any decline in anthropogenic co2, but you can be sure these disingenuous hacksters will try to attribute the cooling global temperatures to less co2 during the covid pandemic. As if an atmospheric cycle so complex would have such an immediate and dramatic effect. (The only thing to have an immediate and direct effect on climate is the verticle column mediation, but the 'climate scientists' don't discuss that now.) \n\n\n\nWe will of course be expected to believe that two hundred years of producing CO2 takes 150 years to warm the planet by one degree,..... BUT.... in less than 6 months the global temperature can plummet by 2 or 3 degrees because of Covid.... And they WILL try to get you to believe that.\n\nAll the data homoganization they've been doing over the last ten years, to hide the lack of warming, they'll stop, and begin to show the effects of cooling, arctic ice mass increase, we have witnessed since 2014, which thus far they've denied. Which of course, will try to claim as proof their profoundly flawed theory is robust...\n\nRemember.... the establishment media have been wrong and lied about EVERYTHING for many a decade now.

If you're out of a job you're not even going to buy a new cheap ol' Chinese television no matter how cheap it is.  China may have to slow down it's output as demand has declined.\n\n\nThen there's the part where the rest of the world blames them for the outbreak itself.  We all know they covered up the seriousness of the virus as well as did nothing to prevent infected people from flying to all parts of the world until it was way too late.  Already Japan is looking to domestic manufacturing to replace Chinese products.  I think the US should do it as well.  Yes they will cost more but if they are of higher quality perhaps that will just mean we'll buy less of the item but reach the equivalent dollar value. I know, for example, that certain fishing reels made in California are the most popular in spite of cheap Chinese knock-offs, because they are able to service them and are definitely of high quality.

Solar output reduction correspondingly weakens the magnetosphere which it generates.\n2. A weakened magnetosphere allow more Solar and Cosmic radiation to enter.\n3. The increasing radiation warms our land, sea and air. As oceans warm dissolved greenhouse gases are released, a symptom not the driver of change.\nHard data shows temperature have always increased before CO2 rises in the past.\n4. Increasing radiation ionizes particles in our atmosphere, that grow in size, become dewdrops and then clouds.\nThis is why random flooding occurs. Cloud seeding that now feeds off higher evaporation from our water bodies.\n5. Japanese researchers studied eruptions from four volcanoes over a 306 year period.\n9 of the 11 eruptions occured duringbperiods of low output on our sun.\nThey postulated that UV within the increasing radiation was stimulating Muons within the silica rich lava, inciting heightened volcanic and earthquake activity.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Lawrence Smith", "channel": "UCwuG-juyCuPFjHdmwjBkvGA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQX_7u8_5sC5ID1PvsAxTevfQNJZyOdBDTeNA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
