{"cid": "UgwBXI-iDyccxN49GV14AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

It's apples and oranges we don't need to solve climate change OR poverty. We need to solve both. The IPCC report 2013, with IPCC being intergovernmental panel on climate change funded, formed by and used by 192 countries of the world found humans are undoubtedly causing global warming, the last years have been warmest on records leading to record levels of extreme events like hurricanes due to warmer oceans, mass killing of ocean ecosystems therefore fish populations therefore people who rely on fishing are now struggling for food. As many people as are brought up with other diseases in this video that was flakey even at the time are dieing of climate change related events. Entire low lieing areas of land will be gone in the next 50-100 years. Arctic animals are dieing or moving to human habitats they pose a danger to due to crap levels of arctic sea ice and ecosystem disruption ruining their food supply. The main common thing linking climate skeptics today is they just really don't know wtf they are talking about. Every statement is just the same few lines repeated with no evidence.

Such a focus would also be a factor in destroying or destabilizing the economies of India and China who are highly dependent on fossil fuels. But, yeah, who cares about a couple of billion Asians, right!\n\nHe also said that, dollar for dollar, tackling climate change as a project is the LAST thing we should do, because economically speaking - it's a bad project! Can you say reality check? What we can do about it is \"very little at a very high cost\" and that it would postpone warming by 6 years (which I find it curious since \"the golden child\" AOC believes the world's going to end at least 70 years before that).\n\nBravo to you for not putting things into context and ensuring the focus still remains on BAD PROJECTS that kill untold many.

He explicitly limits the analysis to impacts as of 2100; however, many of the distinct impacts predicted by climate change are beyond the 2100 time frame and not properly accounted for.\n(2) Economics is notoriously bad at properly estimating risks (a) over very long time frames, and (b) for low probability risks of high magnitude. Climate change has both features. Instead consult a mathematician or statistician for these situations.\n(3) Economics is also bad at determining cost/utility when zero/infinity is involved. The classic market failure is determining the cost for healthcare. If you will die without a certain treatment then it makes economic sense to spend everything you have for the treatment. Climate change has the unmistakable possibility of leading to existential crisis where human life on earth could go extinct. As we keep dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the probabilities go gradually from possibility to a certainty. If humans go extinct then all other returns on investment at that point are zero. ROI doesn't work here. Comparisons might be made with other existential crisis: nuclear war or large asteroids, but comparisons with Malaria incidence and such - it is comparing apples and oranges. The comparison with dangers posed by large asteroid is particularly apt because NASA actually has a program for spotting asteroids that potentially threaten the earth. In it there is no budget for actually stopping such an asteroid because at that point budgets don't matter and we would naturally throw everything we have at it. The dollar amount doesn't really matter as much as resources on hand at that point.\n(4) On longer time frames the increased incidence of malaria caused as a result of climate change dwarfs short-term prevention strategies analyzed in comparison. The ongoing cost of continued prevention measures gets higher and higher the longer your time-frame. The continued benefits of mitigated climate impacts have no ongoing costs but have ongoing marginal benefits. Thus, the longer your time-frame the better addressing climate change from an economic perspective becomes even when looking solely at the Malaria incidence example. Again, integrating the total impacts over multiple time-scales requires more complicated models than a fixed 2100 time-frame.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jay Hann", "channel": "UCL-MtI4E-q96rWHyIJghjuQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRwhgO6yLFD2W1XUQfN64CEfgJX2BjSozo3GnWY=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

[and shockingly it did get 5 likes]\n\nThe real critique of his talk:\n[I strongly disagree with the top10/bottom10 lists because they only take `good for humans` into account. If you ask me, one should also take `good for other sentient beings` into account. Considering that more than 50 Billion sentient animals are killed (most often after a very suffering-full life) for our culinary pleasures every year and it would be really easy to change that, the conclusion would probably be to take at least some of these interests into account.\nNow; setting this fundamental disagreement aside:]\n\nI basically agree with Mr. Lomborg, that we have to prioritize problems in a rational way, I don`t feel fit to criticize his top10/bottom10 list as I haven`t got the intellectual and time ressources to really examine these claims.\nI`m not quite happy how Mr. Lomborg simplifies some circumstances in this talk, he himself has written a book about the cheapest ways to do the most against global warming. So just because the kyoto-actions against global warming might be quite a waste of money (considering the alternative good that you could do) there might still be actions that were well spent.\nAlso he has some absurd optimistic notions about the future of the world, it doesn`t seem as likely (as he is proposing it to be) that in 100 years almost everyone in the world is rich. This stance seems to ignore some fundamental issues about the scarcity of ressources. The UN has projected, for example, that we`ll need 70% more food to feed the world in 50 years. This would either mean extreme costs [monetary and environmental] or extreme suffering.\n\nBasically I agree with the rationalisation Mr. Lomborg tries to achieve but not with the simplification.\nFor example; the Stern-Report says... that the cost to avert global warming would be enormous... but he also says, that mitigating global warming (and therefore averting a lot of cost of damage) would today still be affordable and have a really good cost-benefit-analysis.\n\nThe reality surely lies somewhere inbetween \"spending on global warming has the highest priority\" and \"global warming as a whole should not be spent any money upon\" [which is basically the stance Mr. Lomborg takes in this talk].\nConsidering that global warming will probably the biggest problem facing the earth [inducing famine, homelesness, health issues etc.] and considering that it isn`t really clear how much we can to to stop/mitigate global warming, it is quite dangerous to simply put it in a bottom10-prority-list.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Tulib", "channel": "UCn9aWMCZXX8ybISeGnKqjCg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS_cQD_2jcElbujz1VB96YjNFS_dCfvkAovWG4D8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
