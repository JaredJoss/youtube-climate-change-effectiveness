{"cid": "UgycAO-HzH40w8Salt14AaABAg", "text": "Both farmers and ranchers work extremely hard to put food on \"everyone's\" tables!  I was born a farmers daughter, and farming was what I was doing to make a living supporting two boys after my first, very unfaithful husband left!  I ended up re-marrying , and my current husband of 27 years, is a 4th generation rancher.  Because of my love of animals, I prefer ranching, but there are some moments when I miss certain aspects of farming.  \n\nThat being said, I saw the thumbnail for this video and only stopped to say very emphatically... \"There is NO SUCH THING\" as GLOBAL WARMING!!!!!   We have all been \"fed\" this by the globalists around the world. They know what is really going on, and what has been happening, and the major event that is about to happen which is causing all of this crazy weather, that is beginning to increase and will continue to do so... is a planet system that is re-entering our solar system... which will then pass back out on its elliptical orbit, to never return for another 3,600 years!!\n\nThese catastrophic events were recorded globally, in historical writings, around the time of the Biblical exodus, and was predicted in the Bible to come back at the end of days. Revelation in the Bible, calls this planet \"Wormwood\", and YES it is causing the planet to heat up because the gravitational pull on earths core and other planets in our solar system are effected by it! This by the way, was written about in newspapers and magazines since the 1940's and I have read several of them. But they stopped talking about it in the late 1970's because they didn't want the expendable people.... like us regular folks, to know what was about to happen.\n\nAsk yourself this:  Why on earth in 2017 was there a record amount of ice build-up in Antarctica?  The oceans are warming BENEATH the surface, not in our atmosphere \"caused by man\". And yes, ice sheets are melting due to this, but from under the surface where man cannot affect it!!!\n\nThe globalists (Cabal, Illuminati, deep state, elite) .... basically the Rockefellers, Bilderbergers, royal family in England, and those 13 families who have worked diligently behind the scenes for the past thousands of years, want YOU to believe that YOU caused the earth to heat up, so they could quietly steal your money to \"help global warming\".... using billions of tax dollars to build D.U.M.B.S. under the earths surface... so when this planet reaches its closest point to earth, THEY can live comfortably underground in huge, cities!\n\nTHEY know the coastlines of our continents will flood nearly 100 miles inland!!  Which is why the CIA headquarters was relocated to Denver, Colorado!  Why the Vatican closed up its VAST library and moved it to a \"safe\" location, and why so many major institutions have been moved to the central United States. Also ask yourself about these \"seed vaults\" which contain EVERY variety of seed a person could think of on earth, is being stored so carefully.  THEY... want to be able to go back to normal, after you and I \"John Q public\" are dead !  THEY want and are looking forward to a population reduction... check out the Georgia guide stones!!  --- Nobody knows who put them up, and talk about being politically incorrect and racist.... they announce in several languages that they want to reduce the earths population drastically!!\n\n\nHere is the good part!  The Bible which is 100% accurate, tells US that these underground cities that these globalists have built, will NOT save them from Gods wrath that will be poured out on the earth (Wormwood/Planet X/Nibiru/ Zena)-Whatever you want to call it, causes!  It describes a time when men will actually call out for the mountains to fall ON THEM, because they are in such terror!  \n\nThose who know Christ, and trust in Him, the Bible is very clear that they will be removed from the earth prior to this last 7 year period!

I'm a student of Agroecology in university so I can say with some property that organic farming as it was portrayed here does not at all changes how we produce and distribute food, it's only difference from conventional agriculture is that it ceases to use chemicals. This is a problem, as is the very system of food production that it keeps that must be replaced in order for meaning change to happen. We need a much more deep and complex change. A system change. Organic farming is not that! It still has a high degree of machinery use (and so fossil fuel), water usage and outside input (for example the manure he talks about in the video, where is this coming from? Organic agriculture does not adress that) usage. It doesn't get better with hydroponics.\nSo no, this is NOT the future of farming, because if it is, funnily, it will not be on longer future. As those two kinds of farming portrayed do not address the reasons why we are in the situation of climate change in the first place and so it cannot sustain life in the planet on a long-term.\nSo we actually need a cultural and spiritual change, a fundamental change in the way humanity understands itself and see its place in this world and our interactions with it.

They can be way more than 25% of the solution.\n\nStop adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere and poisoning groundwater/streams/oceans with nitrate runoff by using anaerobic digesters to turn animal and crop wastes into methane to offset natural gas/propane;\n\nUse the wastes from the digesters to grow algae for biodiesel to offset petrodiesel;\n\nFind the gene in Asparagopsis taxiformis (a tropical seaweed) that makes bromoform--adding just 2% of Asparagopsis  to cattle's diet might reduce their output of methane by 99%!--insert that gene into the algae we will grow for biodiesel, and after you've pressed the oils out, feed the remnant carbs/protein/vitamins/minerals to the ruminants, reduce their methane burps, and they will grow 15% faster on the same feed;\n\nPyrolyze all of the waste woody biomass we can come up with, to make wood vinegar (good for plants, bad for bad bugs and some weeds), pyrolysis oils for fuel, and char. Incorporate the char into the soil to store water and nutrients for crops, and its carbon stays sequestered for millennia (Google Terra Preta); \n\nAnd where soils need sweetening, use crushed silicate rock (basalt) instead of limestone (enhanced weathering). Lime adds carbon to the atmosphere. Silicates suck it out. And if you chose the right rock to crush, you can add all kinds of plant nutrients at the same time.\n\nBoth of these last two measures can hugely improve soil and its productivity while sequestering (worldwide) gigatons of carbon. Farmers/foresters have been strip mining the soil. Caring for it as above will restore it, and can triple production of depleted soils just as Earth goes from three times too many mouths to feed, to four, then five....\n\nAnd farmers/foresters can save the world (or help huge) while improving their soils, crops, and bottom lines.

Humans are very efficient at recycling amino acids; we're constantly overdosing on animal protein, which we're discovering is linked to our leading chronic killers like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.\n\nBesides, the other myth, the healthy aura around the word \"all-natural\" -- how do you convince that lot that meat grown in a lab is natural?

Since the late 1980s we developed what we call a multi-router/re-router and it's purpose is to connect with your American or global internet, overseas, through an inoccent American family's PC computer TO BE USED AS A CONDUIT and we can use it to connect with anyone and if someone tries to back track us, they will hit a BRICK WALL which is the inoccent American PC family's computer. So even if I tell you the truth of where I am YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THE TRUTHS THAT I WILL TELL YOU. You see I was trained to do just that since I retired from government service as an analyst intelligence officer for the other side. Let me say I was born and race in a land of near perpetual ice and snow with a very short summer and autuum window. I have experienced a lot of SHTF emergency situations so your problems are quiet very easy to solved for our scientists has already solved them in the 1950s,1960s, 1970s,1980s, and 1990s. And what we have been doing since then is constructing them and expanding them, making further improvements on them. Our greatest advantage is that WE ARE NOT COMPUTER ONLINE DEPENDENT but printed books dependent and non-stop usage industrial strenght archival microfilm dependent. And everything I do with a computer is recorded non-stop by an ASOM (auto-saved on microfilm) system and ASOP (auto-saved on print system simultaneously. Even my eyeglasses has a hardwired and wire connected monitor-recorder connected to an ASOM and ASOP system. All video-audio recordings are recorded on an archival industrial strenght non-stop usage non-stop and non-contact optical set up WORM type self-developing micro-frame film recording with the sounds recorded in the form of micro-grooves similar in principle to your phonographic vinyl records. ONCE RECORDED IS PERFECTLY AND PERMANENTLY RECORDED. My own computer is a hodgepodge of old, intermediate, and new technologies BUT THE MAIN AIM IS THAT THEY ALL WORK PERFECTLY WELL. It is part PC/workstation/server/archival worm tape and hard drive multi-redundancy storage system/ASOM and ASOM systems combined together. We still use the floppy disc and diskette and magnetic cassette tape memory storage system and the recording set up is multi-redundant with a hardwired SCT (SCAN-COPY-TRANSFER) O/S system. And right now I am in my own private printed-book based library and microfilm library.
