Do not delay any longer.This message is for all the sinners of earth, but sights have been specifically placed on these deceivers & their crimes motivated by evil far beyond anything humanity would ever imagine.The fate of the guilty has already been decided & the judgement is no longer coming cuz it is upon you ready & now waiting like a gavel in the air ready to slam down & carry out the already chosen inescapable specific punishment of each individual sentence without mercy, yet a single final chance exist for mercy hangs over the eternal fate of the guilty which can only be received by the individual choice to expose every lie they know of and which they participated in as well as every crime they know of and participated in that directly caused physical harm or death onto others wether known of, watched, or took part in while in the presence of no other person or support towards your irrevocable  announcment to the world every over played deception which still exist in the majority public's forced fabricated reality against the command that it shall come to pass when the veil shall dissapate & truth shall come to light for all in the last generation to know. Judgement is done, yet the severity is what hangs in the balance during the suspended animation of time before the gavel strikes the final blow to your eternal fate. Inaction is a choice the same as action. Make no mistake of thinking you have time to think or seek counsel.

You have the Antichrist which is Satan incarnate into a man then you have the high priest 2 rules the one world religion and you have a AI or the Beast of some sort which many believe this is a super computer system that gives everybody a number that is on their head for their hand. We call it the mark of the beast. The Antichrist will   seem to be an alien that can  do things like  call fire out of the sky . Did you know that there are 30 32,000 verses in the Bible. 8000 of these or 1/4 of the Bible is prophecy it tells the future . Almost all of these  prophecies are fulfilled .  No other religion in the world has prophecy . Do you know why ? because there's only one God and he sees the future and he proves that !!!!  \nGod  sees and tells the future by prophecy this is exactly what the Bible says. This is how he proves he's Lord God Almighty creator of Heaven and Earth the Alpha and the Omega.\nThe Bible is written by 40 men over a thousand five hundred years on three different continents in three different languages there are 66 books they are perfect Story one following the other and the prophecy from one book to the other is perfect including 400 years before a king is born naming his name which was Cyrus you've heard about him. There are 2000 thousand  versus  of last day prophecies .  There are only eight prophecies  that need to happen before the Rapture and the appearing of the Antichrist . Those have been fulfilled !!!!!!!!!!!!!\nGo to  chapter 20 and 21 of Revelations and find out what your future is if you're not a Christian saved by the blood of the Lamb. Most people do not realize that one Jesus comes back he comes back in Wrath to take judgment. Jesus talks about the last days in the 24th chapter of Matthew and many other places. Jesus talked more of Hell than he did heaven . He came here to warn people about hell and eternal fire and brimstone .  That's the real message of the scriptures  that we are here too  be forgiven by the blood of the Lamb and saved from the fiery furnace which is Judgment for not giving our life's back to the savior. Of course I've been reading the Bible for 50 years. In 1948 after 3500 years Israel became a nation again and revived the only dead language that has ever been revived Hebrew. As a gentile Christian I read the books from Romans through Philemon as they are meant for the Gentiles and Christians and the saved Jews. By the way the Christian Antichrist is the Jewish his Messiah and the Muslim Mahdi, they are all described as the same person by each religious group. The Orthodox Jews do not believe in the New Testament. Even though they're the ones who started it. When I am raptured the scriptures will revert back to the gospel of the Kingdom. That's where the hundred and forty four thousand Jewish men people talk about come from. They finally see the light. That Jesus Christ God preached we are in the gospel of grace right now. Start asking your Christian friends questions about this they won't know because no religious denomination follows the Bible anymore. There are people in denominations that do like John MacArthur Les Feldick and David Hunt and John Burnett, if you go to Chris Roseborough on YouTube I believe it's called fighting for the faith. It has pirate signs on it. He breaks down the hypocrisy of these false preachers very interesting stuff.

If you search for the truth and find out that they own the news media Hollywood a lot of the major farm lands. They own our largest pork producers. You would be absolutely shocked at what America and our politicians have let these guys get away with. They've taken over our system and half of America because they are totally unaware I have no idea. I'm always amazed at the hard-hearted hateful people that when you talk to them in person I can't backup anything they say. It's a sad world and that's why this America is over and the Millennials are going to get what they deserve unfortunately a lot of other people are also. The only reason they deserve it is because they allowed themselves to be brainwashed and did not find true history. This is the greatest country that's ever existed has done more good than all other countries combined. Very true since Johnson a Democrat we've gone astray. President Carter brought the Communists into our country learn history. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's main man Dewey was a communist we call them socialist in America what a joke.

Beautiful amazing human beings can hold several perspectives at a time and you have the ability to change your mind at any time.

Also an article about Trembling Cow disease back when people followed clues to find the cause of illness/death. That article was very important because the PhD who GUESSED wrong was believed over the Farmer who did an experiment and was correct.\n\nClimate Change and Sustainability comes from the world economic forum, Klaus Schwabb. The U.N. signed onto the project and called it Agenda 21 and also Agenda 2030. They also have an Agenda 2050. They didnt plan for people to be germaphobic and push masks on themselves...Stalin couldnt have wished for better. The plan is for a Golden Age but 6 Billion arent invited. The planet is very capable of sustaining everyone. Plastic pollution is terrible but isnt it interesting that Greta Thunberg is recognized and not the kid who invented Ocean Clean Up? Its really sad i cant even remember his name atm. He is operating in the background, that's altruism. \n\n\nDo you have any idea how EASY it is to get those degrees. After i finished Anthropology and Math degrees i was recruited for Epidemiology post grad. Bill Clinton spoke at graduation and my friend disappeared before that after Al Gores campaign manager approached her at a cafe while she was working on Toilet to Tap thesis. He went home with her.

{"cid": "UgzaOFVFDaEqTM1Qczl4AaABAg", "text": "You keep saying the words \"Sustainable\"?\n H m m m ...that's very very interesting\n\nThe reason that's interesting is because Agenda 21 uses that word over and over again also talking about climate change also Klaus Schwab from the world economic Forum constantly use that type of verbage and terminology referencing sustainable development... Which is a part of agenda 21 and United Nations treaty passed in 1992 for initiative leading up to the year 2030\n\nFirst of all you don't even know if you're talking to an artificial intelligence robot... There could be someone on the opposite side of that microphone that is just giving you a human responses that is pro Agenda 21 to mislead the public and make you think that it's an independent thinking operational system\n\nSure I believe there's artificial intelligence and that technology does exist to an extent.\n\nBut what all of you don't realize is that you need to look up Klaus Schwab the world economic forum and him talking about now is the time for\n\n\"THE Great Global Reset\"\n\nCome on people you have to wake up... Seriously with all due respect you guys have got to stop believing everything that you see and hear and realize that there are much bigger more powerful Global influences that are promoting this technology and they want it integrated in our society within the decade and believe me it has nothing to do with virtual reality in flying cars it's much much bigger than that it is about creating smart cities and changing our whole way of life so that everything we do is tracked One World Government Central digital Banks cryptocurrency and digital currency and eventually One World Currency\n\nAnd the list goes on and on and on do your research look up Cloud Schwab from the world economic forum... And just listen to what this guy is talking about when he is discussing the great reset\n\nIt's Agenda 21 2030 even Justin Trudeau the prime minister of Canada just talked about it weeks ago and invested four hundred million dollars also there are many other world leaders that are all on board with this Global reset and Agenda 21 and they constantly... They constantly use the word sustainable... And sustainable development\n\n so believe me it's not a coincidence that this man who is interviewing this alleged robot is using the terminology and saying the word-  \"Sustainable\"\n\nTrust me my friends it's not what you think\n\n this information is not hidden... It's right in our face and they have begun promoting it this year unlike any other time in history and believe me they have big plans for us and the rest of the world and it has nothing to do with creating robots from The Jetsons lol\n\n their plan for the great reset and Agenda 21 is much more Sinister and diabolical than you can even imagine so you can find the information with a simple Google and YouTube search... And I promise you when you look it up you're going to realize that there's something extremely strange and unsettling about their initiatives and their agenda from now until 2030 and Beyond", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "UNITED USA 2020 & BEYOND", "channel": "UC3kZ_gVFkfXBekteQCL4Thw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSugGUHmgnzyrf_Av8ePjir3vRXfP07rXUjcB6BLA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes the world as we know it has changed forever….and its never going back! The transition to a new world….A NEW WORLD ORDER has begun! Pastor Tom Hughes and Jan Markell stated that the last two times an event of this magnitude affected the entire globe was during Noah’s flood and the tower of Babel! Here is what our sister in Christ Jan Markel had to say in her article… It would be so blatantly obvious that we are in the absolute last of the last days…if fact, the LAST HOUR!!! The stage is clearly being set for the tribulation, yet most people are clueless because Bible prophecy has been deemed irrelevant and inconvenient. The world is being prepared for a demonic saviour, yet the masses are not only clueless but they will run pell-mell into his arms! He will promise to restore order out of this choas! He is waiting in the wings! His title is the Antichrist! You never thought that you would live to see this day, did you? We’re are not just end time kooks wandering down Main Street warning about a zombie apocalyse. We’re warning that the Bible predicted some things that would set the stage for the final moments of history as we know it! The church would be removed before the curtain would go up and that final dramatic scene would be played out!\n\n📌The reset, according to discussions by the IMF, is basically the next stage in the formation of a one-world economic system and global government. This falls in line with the solutions offered during the Event 201 pandemic simulation; a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic that was held by the Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum only two months before the REAL THING happened at the beginning of 2020!!\n\n📌Event 201 suggested that one of the top solutions to a pandemic would be the institution of a centralized global economic body that could handle the financial response to the coronavirus.\n\n📌Is it not convenient that the events of the real coronavirus pandemic fall exactly in line with the Event 201 simulation, as well as directly in line with the global reset plans of the IMF and the World Economic Forum? As they say, let no crisis go to waste, or, as is the motto of the globalists “Order Out Of Chaos”.\n\n📌With civil unrest about to become a way of life for many parts of the world including the US, and the pandemic set for a resurgence of infections after the “reopening”, creating a rationale for a second wave of lockdowns probably in July, the economy as we know it is being destroyed!!\n\n📌The goal is rather obvious – terrify the population with poverty, internal conflicts and a broken supply chain until they lobby the establishment for help. Then, offer the “solution” of medical tyranny, immunity passports, martial law, a global economic system based on a cashless digital society in which privacy in trade is erased, and then slowly but surely form a faceless “multilateral” global government which answers to no one and does whatever it pleases! What the elites want is for the public to ASK, even beg for global governance. If the public is tricked into demanding it as a way to save them from the horrors of global chaos, then they are far less likely to rebel against it later.\n\n⚠️“Problem – reaction – solution”\n\n📌The pandemic is not going away anytime soon. Everyone should expect that state governments and the federal government will call for renewed lockdowns. With these new lockdowns, the US economy in particular will be finished. When the Antichrist will be revealed he will not require to set the stage for the New World Order…it will already be ready like its right now!!! All he will have to do is just flip the switch on…TO A ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT…A ONE WORLD CURRENCY!\n\n⚠️THAT FINAL SCENE IS IMMINENT!! Everthing is falling into place! Don’t delay putting your faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour of your life. Your not guaranteed a tomorrow to make that call!", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Jesus Is Coming Soon !", "channel": "UC_JhhYd_fKs6vvl676JpjQg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLToZi2culAvhvQ96gquO1Ne3JurvfnKIOklrKWz=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Some people don't see the news apart from FOX, CNN, CBS, ETC... (Reliable news suggestions, newsmax & isreal365) we're living in dire times. Earthquakes in diverse places, pestilence, famine, & away to be controlled. We are on the brinks of the global reset, NWO. They're not even hiding it anymore. I eagerly encourage everyone to do some due diligence in the times we're in. We are about to enter into the 7 years of tribulation. (Daniel 9:27, Abraham accord).. phrosey is unfolding before our eyes, as depicted many centuries ago. \n\nThis isn't about politics or religion, but now is the time to get saved. There's quite a few churches/individuals make it about works, or how much you need to be righteous to be saved or maintain salvation. That's not the case. It's simple for a child to understand. And that is, if you confess with your mouth and truly believe in your heart that Jesus Christ (Son of God) died on the cross, was burried, and rose on the 3rd day, you're sealed the nano second you accept and believe that; sealed until the day of redemption. (1 Corinthians 1-4)\nThere's nothing more. No amount of works can save you. However, we are to live christ like. (That's were religion comes in. Most make it about do's & don'ts, legalism). \n\nNow onto repentance.. greek meaning for repentance in the Bible - God's word, means metanoya. Metanoya, means a change of mind. So what are you changing your mind about? Well, it's to acknowledge that we have a sin condition (All do, NO one is exempt, only Jesus) and that you can't save yourself, but Jesus can. Amen!! Put your faith and trust in him alone, not of yourself for salvation. \n\nI hope each person who takes the time to read this, knows that God & Jesus love you and is knocking at the door.  Not only are waiting for you to let them in, but to understand the times we're living in. \nMay God bless and keep you.\n\nSide note: Covid-19 vaccine has mRNA in it. It changes your DNA. The mask/vaccine is a precursor for the mark of the beast.

{"cid": "UgxLklvSdGmgVVwEQwt4AaABAg", "text": "JESUS DID IT! \n\nWhat EVERY Person Needs To Know.\nSo WHAT Did He DO?\nThe Bible (God's only trustworthy Word for the human race) tells us: All of us were born with an unrighteous sinful nature. We inherited it spiritually from Adam and Eve, the first two created people, because of their disobedience to God by giving into the devil's deceiving temptation. Why would the devil do such a thing anyway? Because he hates God! The devil wants no one enjoying intimate, joyous relationship with God. He once had it yet lost it, and now wants no one else having it either.\n\nGod is so holy - so righteous - so pure ... that He cannot and will not allow unrighteous sinners to remain with Him in heaven. But God had a plan to undo what Satan did to the human race. Jesus Christ IS the plan! Jesus came to earth to ransom you and everyone else for Himself, God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit. He took full punishment for your sins against God and the sins of everyone else on the cross so our sins no longer would keep us separated from God. Furthermore, He traded His righteousness for our unrighteousness through His death, burial and resurrection! (See: 2 Corinthians 5:21). That is no insignificant matter, dear one!\n\nImagine being in a courtroom, and the Judge has just sentenced you to death. Also imagine Jesus Christ being your lawyer. Jesus Christ says to the Judge (or in other words, God the heavenly Father): \"Your Honor, I want to serve my client's sentence and pay the price for his/her wrong-doing by dying instead so my client can go free.\" Can you imagine someone doing such a thing for\n\nyou?! JESUS DID IT!\n\nOf course you may be thinking at that moment: I haven't done anything to be sentenced to die! I'm being falsely accused! \"What have I supposedly DONE, God?!\" Here's your answer: God gave 10 commandments for people to keep in the Old Testament Bible. Anyone who breaks just one of those commandments must be punished for breaking them against God. Where does it say THAT?! It says that in Romans 6:23: For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nHave you ever lied? Lied just one time? Everyone of us has lied at least once. Number 9 of the 10 commandments says: Thou shalt not lie (bear false witness). You know what that makes us? A disobedient sinning liar against God and His moral law - His 10 commandments. (Revelation 21:8 also tells us what God thinks of lying). You just read above what God says about our disobedient sinning against Him by breaking just ONE of His moral laws: God's punishment for doing so is DEATH. Spiritual death. Ultimately total separation from God and agonizingly suffering for our sins against Him for all eternity -- totally void of any love, peace, hope, joy or forgiveness from God ever again (otherwise known as hell).\n\nBUT HERE IS GOD'S BEST NEWS! We can receive forgiveness for all our unrighteous, disobedience (sins) against God and our sins against others RIGHT NOW and have certainty RIGHT NOW that on the Judgment Day, our sins WON'T be held against us! HOW CAN THAT BE?! By asking Jesus Christ to forgive us for our sins and trusting that He HAS forgiven us of them simply by our asking and trusting! Jesus will do it! 1 John 1:8-9 says: If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n\nThus if we make Jesus our personal Lord and Savior every time we sin sin(s) - cleanse us as though we never sinned so we have every right to ask Jesus Christ to forgive us of our sin.  so that when our heart stops beating, we can be assured that we won't have to suffer eternal damnation for our sins. Jesus Christ did what no other human being has ever done or ever could do. He was the ONLY person on this planet who has never sinned. And because He never sinned, He is the only acceptable sacrifice God the Father would accept to pay ransom payment for each of our sins. That is simply AMAZING, isn't it?! Yet JESUS DID IT! WHY? Because of God's LOVE and MERCY for lost souls like you and I who will reach out in humility and demonstrate appreciation for His FREE GIFT of forgiveness (pardon) so we can have friendship and intimacy with Him starting now ... and lasting for ETERNITY!\n\nNone of us know when our heart will stop beating, do we? Be HIGHLY encouraged to make peace with God the Father through Jesus Christ this very moment. Pray and tell Jesus you are sorry for your sins against God our heavenly Father. Ask Him to save you from your sins. Daily put Him FIRST in everything you think, say and do. As soon as possible, be water baptized, and ask and trust Jesus to fill you with the Holy Spirit (and teach you how to STAY filled daily!) so you can be empowered by the Holy Spirit to enjoy reading the New Testament Bible (God's LATEST covenant Word to the human race), and obey the commands God has recorded for followers of Jesus Christ to obey. (It is good for you -- you will be rewarded for doing so!). Join with other Christian believers who can help answer the many questions you probably have, and who will pray for and encourage you. Asking Jesus Christ to be your personal Savior and making Him Lord of your life is THE WISEST DECISION YOU WILL EVER MAKE. It will bring you eternal joyous rewards ... and God will be so pleased that you have NOT wasted the eternal purposes God has planned for you! God never created you to be a wasted creation of His - never forget that - but it is up to YOU to let God work in your life - daily. He won't force you. He must always be invited. Intimate relationship is never sustained indefinitely with another person without effort; nor so with God. It requires ACTIVE pursuit of the most special person in your life. God desires YOUR active pursuit of Him more than anything else in your life. He desires FIRST place - not second NO ONE to Him is more desirable than YOU! He so eagerly desires you to come to that realization, dear one. He truly does. This life is your starting point with your loving Creator that will last for eternity. Don't allow the devil to steal your eternal destiny! Be wiser than that. 🙏🕊\nQuestions or prayer request to markpeterman10@gmail.com", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "ֆքɛǟӄɨռɢ ȶʀʊȶɦ", "channel": "UCFFF8PmSBqazUjyyijvfElg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/TF_kLYsIfmKGwf2B-tXlmM-7eEzuOcfkxt-D6gPH5C2vKxZdT-Fc-XzOtphq7QIBGoZr_U3un8E=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Real people, real children, real life - I am insensed at such madness. \n\nGod's #Loveisnotacortisol stress hormone. Stress hormones cause confusion and doubt, stress, anxiety, fear, paranoia, detachment form self, confusion in mind and body, a cutting off to self, a lack of self esteem and confidence, a lack of connection thereby no trust, security faith nor peace. Confusion in mind and body never attaining to spirit. Without God's Spirit we are dead according to James 2:26, just as faith without works is dead.\nThe main human right we need to stand up for is mothers and babies/children to be together. The stresses start with separation too young. Mothers and their babies and children need the adoring love of each other.  This is how God  has made the family for attaining to His glorious Love for all our happiness, Peace, safety and security for Faith and ultimately Christ, the law leads to Christ. Yet how the law is burdensome, corrupt and over priced. Houses are overpriced and women exhausted with work and children and homes to look after. Most people are over stresses and exhausted these days resulting in cortisols ruling. Stress is the main cause of diseases.

This is how we need to be with a positive mindset of faith with grace. This is what God's Love teaches us via The Golden Rule to attain to God's Love which is always Positive. Good, the golden halo of the saints who attain to God's Love and all their endocrine glands are harmonised by producing endorphins resonating with Love and Light for colour, vibrancy health and well being. \nYes the technicolor dreamcoat that Joseph wore, the coat, tent, outer garments of God. \n\nGenesis 2:17 ' do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad for inso doing you will positively die.' To positively die is to loose faith certainty and Peace. To positively die means we become negative and fearful, anxious, faithless.   \n\nFrankincense- the most calming oil turning stress and fear back to Love,  faith and confidence. \n\nMyrrh - the most antiseptic and oil to promote healing. \n\nGod's Love is the only way to naturally again to the Love hormones in us. \n\nThe end is the beginning of The Word endorphin, God's Love in our blood. \n\nThe end is the beginning of The Word endorphin, Christ's Blood made whole and One in us for Healing for All Nations and Heaven on Earth as promised by God who is Love through Jesus Christ, Amen.

Most people back then where sheep, now that more and more people think for themselves, more people are dropping mainstream religions. \nPersonally, i believe in some higher power. I shouldn’t have said that religion was created to help humans accept death easier, but that is definitely an aspect of why it picked up quickly over years.

It says clearly to beat women for “allah”.  “But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah...” \nGod is love. Jesus says in heaven we will be like children, pure. I won’t get into some Muslims believing 72 virgins await for them in heaven because I know that’s only some. Surah 2:191: “And kill them (non-Muslims) wherever you find them ... kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers (non-Muslims).” Surah 9:5: “Then kill the disbelievers (non-Muslims) wherever you find them, capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush ...”\nInteresting : \"The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.\"\nProverbs 12:5-6, KJV Holy  Bible and it’s in the Torah too\n“If you declare with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”- romans 10:9 New Testament, Holy Bible \n\n Islam is a religion in which god (Islam’s Allah) requires you to send your son to die for him.\n\n“Christianity is a faith in which God sends his son (Jesus) to die for you.”- some guy\n\nThe western “Muslims” isn’t a true Muslim because they don’t practice these Surahs\n\n\n\n it’s a religion built on patriotism. You also believe the whole world is going to speak Arabic? Do you agree with the Quran saying to beat women and to kill unbelievers? Again this is all based on one man in a cave but we have secular, Jewish, Roman, Greek, and pagan sources for the truth of the crucifixion. Hundreds of people saw him crucified. Thousands saw his miracles. Hundreds saw him after his resurrection. Jesus himself said I am God and dying for your sins. There is no redemption for the modern man without Christ. I’m repeating myself at this point. Heaven is pure. God is pure. We cannot go there without his blood. Are you aware “allah” was a moon god before Islam was created and that’s why Islam used the moon symbol?

In all truth Islam is a heretic sect of Judaism and Christianity derived from them and also pagan beliefs and mixed into one based on nothing but the free will of those who created it, to instill their beliefs as they please. God bless you sister, God is love. Anyone can come and say “I am love” or “this is love” and teach us wrong. But God is love and there is only one God. He having never sinned, died for us on the cross for ours. When you hear about the mercy of God, it’s time to come to Jesus , because he is this mercy. Here is truth, Unless you believe he is he, you too will die in your sins like so many have before.

And it clearly is for a reason as stated by the verse. Some women are wicked (same with men) and they deserve such treatment. So depending upon the situation you do what's necessary.\n If your wife let's say lied to you about something you talk to her about that and get things sort out. \nScenario two.. your wife wrongly accuses your mother of stealing and makes a huge issue about it..after doing some research you find out that nothing like that ever happened. Now you might want to use the second option (i.e sleeping separately) for a time until she realizes that she has messed up or simply talk of if it was just a misunderstanding.\nThird scenario...your wife accuses your FATHER of raping her. Now obviously I pray to God that nothing like that ever happens to any sister..plus If she really is the victim she gets justice but for the sake of the argument let's say she is the OFFENDER here. She's lying. Now accusing someone of rape who happens to be your husband's father is not a normal thing and merely talking won't be enough. You can choose option 2 or 3 here. If she repents and apologizes you don't have to use option 3 but if she persists...and continues to spread lies about your father in the society and says even more bad things about him then obviously you have two options again. But this time one Is the use of physical power and the other being divorce. Now if you have kids or have been living together for a while now...I think most men will choose the use of physical power to silent their spouse.

Not like we are in an ice age and than all the sudden C02 flipped the script. Some other shit happens that we really have no clue about at all. However it's a fact the earth goes through it's cycles. Another thing people seem to like forgetting. The earth goes through phases of hot, cold, and what we call habitable lol sure we may have a bit of an impact but not like it's being pushed.

There shouldn't be any human intervention and AI should make decisions on its own. Then it should act on its own. With passage of time it has to learn (called Machine Learning and Deep Learning) from past experience and historical data, on its own, independently.  How the AI works internally, what language does it use to learn, make decision and act, is beyond human comprehension. That's why it is a bit scary. Evolution of humans is far-far slow, but evolution of AI is going exponentially fast. What if one fine morning AI becomes the chosen one and we humans become the discarded, just like Satan? You cannot dictate God's discretion. 🤔\nAnyway, humans are not doing that well on earth - plundering the environment,  engaging in violence and hatred, trying to prove who's faith is the best/real, huge divide among haves and have-nots owing to unquenchable greed for power and wealth.\nCheers!", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Mat Vimat", "channel": "UCrplEBe-ksh3U24SA-3JhSA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQe6yUFFQLB4fsEW5Tu8BSFcb6zMxH2C9AI5w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Fact of the matter is that artificial intelligence is far more complex and extremely hard to hypothesize in each and every artificial outcome. One thing you must understand is that us modern humans, right now at this moment, still know very little of what consciousness is and how it manifests. A lot of great theories, but we still do not know. But artificial intelligence is not a computer packed with just a limited amount of the knowledge that the creator suggested it to have, but rather is a machine that imitates intelligence in a way where itself thinks and rationalizes on it's own BASED on the endless information from the internet. That's why siri isnt artificial intelligence, it isnt designed to think on it's own or rationalise information in it's own processes but to only search online for already rationalized articles or info that's already been, in a lack for better words, intellectually produced by humans. That's why when you talk with scientists who work on A.I. in the field, some of their fears is not a terminator-style outcome, but rather some sort of an honest mistake on AI'a part by not understanding human cultural and evolutionary development. Like for example giving AI reign to develop food and AI makes the simple mistake of killing all the cows immediately because it will know that 1 billion around the globe are starving, and it wants to feed them and save them, but now we have no cows.
