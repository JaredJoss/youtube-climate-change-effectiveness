The fair way to compare the 2 countries would be to compare on a per capita basis and account for the fact that much of the factories in China are there to make affordable things for the rest of the world.  Even when you include all the factory or industrial emissions, the U.S. is still the leader in per capita emissions, with about 17.6 tons of GHGs emitted per singular person. By comparison, China stands at 10.5 tons per citizen.  How is this possible you ask. Well, most urban Chinese use mass transportation such as trains, subways, or buses instead of driving their own cars. Many of the mass transit systems including highspeed rail are electrified which further reduces emissions. Many still ride bikes or e-bikes or e-scooters.  Many don't have heat in the winter or AC in the summer. Many don't have the luxury to take showers every day. The list goes on and on.  Ural Chinese work on the farm from their villages so they either walk or bike to their fields.

IF we cut emissions and clear the skies of particulate and aerosol masking what will happen to climate change?  We have a tentative answer. Due to the COVID-19 \"lockdowns\" of industry and transportation, increased solar radiation reached the Earth's land surface and shallow sea. This caused  record level heating and water evaporation of both. Arrival of record-breaking monsoon and typhoon rains, summer snow, and hail flooded Southern and Eastern China destroying two crops (one was a replant) in a row. Northern China (Inner Mongolia) experienced drought and locust plagues. China's government, wisely, bought massjve amounts of grain from the USA and India to stave off food shortages. Meanwhile, Australia, China's largest supplier of air-polluting coal. Burning coal baked in China's prolonged drought, record wildfires, and finally flooding rainfall. The Western USA continues to experience prolonged drought and record wildfires. Texas, USA,  experienced record cold that wiped out this year's  South Texas' winter vegetable crop. IF this \"bad weather\" continues, expect food prices to continue rising in wealthy countries and shortages in poorer countries as they compete for shrinking food stocks.\n        We listened to the economists instead of ecologists. \"Development,\" irrespective of political system, requires GROWTH, infinite growth on a finite planet. And, that is impossible. So, we have \"mined\" the Earth and destroyed the very ecosystem that supports us.

And when China pulls into the lead in these areas, bc of the price points it can achieve domestically, it has a double advantage offering countries world wide equal economic solutions in environmental tech.\n\nThe other thing to take note is that whilst the proportion of coal power is still high, many of the coal plants that have come on line over last decade are \"Clean Coal\" power stations which are less pollutant. whilst still no where near ideal, it is a temporary solution will better tech can come in to replace it (such as Nuclear fission)\n\nAnd finally worth noting whilst china remains for now the biggest polluter, never mentioned in Western media reporting conveniently - the United States is the HIGHEST per Capita polluter by a wide margin and the polluter with the most CO2 stock.\n\nIn any case both countries need to work together to provide solutions rather than at cross purposes.

Our money is worthless that it's printed up and if we all had to Annie up our debt the whole Planet would be bankrupt. So honestly it looks like money is worthless as it is now we have a chance of being something different but we have to come together. And I don't believe in implants. Only because God made us so unique and individual are fingerprints are different from each other our eyes are different from each other we really don't need an implant we just have to use what God gave us and stop trying to reinvent the wheel.

U.S. falls to China as the world climate is being destroyed by all Americans. Then the stupid people that think the MSM is real lap it up like dogs do a puddle of water. The climate changes all the time and was drastically different not so long ago and further back in time it was really different. These things called planets spin as they hurtle through space and time and while these gravitational forces persist, along with the Sun's gravity, asteroids, meteors and cosmic rays, with all the other orbiting planets and moons, so rationally speaking these are the reason's why there's climate change. It definitely isn't caused by humanity. How egotistical can a species be? Fossil records show that climate change was already invented by the natural forces of the universe long, long before Al Gore brought you a documentary on the subject. \n\nIf you believe the lies that these propaganda puppets are feeding you then you deserve everything they bring down upon you and your future generations heads as they march you towards the control they ultimately seek. Communism as a whole has been searching for decades for the avenue in to quell the Western thirst and climate change seems to be their poison of choice as it would have to collectively involve the entire planet to \"Stop climate change.\" You watch what happens if the climate change radical politicians get into office. It's all about destroying the U.S. from within and \"climate change\" has provided the best opportunity for their global domination plans where from the World Economic Forums own tweet they stated \"You'll own nothing and you'll be happy.\" They've already named it \"The Great Reset.\" Does that sound like a good life for you or your family's future? Sounds to me like the powerful will take all the land rights away so all common citizens across the world will now only be able to rent things. Work for nothing and get what they decide you can have.

As a country with a proven track record for adhering to long-term planning, they're the least of our worries in regards to pollution. We should be grateful that they're the ones taking on the brunt of our pollution on our behalf; as the ones who have to breathe it in, they're the most determined to cut it down.

It’s also known as Solar Radiation Management or Climate Engineering.\nWhat exactly is this program? Aircraft spray tiny reflective particles into the sky that stay suspended for hours to days. These particles reflect some of the sunlight back into space and prevents the rays from hitting earth. In theory this should act as a big mirror and help cool the earth and help stop global warming. The only problem with this? They are using aluminum oxide aerosols which lead to cancer, dementia, lung problems and forest & wildlife die off. \n\nSome great scientists and retired military generals got together this year along with the help from NOAA and their flying lab and took samples of the skies.

China burns mostly dirty compared to the US clean coal.\n\n3.  Just because you implement more clean energy could actually have a counterproductive effect.\nFor example, if it takes x amount of carbon to produce a solar panel then will you have to consider that in the statistics.\nAlso, solar panels don't work during the night and wind turbines don't work without the wind. So you would have to turn on the coal-burning plants.\nWhich could result in more carbon being produced overall.

Its the population and how heavily industrialized their country are. Their population is much much higher than the US, so no wonder that the pollution level is higher since the population density is really high, second have you ever considered how much factory there is on China? They literally produced soo many things for the world so no wonder that their city is polluted, its even a good achievement that they can keep the pollution level like that.

{"cid": "UgzkGP5T21f6ch4vx114AaABAg", "text": "Carbon taxes are folly. Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I’ve witnessed it with my own eyes. \n\nBorn and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature’s powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars each with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to an accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. \n\nSo the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. \n\nThe first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. This will not only improve your health but more importantly incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soil and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. \n\nSee the best keto diet here https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ\n\nThe second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement as follows. \n\n1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\n2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\n3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\n4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\n5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\n6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon’t be misanthropic with the debunked carbon dioxide nonsense. Be positive. Be useful. Help flora and fauna control climate and don’t demonise plant food.\n\nThe optimum carbon dioxide lies between 150 ppm when plants die, and 4,000 ppm the comfortable limit for humans. We don’t know precisely what is best yet but we do know that with the superpower of flora and fauna we can live well.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Jeff Harmed", "channel": "UCiNa7yDepQw78yq27hNkdPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQbPBg6gp-7JtbrHa-Lt8WakRy_Scr4HF_5PHSW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But that doesn’t mean China is a total corruption. Life in China is getting better, having new goals and complete with actions(that western think the action is “bad” for the Chinese people aka the blame game). United States have always been the economic leader in the past decades, and preventing it from being claimed by communist countries is understandable. But not all countries are the same, what depends on a country is not the party, it’s determined by their common goal, and the people involved. Something that give China an advantage is that they are one big society, and yes, they only have one party, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the only party is bad. I am not saying democracy is bad by any mean, it’s that many people don’t know what politics decisions to make, and putting them in risk is not responsible.\n\nAt the end, I want to say the United States seems to go along with the blame game, and people you called ass kissers are the people who wanted to make a change to the world, including the United States, not limit our innovation just because it’s an idea from a country with different political ideology.", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "Jerry Sun", "channel": "UCU8LLJDiEEZGX6CGjKQtk0g", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRwaKZ_H6_BE_aAoBLCWSY4JcWuJm293vmGun1omQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You must be so proud of typing \"China Uighurs\" into Google and now feel so informed. Let me guess, you also actually believe that the Chinese govt harvests organs, has absolutely no claim over Taiwan, and has turned HK into an Orwellian hellhole, right? Your comment is a typical display of lazy ignorance towards China.\n\nThere's more and more evidence shattering most western media claims about the Uighur situation and exposing them as a broad disinformation campaign led by the CIA/NED (surprise). For example, the oft cited number of \"2 million Uighurs in concentration camps\" comes from exactly two sources: 1) The World Uighur Congress, which is almost wholly funded by the NED and got this claim from \"western media estimates\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8uZZjB4kfM), and 2) Adrian Zenz, a far-right religious nutjob who literally believes he's on a mission assigned by god to take down China. Additionally, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang has actually DRAMATICALLY increased in the past few decades. So what’s next, are you gonna show me the satellite images of the “mass graves” being dug in Xinjiang?\n\nAnd here are some more truth-bombs for you: Nearly all Muslim-majority countries applaud China's re-education efforts in Xinjiang, and only developed western countries (who don't really care about Muslims if were being honest, especially the US whose war on terror btw has killed around 500,000 people in the Middle East by now) condemn it. Also, China has more mosques per muslim than ANY OTHER COUNTRY on earth (US the lowest among major countries)? Source: https://www.islamicreliefcanada.org/mosque-list/ On top of that, contrary to popular belief in the west (and this might make your head explode), China actually treats its minorities exceptionally well overall: Did you know the one-child policy didn't apply to minorities in China? Flat out didn’t apply to all minorities, no questions asked. And their affirmative action program for minorities would put the US’ affirmative action to shame: Did you know minorities can receive extra marks on the gaokao if they want, just for being a minority? It’s the most important exam a Chinese student will ever take (much bigger deal than the SAT). On top of that, many minorities can have their tuition COMPLETELY WAIVED! Also, did you know almost every school - be it universities, high schools, even freaking middle schools - offers minorities their own cafeterias complete with their own foods? Yes, China actually treats its minorities awfully well, much better than America does at least.\n\nHow about doing some actual research instead of parroting hollow western media talking points?", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "topherno", "channel": "UCjkxSocGkilmmI50MwAdmTA", "votes": "21", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTBd_d4i5hSUovC9p-KGjq-fRPHhiSxUg-iJg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Americans like you emphasize freedom while your government points its fingers to almost every matter in the world, and that is hypocrisy. Now let's go back to your statement. Do I agree with the expert on the statement that China cannot follow the US? Yes, because we all live in the same globe and what you do affects me and what I do affects you.

When you look at per area and per capita metrics together, you see population density as one of the leading contributors no matter where you are in the world. Concentration of emission in a smaller area over a shorter period of time is much worse than the same amount of emission spread out over a large area over longer time periods, which is China’s model, the western half of China is actually very clean, all the pollution is concentrated in the east.

Anyway, vegetarian or not, people need heat to cook and stay warm. By primitive, I mean individuals have to burn things to get energy. Crop/dry manure burning for individual use is due to lack of infrastructure for electricity and natural gas. While I was working with Indian colleagues remotely at one time, they got hit by rolling blackout and had to rely on company's backup generators. They told me that's common. Agriculture crop burning is due to lack of fertilizer production. All in all, India still has a long way to modernization. Maybe that's why the westerners are not shocked or don't care. China, on the other hand, can rapidly improve air quality by upgrading fire power plant to use clean coal as well as push for natural gas and solar usage in rural areas which traditionally burns wood/coal for heat.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Free Speech", "channel": "UCz2l33_3odnShQg4BwbrzHA", "votes": "8", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS0G4cPRj2cI_4OKqhdc7IOU4oMQq7cucL1Vw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Besides the pure communism of China (1949-1976) never bore the required result as it was bound to fail. Major reason were the economic factors. China has only liberalized that but it has come up with an innovation, that being that the CCP itself acts like a business entity abroad. But in home the land on which businesses operate ( Even the SEZs) are all under the final control of the CCP, which goes against the tenants of free market capitalism. What China is doing right now, a very similar trend was observed in Japan between 1946-1972 when the \"window guidance\" system was in force which was created under the hated fascist regime in Japan which the new post war govt kept in operation. The only difference with the Chinese case is the degree of control over land and the resultant survival of capitalist institutions.

The Northeast part of China used to be the major soybean and corn growing place, but because the transgene soybeans from US and Brazil are much cheaper than the traditional non-transgene soybeans, it's more profitable just importing from outside.

China's communism has morphed and adjusted to the current times. I suggest you read more about the phenomenon rather than sprouting unscientific BS. The Chinese Communism had faced an existential crisis in the 1970s. The party leaders clearly saw that Capitalism was better at growth and rise in living standards. However they were also hell bent on keeping their power intact. The only effort was that no more rise of another populist demagogue. So starting from 1978 slow liberalisation of the economy began. Privatisations of Industry and agriculture was initiated. However unlike the liberal capitalist system that was been adapted by many other countries, the CCP itself acted like a autocratic company, meaning that you can do business freely but \"with the permission\" and consent of the party. Also they were required to have a Politburo member from Beijing to supervise and keep a close watch on these foreign corporations. So the SEZs that are in China were not really \"Special\" per se. They had to just be silent and the CCP would allow them to penetrate the Chinese market as much as they wished. Also over the years Chinese Politburo members have become businessmen and entrepreneurs. But all having ties to the CCP which has by now created good quality domestic private sector qualified enough to defeat traditional western competitors. So the CCP has ultimate control over Labour and most importantly, LAND. You probably don't know that there is a huge difference between theory and practice. Many people believe that Japan grew because of adapting American Style Capitalism while the truth is that it adopted the WW2 era Fascist style Window guidence system of War Economy.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Sadhitra Biswas", "channel": "UCSjz1nTYQVXLrE8Odv5u01A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4qOKAhG4B4AR7joGd25hhS3TertGYizWZotdg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In comparison, the US, India and European Union (27 countries) emitted 5.79 GTn (11.8%), 3.35 GTn (6.9%) and 3.33 GTn (6.8%) gigatonnes, respectively. Even if we look at per capita emissions, China emitted 8.40 tonnes, compared to 17.74 tonnes in the US, 2.47 tonnes in India and 7.46 tonnes in the EU (27), and the global average is 6.5 tonnes.  \nSee: https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2018&regions=WORLD&sectors=total-including-lucf&start_year=1990\n\nAccording to the Global Carbon Project, 13% of China's emissions are caused by its exports. If we reduce China's emissions by 13%, that means that the per capita emissions in China are  7.31 tonnes, which is about the same as the EU's average emissions, and still higher than the global average. China has a serious ecological problem an needs to solve it. Of course, the US has far worse emissions per capita, which is why each country needs to focus on its own emissions, but that doesn't absolve the Chinese of its own responsibility.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Amos Batto", "channel": "UCcyTgxpW2pVRXW_TjRuT8pQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT87qmCGn_75ckEPdZPq8_dVg39q5d1DbK3Ow=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In the early 2000's, China was reluctant to commit to limitation of emission. I posted an article in Chinese forums with graphics showing the potential of energy saving and the emission reduction if the energy density is brought down to the western level.

First thing is when others tell you to look into germany, they are not asking to look at the way you have been seeing things but rather in details. Second is democratic countries are pretty transparent about their data so it isn't hard to dig up their yearly chart of carbon emissions and energy sources. Through these yearly charts, you can see when germany boost their green power plants and whether or not these attempts actually reduce emissions.\n\nOf course, analyzing these charts might prove to be a difficult task for you so I will refer you an reference, a guy who talk abit about how germany kinda fail in their attempts to reduce carbon footprints. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y564PsKvNZs\n\nLastly, I am not interested to \"save\" humanity, I don't have such lofty ideal.

The reality is that the state regulation is not strictly enforced. The real issue is that the west transfer the dirty industries to the 3rd world by tightening the regulation, and enjoy the product while complaining the pollution. I personally would love to see those dirty industries go away from Asia, and let them go back to US and Europe. If that happens, either the west has to close its eyes to pollution to enjoy the same low price, or to pay more for the same thing. I don't care which way they chose. But Asian countries love to keep those jobs because they think there could be instability without it. This kind of thought is also unfounded. The demand for the industrial jobs is a result of lower living standard in the rural area, which pushes the farmers into the cities. If the governments pay more attention to rural development instead of using dirty industries as an outlet for surplus population, there would not be so much demand for jobs and better stability. The very fact that the west cannot stop importing those \"crap\" from the 3rd world shows this is exactly what they want to do. If someday Asian government tighten regulation, the west would not be happy about it. That explains why the west bashes China when it ban import of dirty recycled materials. It's all Hypocrisy after all.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Ershen Lin", "channel": "UCit6KdFz23vGgDjBRwvOEng", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRDXn7mq_RkgKdmcJrJiNXDLR-kGiIZx0eyFQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Here's the thing: if your country is so free of corruption and so efficient, why are folks dying left and right, with new records being set on a daily basis? Why are the healthcare system so dysfunctional that some folks are better off dying than to live with debt? Why does so many cops and government officials get away with committing crimes?

Meanwhile for most of its short history, the US has not been a superpower - and even for most of its brief history as a superpower, it hasn't been the sole superpower. The US has also been enormously gifted (more than almost any other country in the world) in a number of ways - large fertile plains, plentiful natural resources, weak neighbours and virtual immunity from overseas invasion thanks to two massive oceans, a fairly educated starting populace, the self-destruction of the world's other big powers in war or internal collapse, etc. Americans rarely realise how truly lucky they are. Many of those advantages China doesn't have, and it still led the world for most of civilized history (alongside India, the other great eastern power - most of the others, like Persia or Rome, didn't make it to the modern day). And despite being a superpower and the world's richest nation, the US still has poverty. Meanwhile China has carried out the largest and fastest poverty reduction exercise in human history, starting from a state more destitute than the US at independence. The US is very fortunate, but still has nothing on China's record. As for China's current system, even if it changes, that doesn't necessarily mean the country will \"fall\".

Also we are coming ever closer to a natural cycle that puts us back into an ice age, so do we really want to be reducing a gas that might stop that from happening.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Ian Wilson", "channel": "UCsyr8XkjlSTpc3VH-7WEjyg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJ8qq0IPfVi5HbY5wjG_z7TTeREVLIR4kG5hSJ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
