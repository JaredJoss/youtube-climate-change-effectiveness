To a great extent, they also accept without question the completely outdated and definitively scientifically disproven paradigm of Newtonian Materialism. True Science is a methodology of truth discovery, and not a \"belief system\" as dictated by modern worldly institutions. Some of the foundational hallmarks of Government-grant-money-funded materialistic \"science\" include ignoring entire data sets, and fudging existing data to fit their own deeply entrenched worldview.

There is no reason to believe anything that the climate models forecast about future temperatures. The IPCC is hopelessly incompetent.\n\nThe world has been much warmer in the past than it is now. The Holocene Climate Optimum 8000 years ago was probably 4 degrees warmer than the present. The ecosphere throve during that time. \n\nAll the evidence we have is that warmer climates are milder climates. Not stormier. Warmer is also wetter. Fewer droughts. \n\nDuring the seven or so ice ages over the past million years, air temperature changes led CO2 changes by about 500 years every single time. \n\nGoing into an ice age, temperature went down. Hundreds of years later, CO2 went down. 100,000 years later (typically), when an ice age ended, first temperature rose. Then, some 500 years later, CO2 rose. Every single time.\n\nMr. Planck claimed the opposite is true. He is wrong; again not knowing what he's talking about.\n\nThere is no evidence -- zero -- that CO2 affected air temperature at any time all the way across 4 billion years of Geological history. \nSee for yourself: http://www.biocab.org/Carbon_Dioxide_Geological_Timescale.html\n\nAll you readers out there should go about your life in serene confidence about CO2 and the climate. There is no reason to think that CO2 emissions will do anything to the climate.\n\nThe climate is warming now, to our benefit. It's warmed before, it's cooled before, all without any CO2 influence. No one knows why the climate moves about as it does. But it does, and all by itself.\n\nIn fact, the only thing we know increasing CO2 has done, is to green up the entire global eco-sphere. Green growth has increased globally by 15% since 1980, all due to increasing CO2. Including the Amazon rain forest, and the Sahel in Africa.\n\nSee for yourself: \nhttps://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth\n\nDon't be scared. The whole global warming thing is a crock. Eat the meat you want (an evolutionary necessity in any case). \n\nTake joy in your family and friends, and have your babies in confidence of a better future, brought to you by the cheap and bountiful energy of fossil fuels.\n\nAnd one last comment, this one of a political nature. Mr. Planck talks about the greed of corporations. His solution is to make the government owner of everything, pretty much a super corporation. Ownership and greed centralized and with police and military power over all of you (us). Does anyone out there think that's a smart move?\n\nCrock upon crock.

{"cid": "UgwEu_Kq7L0EC4ON3PJ4AaABAg", "text": "Climate Change: Fear mongering by the globalist trying to take over the world.\n\nWhen life first began the CO2 level was 40,000 ppm (4%). After 4 billion years of mostly a linear decline down to 180 ppm (0.018%) the earth was in a stage one die off by the beginning of the industrial revolution.  Animals need 20% O2 to survive and anything under 0.018% CO2 is life depravation for plants. At 400 ppm the earth is experiencing a regreening. Also, the higher the CO2 content the more plants become drought resistant. Drought and famine are gone and the earth can now feed everyone. Today all green houses use CO2 generators to raise the CO2 content to lower water usage and increase crop yield. All life comes from the carbon formed by plants using CO2. All CO2 came from oil broken down at the surface by the first and oldest life, a bacteria that eats oil and gives off CO2. This bacteria was the planet terraformer that made all other life on the planet possible. The amount of oil on the surface sets the CO2 level just as the amount of water sets the O2 level. Every biosphere experiment ever tried failed because the amount of CO2 and O2 in the air has nothing to do with the life present on the surface, it is dependent on the water and oil on the surface.  Oil did not come from life, all life comes from oil. SEE; Fossel Fuel is a lie. Oil is geological squeeze from the center of the planet and did not come from dead life. SEE; Oil is Abiotic. All carbon life came from the oil the earth provides. The more we poke holes in the ground the higher the CO2 content. Releasing the oil allows more oil to form in its place and older once thought to be dry wells have all refilled. Currently it is known the the oil supply is endless and there is no longer a day looming in our future when we will run out. Typically CO2 content follows temperature change controlled by the amount of energy we receive from the sun. Temperature drives CO2, CO2 does not drive the temperature. The model to predict the energy we receive from the sun has been perfected enough that we can now predict climate change and follow the sun's effect on energy received and climate change. So far there is no effect on  the model predicted temperature and the temperatures we see. Will the oceans really swallow our costal cities and can we do any thing and should we do anything are questions only real science can answer. Except right now the only ones allowed to speak are the globalist using an abused child (Greta) and a failed mechanical engineer turned clown (Bill Nye) to lead their parade.\n\n “Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early 21st century's developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree, and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections combined into implausible chains of inference, proceeded to contemplate a roll-back of the industrial age.”\r\n-- Richard Lindzen\n\n\nWhat historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world - that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.\n-- Richard Lindzen", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "rmdlgarcia", "channel": "UC4a3ZQH391CQY_Nb1nuX_4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQb1ARNAVgU_eNm1489mhbDfHOKkFZAbakbobt7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Around 300 milllion years ago it was that low because life killing events happen. You will soon find that life on earth depends on CO2 levels above 200ppm. Just before the industrial revolution, we fell to 208ppm (0.02%), and the earth went into a stage one die-off. We are in a carbon drought. In Europe, it was first discovered, the tree line was falling as the CO2 got thinner. All CO2 comes from abiotic oil (no such thing as fossil fuel). In the beginning, the amount of oil reaching the surface set the CO2 level at 4,000ppm (4%). Whole herds of animals died in the pools of oil on the surface of the earth. The 4,000ppm was the high mark at over 450 million years ago when the earth was an overgrown jungle. Oil is a geological squeeze and as the earth gets older the amount of oil coming to the surface is less and less. Oil is transformed to plant giving life CO2 by the first bacteria that ate oil and gave off CO2. This bacteria existed long before plants and is still hard at work today. O2 comes from water vapor, H2O, in the upper atmosphere broken down to O2 and H2. Our atmosphere is oil and water and does not depend on animals or plants to maintain. The earth would have died in about 200 years to 2,000 years as first, the plants died then all animals. But then came the industrial revolution and CO2 levels have come back up to over 300ppm. We are now experiencing a regreening of the earth. More CO2 means more plants with more fruit and grain and worldwide hunger has disappeared. Man is now the most important part of the earth's ecosystem. If Man dies, the earth dies about 200 years later. This is why President Trump got us out of the Paris Accord and why the socialist say we only have ten years to save the planet. The socialist are liars and we need truth and real science, not politics to save the planet. You will find this all in the news before the next election. But you know everyone in the government knows all this. The Liberals just hope we don't find out before they can get back power. Truth: Carbon dioxide is the source of all life on this planet. Putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is good for all life on this planet. I bought a bigger SUV just to be part of the answer to saving the planet. \n(ABIOTIC OIL) https://principia-scientific.org/russians-nasa-discredit-fossil-fuel-theory-demise-of-junk-co2-science/\n(CARBON DROUGHT) https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/world-in-midst-of-carbon-drought/", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "rmdlgarcia", "channel": "UC4a3ZQH391CQY_Nb1nuX_4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQb1ARNAVgU_eNm1489mhbDfHOKkFZAbakbobt7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They lead the parade of socialist politicians asking for money and support for a big lie that has no science be hind it. The water will rise and fall no matter what we do. All we can do is follow the science. The world wide socialist control will end in ten years because we are moving from the age of information mixed with lies to the age of enlightenment. All thinking will conform to science and we will become better stewards of the earth. All lies will be called out and the socialist will lose all power. I follow the science and the word of credited voices. See: Richard Lindzen, he is your daddy. You have no commits based in science. The big rush to change everything is not because we will be dead in ten years. The push is because if the socialist don't get control soon they will lose power forever and world wide peace will follow. when the news is 100% the truth we will have nothing to argue about. Hitler was a socialist killing capitalist Jews for power. Hitler's socialist plan was war for a thousand years. Socialist trying to control the beer they didn't make to make us all safe got half the people shot. No biggie, truth is inevitable. Wake up on your own or wait for your red pill. It will come once we start bringing justice to the politicans and CEOs that have been lying to US. A world of hope enhanced by the brotherhood of man because there are no socialist to lie and start wars. Life will be good. All lies, hate, violence and crime come from the left (men who use other men for power and money). Socialism in the government leads to corruption. Socialism at the local level are co-ops. Police, fire dept. healthcare education at the local level are paid for by whatever means the people agree on. You don't like your co-op you can vote with your feet. Currently the goal of socialism is to have their one foot on your neck. Federal government by the Constitution was designed to have no control over our lives. It was designed to watch over our the local leaders and ensure our rights were observed. It was the federal government's job to protect our rights not regulate them. Currently if an elevator kills people no one is at fault if the OSCA stamp off is current regardless of actual inspections or payoffs. With the federal government no longer selling get out of jail free cards. We can sue the owner of the elevator in to bankruptcy to correct a wrong if need be. They will be replaced by other capitalist the will either do a better job or lose their shirt too. The federal government was designed to protect our rights, not tell us what our rights are.

The stripping of forests for plantations and habitats has changed the climate. \n\nThe planet’s climate has been controlled by life forms for 3 billion years as seen by earths carbon dioxide level of a mere 0.04% against our two neighbours mars and Venus that have 90%+ carbon dioxide. The burgeoning human population struggled to feed its own with grains that caused forests that bound soils and moisture to be ripped up and replaced with dry fields with no topsoil retention. So plant life’s grip on the climate was weakened and the climate shifted slightly. \n\nThe solution is to return the forests and feed the population at the same time. New plant factories in the Netherlands (53°N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.\n\nBuild plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\nUse cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\nUse goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\nUse agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\nUse marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\nUse minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon’t be misanthropic. Be positive. Be useful. Help flora and fauna control climate and don’t demonise plant food (carbon dioxide).\n\nIt’s now possible with plant factories to make a country like Britain self-sufficient in food and return its arable land to forests. It just requires the focus of resources.\n\nThe individual can also help reducing the rape of forests by moving away from grains into plant and animal fats and proteins with the keto diet and live longer and healthier lives.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Jeff Harmed", "channel": "UCiNa7yDepQw78yq27hNkdPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQbPBg6gp-7JtbrHa-Lt8WakRy_Scr4HF_5PHSW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "ballomni", "channel": "UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSu_PGYp6k79oSFOphOwlNS5Wi2I0lOCWhISZo=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Pinatubo erupted, all that Sulfur Dioxide cooled the Earth by 3C.  IT DID NOT WARM THE EARTH? \nIt DID keep in some warmth, but it kept out more, much more.  \nWhy?\nBecause it is the SUN that warms the Earth, and if you block out the Sun's heat, the earth gets cool, just like Clouds do because they are made of water molecules, which are powerful absorbers of IR radiation.\n\n\"also - clouds cool the earth by reflecting sunlight back, which is not a property of typical water vapor.\"\n\nHow exactly does a cloud  \"cool the earth by reflecting sunlight back\"?\nMind you I'm not surprised that you have no education in Quantum Physics most people don't>\nSo let me give you a short lesson.\n\n1.  There are three quantum states that may be changed by the absorption of a photon by an atom.\r \na. The State of Torsion and Rotation.  Microwaves change this state, and cause the atom to either bend or to rotate 180 degrees, as if its magnetic poles shifted.  This method of shifting teh magnetic pole of the atom is how magnetic induction plates create heat in metal pans.  It is also how an MRI works at the hospital.\n\r\n\r\nb. The Vibrational State.  Infrared photons change this state.  It causes the atom to vibrate faster\nc. The Energetic State.  Visible light photons change this state.  This causes an electron, in a low orbit around the nucleus of the atom to jump to a higher orbit matching the energy of the absorbed photon.  At the higher orbit, it then emits the photon out and falls back to its original orbit.  \n\n2.  It is the Electron in orbit around the nucleus, that absorbs the visible light photon, NOT THE MOLECULE NOR THE ATOM.  It makes NO difference whether the electron is part of a water molecule, or ice, or vapor.  The electron reacts to the Photon in the exact same way in all three states of matter.  \nIt absorbs the photon of visible light, jumps to a higher orbit matching the energy of the absorbed photon.  At the higher orbit, it then emits out the photon and falls back to the lower orbit.\n\n3.  Because the Law of Conservation of Momentum does NOT affect Quanta when the electron emits out the photon it absorbed, it has no original momentum.  Thus, the photon is emitted out in a totally random direction having no relationship to its original direction of travel.  Therefore, the electron acts like a little sun sending out photons of visible light in every direction.  Some go down some go up; some go back some go forward; some go to the right some go to the left.  \n\n4.  The more water molecules there are, the more electrons there are, so the more visible light photons will be absorbed.  Water molecules are packed together more tightly when in their liquid state than they are when in their vaporous state.  This means that the tiny water droplets that make up a cloud absorb more effectively than water vapor does because there are more electrons per cubic millimeter of space than there are when it is a vapor.\nBut the electron in the vaporous state absorbs and interacts with the visible light photon in the exact same way as when it is in its liquid state.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Bill Andrews", "channel": "UCcrROA3wjSQIyk1oLZC1FRQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSyCnXQMgipRiCFYz7PdTgb_CMKwi5e6jJtbQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzFyx7XcKV8T2DnznV4AaABAg", "text": "16. How Much Should Be The World's Population\n\nHow much population should the world have, that our earth can handle the pollution created by our work in which no harm comes to any living beings and the earth, it should be researched and that population has to be maintained.\n\nFor example if our earth can handle pollution of 1 billion people, then the world should have only 1 billion people only. We would have to have one child only from now on till the population reaches 1 billion. As if everybody had only one child, population will decrease. After that everyone can have 2 children's. When 2 children's are born, then population will increase. When the population reaches 1.5 billion, then everyone should have only one child till the population reaches back to 1 billion. After that everyone can have 2 children's. In this way population can be maintained. \n\nBut if the world doesn't want to keep the population limited, then this would lead to disasters. The world should not want that to happen. \n\nIn countries like india and china population is too much. In china people's are having 1 child only. In india the government has said to people to have 1 child only, but it is not followed. India has to agree to have one child only. Even if india agreed, still it would take a long time to reduce population for both countries. \nTo reduce population fast, this method should be used. \nCouples would be 1st born, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on. In this when a person is marrying another person, and they are 1st and 2nd born and also their father, mother and grandparents are 1st and 2nd born, then they can have 2 children's.\nIf the persons marrying each other are 1st and 2nd born, but the man's father or mother or grandfather or grandmother is 3rd born, 4th and so on, and the woman's father, mother and grandparents are 1st or 2nd born, then they can have 1 children. Also if the man is 3rd born, 4th and so on and his wife is 1st or 2nd born and wife's mother, father and grandparents are also 1st and 2nd born, then they can 1 children.\nIf the man is 3rd born or 4th and so on and also his wife is 3rd born or 4th and so on, then they should not have any children's.\nIf a man and woman are 1st or 2nd born, but both their father's, mother's or grandparents are 3rd born or 4th and so on, then they should not have any children's. In this way population can be reduced fast.\n\n17. We Can Reduce Eating Non Vegetarian Foods If Population Is Less\n\nIf population is less, then we can reduce eating non vegetarian foods as it is said that non vegetarian foods are causes of some problems in humans. \nIf some cold countries have less vegetarian foods, then they can import vegetarian foods from other countries who have more vegetarian foods.\nNon Vegetarian foods should be consumed only once a week. We must eat eggs once every week, take wednesday as the day. And on every sunday we should eat one non vegetarian food.\nOn one sunday eat chicken, next sunday eat goat, next sunday eat pig, next sunday eat fish and next sunday eat cow and stop eating meat of all other animals. \nIn india country people do not eat cow and only a few people eat pig, so india on one sunday should eat chicken, next sunday goat and next sunday fish. In pakistan pigs are not eaten, so pakistan on one sunday should eat chicken, next sunday eat goat, next sunday eat fish and next sunday eat cow.\nIf this is followed then the world won't need to do fishing much as because of too much fishing some big fishes like sharks and whales and penguins would get less fishes to eat. We should do fishing of small fishes only, not of big fishes such as sharks and whales.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgygFBh_5CnpHMryrqh4AaABAg", "text": "10. We Can Stop Eating Sweets, Cakes And Stop Drinking Liquor, Wine And Beer\n\nWe consume sweets and cakes. We make it from many things such as wheat, coconut, etc. and add sugar to it. But what we want is the sweet thing to consume which we are getting directly from fruits. The fruit is naturally sweet. So if we want to consume sweets and cakes, we do not have to prepare it, just we have to eat fruits. So all the sweet manufacturing companies can be shut down. If you shut down a sweet manufacturing company, then so many paper boxes need not be manufactured which are used to pack the sweets.\nLiquor, wine and beer are also made from fruits. So if you want to consume liquor, wine and beer, just eat fruits. If this is followed, then you do not have to set up liquor factories and prepare cartoon boxes for liquors. Send everybody to the rehabilitation centres those who can't live without liquor.\n\n11. To Stop Using Perfumes And Powders Which Is Not A Necessity\n\nWomen's could simply keep a flower in their hair instead of using perfumes and powders. For men, it can't be helped. For bad smell in body both men and women should exercise and sweat, it would reduce the bad smell.\nIf you stop using perfumes and powders, we don't need perfume and powder manufacturing companies. So many perfume and powder bottles need not be manufactured, cartoon boxes need not be manufactured for packing them and transportations can be reduced. All of this would result in less pollution.\n\n12. Could We Stop Drinking Cow's and Buffalo's Milk\n\nWhatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow's and buffalo's milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. \nFor infants whose mother's have died or mother's who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow's and buffalo's milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use lime with tea and coffee. A lime should be cut into a few pieces and cooked with tea and coffee or something else can be used instead of lime.\n\n13. A Manufacturing Company Which Is Not A Necessity For Human Beings, If It Is Stopped, Then We Have The Following Benefits\n\nWhen a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings, if it is stopped, then we have the following benefits.\nThat company which is built in a place, that much land is saved, machines does not have to be manufactured, for machines to operate oil is needed and many other things, for which we have to make oil manufacturing company and all other companies for all other things like cartoon boxes, plastic ropes and plastic cans, registers, pencil, pen, stationery products. To make cartoon boxes papers are required and to stick papers gums are required. To make gums so much dough is needed and caustic soda is needed. If we don't manufacture cartoon boxes then that dough can be eaten. Transportation is needed to deliver things to all the shops. Roads have to be constructed. For transportation we need vehicles and to operate vehicles petrol is needed, to get petrol we have to set up oil rig platforms in the sea or land and to deliver petrol to a petrol pump that petrol is needed to be put in a drum, a plastic drum has to be manufactured and then many ships have to be manufactured for shipping the petrol to all the places. For all this works so much land is lost and so much pollution is created, from that pollution humans, land animals, sea animals, aerial animals and earth is suffering. Also many transportation items which requires huge trucks for transportation a driver has to drive only at night and his day life is lost. Surely at night time driving the driver would become sleepy sometimes and accidents do happen. \nAll of this can be reduced and this will be our benefits if we stopped a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings. When you stop making a manufacturing company then all the problems related with it won't occur.\n\nDue to coronavirus pandemic it would be better if we don't open the companies which are not required as a necessity for humans. It would be help in preventing from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n14. Why We Should Manufacture Less Nutrient Foods Like Horlicks And Bournvita\n\nBournvita, Horlicks should be given to only persons who cannot exercise and are too weak. For others who have deficiency and are not too weak, they should eat natural foods and exercise so that the foods would get absorbed well in their body and their deficiency would be alright. If still they cannot exercise and get tired easily, they could do some light exercises or yoga in their spare time which would take long to get tired. If this is done, we won't have to prepare so many horlicks, bournvita and other nutrients foods like that. So then we don't have to prepare the plastic, glass or paper pack bottles and hence less pollution.\n\n15. To Reduce Television Time\n\nTelevision programs is for 24 hours a day. A human works for 8 hours a day, 1 hour for getting ready in the morning, travelling time assume for 2 hours a day, half an hour would be spent in relaxing, talking to friend's for half an hour, talking with family for half an hour, 1 hour spent in a park and sleeping time for 6 hours. Altogether 19 and half hours are spent for weekdays. So only 4 and half hours are left. In that why television is then for 24 hours. Well non working women's and students going to schools and colleges have extra free time. As television is for 24 hours now, then many students instead of spending their time in studying watch television more and study less. Non working women’s in their free time instead of watching television could do some other activities. Television should be shown in evening from 7pm to 8pm, cartoon shows should be shown for kids at that time. From 8pm to 9pm teenagers programs should be shown. From 9pm to 11pm programs should be shown for grown-up peoples. If you watch colour television for more than 2 hours, the rays coming from television affects your health and eyes.\n\nAt present due to problems going on in the world, 24 hours news channels are required. So we can keep news channels for 24 hours. Sports channels can also be shown for 24 hours. \n\nOn Sundays television can be shown for 9 to 11am in the morning and 2 to 5pm in the afternoon and 7 to 11pm in the evening.\n\nAlso in a year so many movies are made. In a year there are 52 weeks, so only 52 movies should be produced in one country. One Sunday one movie should be watched. Their should be no production of video or CD cassettes of the picture, only uploaded in the internet, so that if anyone wants to watch any movie again, they can download and watch it again. \n\nAlso if their are only 52 movies in a week, there would be less downloading of movies in the whole world due to which there would be less amount of internet radiation.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Hai să inundăm YouTube și pe clienții lor de publicitate cu constatările raportului nostru, să le înconjurăm sediile cu panouri publicitare informative și să menținem presiunea până când YouTube și toți giganții rețelelor sociale opresc distribuția minciunilor către milioane de oameni! \nSEMNEAZĂ ACUM\n\nDragi prieteni și prietene, \n\nAvaaz tocmai a scos la iveală un scandal imens: în timp ce lumea noastră e în flăcări, YouTube distribuie clipuri care neagă încălzirea globală către milioane de oameni!\n\nȘi asta nu e tot: mai face și bani din asta…\n\nTocmai am lansat raportul, iar YouTube simte presiune din partea mass-media. Însă știm că acești giganți din domeniul tehnologiei nu vor acționa urgent decât dacă brandul le e pus în pericol, iar principalii lor clienți de publicitate iau atitudine.\n\nAici intrăm noi în acțiune!\n\nHai să inundăm YouTube și pe clienții lor principali de publicitate cu constatările raportului nostru, apoi să mergem cu apelul la FIECARE rețea socială importantă, să le informăm angajații și autoritățile de reglementare și să menținem presiunea până când YouTube oprește distribuția minciunilor către milioane de oameni! \n\nAlătură-te acestui apel global. Semnează acum \n\nCând au căutat “global warming” (încălzire globală) și “climate change” (schimbări climatice), cercetătorii Avaaz au descoperit că algoritmul YouTube prezintă clipuri de dezinformare care au adunat milioane și milioane de vizualizări. Clipurile susțin că încălzirea globală e o „farsă”, că oamenii de știință greșesc și că învinuirea oamenilor pentru acest fenomen este o „înșelătorie”. \n\nNu e vorba doar despre YouTube. Majoritatea algoritmilor din rețelele sociale sunt programați pentru a maximiza timpul petrecut pe platforma respectivă, chiar dacă acest lucru implică milioane de oameni care urmăresc teorii ale conspirației fără sens și dezinformare crasă.\n\nThe Guardian, TIME și alte obiective media influente din întreaga lume au scris despre descoperirile noastre. Dacă ne oprim acum, impactul media ar putea să scadă și lucrurile s-ar putea întoarce la normal. Nu putem permite ca acest lucru să se întâmple.\n\nAșadar, hai să creăm un precedent, să demonstrăm companiei YouTube și altor giganți ai rețelelor sociale că milioane de oameni vor să acționeze de urgență în această privință. Hai să aducem de partea noastră atât clienții de publicitate, cât și pe angajații lor, pentru a-i determina să schimbe cursul. Semnează acum, apoi citește raportul nostru și trimite-l tuturor prietenilor tăi: \n\nAlătură-te acestui apel global. Semnează acum \n\nAceastă mișcare este formată din milioane de cetățeni care cred într-o lume mai bună și luptă pentru ea. Membrii Avaaz din fiecare colț al acestei planete ne-au finanțat investigația despre dezinformarea climatică și ne-au ajutat să creăm acest val uriaș în presă, precum și oportunitatea pentru schimbare. Am ajuns lideri de opinie în această apărare globală a adevărului pentru că, indiferent dacă e vorba despre schimbări climatice, sănătate publică sau viitorul democrației în sine, avem nevoie de fapte pentru a găsi soluțiile care ne salvează pe toți.\n\nCu respect și recunoștință,\n\nFlora, Alaphia, Christoph, Anneke, Muriel, Nataliya, Fadi și restul echipei Avaaz\n\nMai multe informații:\n\n(EN) De ce transmite YouTube clipuri de dezinformare în privința schimbărilor climatice către milioane de oameni? - raportul Avaaz : https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/youtube_climate_misinformation/", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Anca Ceraceanu", "channel": "UCeVgr0h80DD7hfZccZdqG1g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRJdgduI1TxnaUwYGSLEj-CuHN2LiCb8HoP7Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwpcRc0odtRjmy-p594AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Therefore, all politics should mainly focus to solve this issue, globally and cooperatively. The government could invest into research of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, fusion, but also developing electronic cars, making them less expensive and building more corresponding fueling stations. A complete exit out of coal and oil ought to be strived for. But the average civizen can also help: Vote a rational party with relevant priorities, Don't fly with plane, buy mainly local food, throw less leftovers away, heat less, shower/bath less, and don't eat meat or other animal products. These things are all unnecessary. Especially the whole animal industry, that contributes to most (51%) of the green house gases (methane is 20x more effective than CO2) and is directly responsible for 91% of cutting down forrests. A plant based diet is not just the best for the climate, but also the best for your health, in preventing and reversing diseases like diabetis, obesity, stroke, high bloodpressue, and cancer, which are however directly caused by the hormones, fats and cholesterol, found in meat, milk, egg and cheese. It might be worth adding that thus, no living being has to disgustingly suffer and die for merely the stimulation of something insignificant and primitive as just minutes of simulation of our tastebuds, that's immediately forgotten afterwards anyways.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "ShadowZZZ", "channel": "UCb94VCzy71hQXxZqXyPa4Jg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/xwhSk3bZE97vRiMf3Dw90l3hHmg5baCVkUDff4I9C4aZZT7t8hLl29v4x559RwWnrqiJRnFCpw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is perfectly normal to not believe in climate change if one lives in a city or place that is not affected  much by it. We can't see the Co2 absorption of infra red radiation since it happens on the very small scale which is invisible to the naked eye on the molecular and atomic level. Also infra red radiation is invisible to the naked eye. We need night vision glasses to see it.  The ground state of the electron cloud of every molecule and atom is equal to a certain wavelength and it will only absorb electromagnetic radiation at an exact wavelength. Carbon dioxide  will only absorb EMR at the infra red wavelength. All other radiation gamma, x rays, ultra violet, visible light and radio waves pass right through the Co2 molecule but NOT infra red. Co2 absorbs it.  When the Sunlight in the visible light and some ultra violet hits the ground, it is absorbed and heats up. The ground emits this thermal energy as infra red, a light our eyes can't see. The infra red gets absorbed by the  Co2 molecules which vibrate and rotate which is the same as heat. The co2 molecules heat the air and the ground since some infra red radiation is  reflected back towards the ground.  The energy levels are different in every atom and molecule so that each molecule has its own spectra, a unique fingerprint which allows us to tell what the elements in stars and planetary atmospheres without ever traveling there.  Every gas has its unique absorption and emission spectra.  One can get a telescope and put on a spectrascope or  diffraction grating and see the spectra of Venus for example. It will show Co2 spectra which is at the infra red wavelength.  The spectra or spectral bands and lines ARE the energy levels unique to that atom. Everywhere in the universe Co2 will  always show an infra red spectral absorption lines.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Geoffrey Hillend", "channel": "UCIsX91RPJcVEFNRsNCUUzWw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRTPNoY8idWaaT8k_OCA2b71Q-mAxuWPeLmfQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also plant fossils were found which can only grow in a warm climate.  The north and south polar caps only began to form about 20 million years ago, but 50 million years ago there were mass extinctions due to climate change from the removal of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plant photosynthesis which removes CO2 and replaces it with oxygen. Also the carbon cycle has removed some of the CO2.  There were max extinctions in the polar regions 50 million years ago due to a drop in temperature there from a drop in carbon dioxide levels.  We do know what the climate of the past billion years is due to the oxygen 16 18 isotope ratio which tells the ice covering level, temperature and rainfall. These can be found in the fossil shells of dead animals.  70 million years ago, the CO2 level was over 500 ppm and the temperatures were higher but not so high that no animals can live.  Today's animals can't survive then because they have become adapted to through evolution to todays lower temperatures.  The mass extinctions of the past are due to animals of that time being adapted to warmer temperatures.  If we raise the temperature, then we can have mass extinctions.  Also the sea level was 280 feet higher 70 million years ago due to the carbon dioxide levels being higher than 500 ppm which is why we don't want to go above that level in the future.  We also have to remove some of the CO2 and get it back down to 280ppm, otherwise we will have a permanent sea level rise of at least 20 feet since the CO2 level was 415 ppm in the Pliocene and see level was over 20 feet higher.  Plants and the carbon cycle have drawn down the CO levels over millions of years and we put a lot of it  back in only 170 years.

On the continent of Arctica there is a fossil record of petrified plants that could only live in a warm climate, temperature climate.   Dinosaur bones from a wide range of age have been found there, the latest was 70 million years, 120 million and 220 million, etc. A common misconception was these are due to plate tectonics or continental drift and Ant Arctica was in a different place, but it not 70 million years ago where it was relatively in the same location due to the slowness of continental drift.  70 million year ago, the carbon dioxide levels were over 500 ppm and the there were no polar ice caps due to the higher temperatures, but these were not so high nothing could live and the sea level was 280 feet higher which is what will happen if we let the CO2 levels go over 500 ppm. The animals today did not exist then due to evolution.  Most the ones from the past have become extinct due to natural climate change, the loss of carbon dioxide through plants removing the CO2 through photosynthesis and the carbon cycle. The animals of that past were adapted only to warmer temperatures. It's just that todays biosphere is adapted to lower temperatures which is why there will problems if we raise the temperature.  Everyone will be affected.  There are many misconceptions about climate change including the thought that we don't know what the climate of the prehistoric was over deep time but we do.  It's not just the ice core sample which show bubbles of air trapped with higher CO2 levels in the past, but the ice core samples also show the oxygen 16 18 ration which tells the precipitation, ice coving level and temperature.  These are infallible.  Also the science and physics which supports climate change is complicated and there is a large amount of knowledge which supports it.

Also plant fossils were found which can only grow in a warm climate.  The north and south polar caps only began to form about 20 million years ago, but 50 million years ago there were mass extinctions due to climate change from the removal of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plant photosynthesis which removes CO2 and replaces it with oxygen. Also the carbon cycle has removed some of the CO2.  There were max extinctions in the polar regions 50 million years ago due to a drop in temperature there from a drop in carbon dioxide levels.  We do know what the climate of the past billion years is due to the oxygen 16 18 isotope ratio which tells the ice covering level, temperature and rainfall. These can be found in the fossil shells of dead animals.  70 million years ago, the CO2 level was over 500 ppm and the temperatures were higher but not so high that no animals can live.  Today's animals can't survive then because they have become adapted to through evolution to todays lower temperatures.  The mass extinctions of the past are due to animals of that time being adapted to warmer temperatures.  If we raise the temperature, then we can have mass extinctions.  Also the sea level was 280 feet higher 70 million years ago due to the carbon dioxide levels being higher than 500 ppm which is why we don't want to go above that level in the future.  We also have to remove some of the CO2 and get it back down to 280ppm, otherwise we will have a permanent sea level rise of at least 20 feet since the CO2 level was 415 ppm in the Pliocene and see level was over 20 feet higher.  Plants and the carbon cycle have drawn down the CO levels over millions of years and we put a lot of it  back in only 170 years.

Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. After 2045 climate change would give more problems and by 2100 we would start having major natural disasters. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. These companies require so much boring underground water, the water when pumped out of the ground they flatten and sink the ground.\nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \nWhat about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. For that we have to make things free to the people.\n\n2. Make Things Free To The Peoples\n\nAs I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless and lose their business. \nSo to solve this problem the world has to make food, clothing, shelter, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government's of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people's who have lost their source of income and those who are already unemployed, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.\nMany people's should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming. \n\n3. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.\nThis must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth's pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won't even have to research on how to clear the earth's pollution.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.\nThis must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth's pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won't even have to research on how to clear the earth's pollution.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugy3t9P6FcJqgieknPZ4AaABAg.8vS0Y_20Qri9B9SesF22rn", "text": "Solutions For Pollution Problems\n\n1. Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. After 2045 climate change would give more problems and by 2100 we would start having major natural disasters. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. These companies require so much boring underground water, the water when pumped out of the ground they flatten and sink the ground.\nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \nWhat about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. For that we have to make things free to the people.\n\n2. Make Things Free To The Peoples\n\nAs I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless and lose their business. \nSo to solve this problem the world has to make food, clothing, shelter, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government's of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people's who have lost their source of income and those who are already unemployed, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.\nMany people's should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming. \n\n3. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.\nThis must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth's pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won't even have to research on how to clear the earth's pollution.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I guess there were greenhouse gasses anyway, even before man? Must have been the Dino farts. We all recognize that since the 50s or 60s, we have known there was a problem, and as human nature goes, we don't worry about it till it's at crisis point. Are we mad at our ancestors before us? This video suggests to \"do something\" we are to go around and make our voices heard, about Climate Change, and nonlistenjng politicians, to DO something. I would suggest what we control is no more than ourselves. Of course it's possible to influence others, but influence doesn't happen in a spirit of superiority and anger. If you want people to do things or buy from you, you MUST make them like you. Therefore, it looks like we aren't making much progress. I'm an adult. I don't like being blasted about what I need to do. What about the people before us? What about instead of blasting others we do something to improve situation, and tell others what we did? The statement in this video that $ is only reason the World continues to use fossil fuels is way off. Fossil fuels provide heat. Maybe ok with some if we don't have heat and people freeze in their own homes, but if the frozen person is related to you, still all good? Why haven't grocers upgraded to paperless shopping? No wrapping, cardboard, plastics to package products? You know, like the old time milk man. Instead of \"calling others out\" why aren't leaders meeting with Grocery Companies to put pressure, like PETA? All we need us available permanent vessels to pack food into, and large bins holding bulk foods, from which customers fill their containers? How about no baggues, paper cups plates, zip locks? That's easy enough. Stop driving so much instead have grocer, hair dresser,  insurance, all manner of business in mobile offices, working thru streets of neighborhoods. \nI heard last winter that a group of college student activists went to the dean if their college to insist he stop investing into stocks associated with fossil fuels.

{"cid": "Ugz902IdCciBS9M8VJR4AaABAg.8uouWszfRbm9B9SlavPOzP", "text": "Solutions For Pollution Problems\n\n1. Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. After 2045 climate change would give more problems and by 2100 we would start having major natural disasters. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. These companies require so much boring underground water, the water when pumped out of the ground they flatten and sink the ground.\nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \nWhat about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. For that we have to make things free to the people.\n\n2. Make Things Free To The Peoples\n\nAs I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless and lose their business. \nSo to solve this problem the world has to make food, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government's of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people's who have lost their source of income and those who are already unemployed, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.\nMany people's should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming. \n\n3. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.\nThis must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth's pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won't even have to research on how to clear the earth's pollution.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(a distinct Burning-Fossil-Fuel isotope)\r\nWhen we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, \r\nwe observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). \r\n\r\nHow do we know that recent CO<sub>2</sub> increases are due to human activities?

{"cid": "Ugz902IdCciBS9M8VJR4AaABAg.8uouWszfRbm9MvUj3NWpE5", "text": " @Rick Kooi  There is constant balance of the sun and planets. Our distance to the sun depends on the sun's wobble caused by the other planets. Each year we reach the closest we get to the sun and the farthest we get from the sun. Currently because we are closest during the norther hemisphere's winter and farthest from sun during the summer, we are having mild winters and summers. The southern hemisphere is having hotter summers and colder winters. It all changes with the predictable movement and alignment of the planets. The sun has 7 year cycles and 11 year cycles and who know what else because we just started tracking it. The short cycles of our life time are predictable and we can't change a thing. A hurricane that covers half of Florida can power the eastern United States and over its life span has more power than all the almost one thousand nuclear bombs men set off. The gasses have very little control because of water. Water vaper is the major thermal controller. It's freezing and boiling points set the evaporation rates that maintain temperature by the cycling of water to cool the earth. More energy from the sun and the cycle rate increases and we have more storms and more rain. When the received sun energy is low we have a lower water cycle and drought. CO2 follows temp change, it does not drive it. The Democrats want to go back to the lower levels of CO2 in the past that mark drought and famine. The dust bowl was the mark of low temperatures and low CO2 ~ 180 PPM down from the high of 40,000 parts per million 450 million years ago. The drop from 4% CO2 to 0.018 % CO2 was almost linear except 300 million years ago when the earth froze and every thing died and it dropped to around 200 PPM or 0.02 % CO2. How low can CO2 levels go and before plants start to die? It is about at 180 PPM. What we see is the tree line falling. Man can only climb so high up the side of the mountain before he passes out from lack of O2 and falls. The trees depend on the CO2 concentration to survive too. The Germans did a study because the trees around their ski lodge were dying. Lowering CO2 (carbon drought) will lower the tree line. I can walk up to the tree line and I am fine. If it walks down to me my garden will die. Currently the CO2 level is around 400 PPM and the world is regreening itself. Drought and famine are gone and we can now feed everyone. The left ignores the science and pushes lies and hate to gain power. If we let socialist lead we will be left in the dark, hungry and cold. They are the only ones running out of time. We now understand the all the money we through at climate change will be wasted with the biggest share ending up in their pockets. Bloggers are not scientist.  See: Richard Lindzen.

It is because of the trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere that absorb and re-emit energy that Earth’s average temperature is not permanently well below the freezing temperature of water.\n\n“However, one needs to distinguish between the natural greenhouse effect and the enhanced greenhouse effect. The natural greenhouse effect is caused by the natural amounts of greenhouse gases, and is vital to life. In the absence of the natural greenhouse effect the surface of the Earth would be approximately 33 degrees Celsius cooler. The enhanced greenhouse effect refers to the additional radiative forcing resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases induced by human activities. The main greenhouse gases whose concentrations are rising are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and ozone in the lower atmosphere.”\n\nhttps://samslair.blogspot.com/search?q=Greenhouse+effect&max-results=20&by-date=false&m=1", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Sam Lair", "channel": "UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHI0ofAQcclqyQYWFUekfrl6JC9l_6ODYX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Co2 is good for the environment, plants can't survive without out it, but C02 isn't a pollutant.in fact, Co2 is a heavy gas so it can't reach the atmosphere. the only way Co2 can reach the atmosphere is by the aviation industry.

Then he goes on to say  that damage to the environment caused by human emmissions is the equivalent  of 400,000 atomic bombs exploding every day. Where, in hell, did he come up with that figure? It so happens more atmospheric pollution is caused by natural phenomena such as toxic fumes emitted by fissures in the ground  after an earthquake.gasses that spew into the by erupting volcanoes and periods of increased solar spot activity to name but a few. Also slight changes in the earth orbit around or even an imperceptibly slight change in the earth tilt can, and often does, cause drastic changes in climate.

No such consensus or settled science exists. As indicated by the petition text and signatory list, a very large number of American scientists reject this hypothesis.\n\nPublicists at the United Nations, Mr. Al Gore, and their supporters frequently claim that only a few “skeptics” remain – skeptics who are still unconvinced about the existence of a catastrophic human-caused global warming emergency.\n\nIt is evident that 31,487 Americans with university degrees in science – including 9,029 PhDs, are not \"a few.\" Moreover, from the clear and strong petition statement that they have signed, it is evident that these 31,487 American scientists are not “skeptics.”\n\nThese scientists are instead convinced that the human-caused global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment of the Earth.\n\nNobody can ignore the fact that 31,487 American scientists have signed this petition, including 9,029 with PhDs – http://www.petitionproject.org", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Michael Swiss", "channel": "UCJD7zGWyRk-KXPzJJBPK8xQ", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTwIZ9cfYmaCAn7eI1NdOqafJ-WUaITckH4k1zDbg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Only the naive use this term. \n'Anthropogenic global warming', is the correct term and AGW is a myth created by globalists. The alarmists use 'climate change' instead of AGW because they know that AGW is not significant.\nHumans have put back into the atmosphere a small fraction of the CO2 that nature has taken out. Plants are prospering because of this. \nThe people I listen too are the experienced climate scientists who have spent most of their lives on studying and researching climate. Scientists who are honest enough to give us their truthful opinion and who have an in-depth understanding of the Earth's climate.\nSome of these scientists might gain from Oil Companies who want to reward them for reducing the hysteria, but most of these scientists are retired, have no further interest in gaining money and have not accepted money. They are genuine in their expressed beliefs and want to expose the lies.\nThere are many videos of older highly acclaimed scientists exposing the alarmists. Eg Prof Ivar Giaever, Dr Don Easterbrook,  Murry Salby, Prof Ian Plimer, Prof Bob Carter, Prof Fred Singer, Prof Freeman Dyson, Prof Patrick Michaels, Prof Garth Paltridge, Dr Richard Siegmund Lindzen etc. \nOlder scientists can more easily speak their mind because they have nothing to lose w.r.t. career prospects.\n\nFor the politically aware, view the channel RockingMrE .

Any NOAA numbers that showed there was an increase in temperature were manipulated, and what we have left is pre-manipulation of a natural warming and cooling trend.\n\nThe real temperatures we are dealing with today are not historic, and in fact, are lower than pre-industrial revolution temperatures.\n\nAl Gore Scared: Latest NOAA Data Proves There Was NEVER 'Global Warming'\nRev-In Article\nREAD: Climate Change Hoax: NOAA Caught MASSIVELY Manipulating Temperature Readings AGAIN\nIt was all one…great..BIG…hoax.\n\nThat temperatures were warmer in the 30’s and have generally decreased as CO2 has increased, wrecks greenhouse gas theory. So the NOAA had to “adjust” the data to make it look like the US is warming.\n\nThe problem, is that time and time again, they have been caught adjusting.\n\nThey do not just adjust recent temperatures to show them warmer, they adjusted, significantly, numbers from the early part of the 20th Century downward. This, enabled them to perpetrate the global warming hoax.\nRealClimateScience explains:\nAdsense_Native_In_Article\n\n    The NOAA data tampering produces a spectacular hockey stick of scientific fraud. It becomes the basis of vast amounts of downstream junk climate science. Pre-2000 temperatures are progressively cooled Post-2000 temperatures are warmed. This year has been a particularly spectacular episode of data tampering by NOAA. They introduced nearly 2.5 degrees of fake warming since 1895.\n\n    Most of these adjustments are due to simply making up data. Every month, a certain percentage of the 1,218 United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) stations fail to report their data. The temperature gets estimated by NOAA using a computer model. Missing data is marked in the USHCN database with an “E” – meaning “estimated.” In 1970, about 10% of the data was missing. That number has increased to almost 50%. That translates to almost half of the current adjusted data being fake.\n\n    The fabricated temperatures have warmed four degrees since 1970, relative to the adjusted temperatures which were based on actual station data. This shows that the warming trend in the US claimed by NOAA is based on computer models. Not actual thermometer data or even adjusted thermometer data.\n\n    But here is the real smoking gun of fraud by NOAA. The adjustments being made almost perfectly match atmospheric CO2 levels – showing that the data is being altered precisely to match global warming theory.\n\n    Science doesn’t get any worse than how NOAA handles US temperature data. NASA uses the NOAA data as the basis for their temperature graphs, which have also been massively altered to turn cooling into warming.\n\nREAD: Liberal Entitlement: District Attorney Lehmberg Blames Cops During Drunk Driving Temper Tantrum [WATCH]\n\nWhat is ironic, is that even their adjusted data in no way supports their claims that CO2 is causing catastrophic warming. The CO2 increases have been big and even the adjusted, bogus data does not reflect it in any scary way.\nBut Al Gore has become very wealthy on the back of his great global warming hoax.\n\nEach 1 degree change (either direction) translates to $1.62 trillion in carbon credit revenue. Al Gore is awarded $1.62 billion for his research allowing 10% ($162 million) for his salary.\n\nAs Al Gore and his claims continue to be proven false. He continues to be discovered to be a snake oil salesman. Scientists are now beginning to call him and all other global warming alarmists liars.\n\nThere are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative. 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields.\nLockerdome-In Article\n\nMany of those scientists who signed the petition were encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity.\n\nAl Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica. There was also an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe.\nAnother lie is that 98% consensus…yeah…global warming hoax!\n\nClimate Change activists from Al Gore down have been saying for almost a decade that 98% of the scientific community believe in man-made climate change.\n\nBut what they fail to tell you is that 98% comes from an equation of 75 out of 77 climate change scientists. Only with Common Core math can you make 75 scientists equal 98% of the entire scientific community!\n\nAnd that folks, is the rest of the story.\nRev-Below Article\n0\n353 \nShare FacebookTwitterGoogle+ReddIt\nLockerdome-Below Article\n\nPrev Post\n\nGov Advisory Group: Abortion is Safe, Effective\n\nNext Post\n\nBreaking Report: Source of WH Leak Found, Much Worse Than We Thought…It’s About National Security!

Declining birth rates over the past 50 years mean that Europe is only producing 1.6 children per woman – hardly satisfactory to compete on the global stage against increasing populations of fit and able youth from the emerging economies of India and Africa and South America.A prominent reason for reduced fertility is the age-related decline in the number and quality of eggs as women in all European countries wait longer to have their first birth.Mass infertility is the 'logical conclusion' to the current patterns, according to one expert. \"If the data on sperm counts is extrapolated to its logical conclusion,European men will have little or no reproductive capacity from 2060 onward,\" wrote Chris Barratt, Professor of Reproductive Medicine at the University of Dundee  Europe Infertility testing and treatment market generated a revenue of $5874 million in 2016 and is anticipated to contribute $9874 million by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 6.01%. Europe has the largest market share of In-vitro fertilization market. Variation in skin color is the most noticeable of human polymorphisms. As visually dominant mammals, we readily notice differences in skin color in each other. As primates who uniquely use language to create categories, we readily give names to these differences. Since the mid-18th century, skin color has been the single most important physical trait used to define human groups. The prevalence of skin cancers is highest in lightly pigmented people who experience chronic or intense episodic exposures to strong UVR in places far from their ancestral homelands (MacKie et al., 2009). Skin cancers are mostly a consequence of modern human migrations and resulting mismatches between skin pigmentation and geography or lifestyle.dark skin pigmentation in humans had evolved primarily to prevent reduction of fertility due to the photolysis of folate present in cutaneous blood vessels (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000). We presented evidence that folate depletion by UVR would precipitate folate deficiencies that would, in turn, lead to potentially fatal birth defects such as neural tube defects (NTDs). Dark skin pigmentation in humans evolved primarily to prevent reduction of fertility due to the photolysis of folate present in cutaneous blood vessels and destruction of DNA (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000).Folate is important especially in rapidly dividing cells, such as those of the embryo and seminiferous tubules. Thus folate deficiencies caused by UVR would potentially affect both female and male fertility. Low folate levels cause derangements of folate-mediated 1-carbon metabolism that lead to serious diseases and birth defects. Folate deficiencies cause faulty DNA replication due to strand breaks caused by misincorporation of excessive uracil into DNA (Han et al., 2007; Stover, 2009). Studies from Africa have demonstrated that black people have higher vitamin B12 (cobalamin) levels than do white people. The dark skin of humans naturally arose because women who were darker skinned carried more normal fetuses to term than those who were light skinned. In dark skinned populations the MC1R locus is extremely conserved, suggesting powerful selective constraints which prevent sequence variation. No matter the phylogenetic relationships between dark skinned populations there is a consensus sequence which seems to have been selected for deep in the human past which remains the norm across these groups (i.e., though Melanesians and Africans are both very distantly related their dark skin is the end product of the same genetic architecture). But counterbalancing the need to block sunlight due to reduction in folate levels is the fact that vitamin D synthesis requires a minimum level of radiation to be catalyzed. Reduced vitamin D levels in caucasians not only result in bone deformations (i.e., rickets), but a heightened sensitivity to a host of diseases.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Mic Theory", "channel": "UCcxRnnsdGekXLq2vJmdUdbA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTul-K7JD3foTaSPej2p0p5aiegWmAiNnJCtiv4Gw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Look in to geology. Look into the history of the earth. Learn about the water cycle. Learn about the carbon cycle. Learn about BIOLOGY. PLEASE. Seriously, no one disputes that climate changes. It always has and always will, no matter what we do. But I beg you, learn a little about how life on earth works and how it has evolved before you brand carbon dioxide as some sort of 'zombie apocalypse' pollutant that we need to banish from the atmosphere for ever. Without CO2 in the atmosphere, zero life, yes ZERO, life exists in the form we currently entertain it. Having CO2 levels at 'target' 150ppm levels will essentially suffocate the photosynthesising plant life. And I don't need to tell you that if the plants die, we die. Not because we can't eat them, but because they produce the oxygen used in our own respiration. To say the CO2 levels currently are historically high is simply wrong. Even at current 400ppm levels, plants are on starvation rations. Look into geology and you'll realise hat levels of CO2 topping 2000ppm are not uncommon. Many many other, and more important, factors play a role in the climate of the planet apart from CO2. Water vapour and clouds will do multiples more to effect it than CO2 ever will. Please, don't just believe what you hear. Don't just believe me. Look into it. Do some study and draw your own conclusions.

But have you ever asked the question; 'what would it be like if we do stop the warming and actually cool the planet down by 2 or 3 degrees?'.

There are a number of extremely merited scientists, some Nobel prize laureates, that do not agree with these views at all (based on science). None was represented here!! \nPlease note that this idea was originally titled \"Global Warming\", because CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Since we are now calling it \"Climate Change\", it would be fair to explain why CO2 (more specifically - man made) is still considered the sole culprit???\nI would personally be happy with nuclear power, because it is the most environmentally friendly method to produce energy. That has now become an impossibility, because of required safety measures. I find it extremely odd that people talk about fossile fuel as if it originates from outer space. See, carbon is a very rare commodity on the planet earth. However, it is the sole basis of life on this planet. Anything organic is based on carbon. Originally it was all in the atmosphere as CO2. With the death of living organisms, it started to produce deposits in deep layers of the sea. In other words, we are just recycling that carbon. \nThe simple fact is that you cannot burn anything (fossile or renewable) without producing CO2. Stop the burning and vast areas become uninhabitable immediately.

{"cid": "UgyPzZ4Fgss9EL2E5Wx4AaABAg", "text": "First, I believe that global warming is real.  You'd have to have your head in the sand to believe otherwise.  The \"facts\" support it. I've been trying to find articles or videos that support the case that man is causing global warming.  I wanted to find out more to arm myself in a debate.  Surprisingly, after watching hundreds of videos and reading several articles/papers, I've still found nothing that is convincing.  Most videos are like this one, which show the possible effects of long-term warming and make vague references to man being the cause.  But still, no hard statistics.  I'm a numbers guy and run in circles with other numbers people.  We are convinced by evidence and hard facts.  We consider videos like this more partisan propaganda vs education.  \n\nCan anyone help me learn more?  This is what I've learned so far:\n\n- There is a correlation between greenhouse gasses and the earths temperature.  Some scientists say greenhouse gasses cause a temperature rise and others say the temperature rise causes the gases.  I've not seen hard evidence either way...only circumstantial.\n\n- After researching what \"greenhouse gasses\" are, it appears that about 3.7% is made up of CO2 and of that the rest (95%) is mainly water vapor.  Of the 3.7%, it looks like the manmade portion is around 11% of the 3.7%.  That translates into man made CO2 comprising less than 1/2 percent (0.4%) of total greenhouse gasses.  Of the 0.4%, scientist on both sides agree that it will take decades to reduce and at best we might get it down to 0.3% if the entire world participates. For those not good with numbers think about it this way. Take a pie and cut it into 100 pieces.  Then take one of those small pieces and cut it into 10 tiny pieces. Now pick up one of those tiny pieces...that is the amount we, as the world, might have control over.\n\n- Of all the manmade CO2, China, India and Russia make up almost half of that.  At the last UN Global Warming Summit, these countries stated that they are not believers that man is causing the warming and have refused to participate in any global reduction agreements.   So, now cut that tiny piece of pie in half again.\n\n- The US makes up about 16% of all manmade CO2 (. At the last UN Global Warming Summit, the US pledged it would reduce its manmade CO2 by 28% over the coming years. Some economist estimate this would cost close to $24 Trillion to accomplish or more than the total annual GDP of the US. \n\nAgain, just trying to learn more of the facts.  If you have any, please share.

Current changes in climate, sea level and ice are within variability. Atmospheric CO2 is the lowest for 500 million years. Climate has always been driven by the Sun, the Earth’s orbit and plate tectonics: the oceans, atmosphere and life respond. Humans have made their mark on the planet, thrived in warm times and struggled in cool times. The hypothesis that humans can actually change climate is unsupported by evidence from geology, archaeology, history and astronomy. \nA new ignorance fills the yawning spiritual gap in Western society. Climate change politics is religious fundamentalism masquerading as science. Its triumph is computer models unrelated to observations in nature.

I take it you know this benefits \npeople who want nations to industrialize under Agenda 21.\n\nSun Spot Cycles are far more than 11 year cycles http://www.windows2universe.org/sun/activity/sunspot_history.html\n\nFollowing Earth’s last ice age, which peaked 20,000 years ago, the \nAntarctic warmed between two and three times the average temperature \nincrease worldwide.\n\n\"The Neglected Sun\" attempts to explain why the IPCC's predictions of \nclimate doom are so off the mark because the IPCC focuses solely on \nheating from human-related carbon dioxide. The authors state in \nrelentlessly annotated, scientifically-supported arguments that natural \nclimate variations play at least as large a role as carbon dioxide in \nmodifying the Earth's climate. Cyclical variations in ocean temperature \n(critically the Pacific Decadal Oscillation), variations in the sun's \nmagnetic field, and the sun's impact on cloud formation are shown to be \ncritically important factors that are likely to impact our climate going\n forward. The authors even make the case for a slight cooling of the \nEarth in coming decades, offsetting the heating from anthropogenic \ncarbon dioxide.\n\n\n via a number of indirect means (e.g., ice core samples) for estimating \nprevious climatic conditions over many millennia that the earths has \nundergone significant changes in the past before man-made CO2 was a \nfactor Of particular interest to today's discussion is the \"Little Ice \nAge\" 1400 to 1900 CE, and the \"Medieval Warm Period\" 1000 to 1400 CE. \nThe latter experienced temperature conditions similar to our present \n\"unprecedented\" climate.\n\n Climate change is due to galactic cosmic rays emitted from distant \nexploding stars that trigger the formation of low clouds. Cosmic rays \ngenerate muons (elementary particles) that trigger the seeding of clouds\n by forming cloud condensation nuclei, on which water droplets form. \nThose low clouds have an umbrella cooling effect over our climate. The \nSun has a fluctuating magnetic shield that partly protects against such \nrays. When the Sun is active and its magnetic shield is strong, the flow\n of cosmic rays is reduced, the low cloud cover diminishes and \ntemperatures rise.\n\nIn addition to cosmic rays and their effect on Earth temperatures, there\n is a great deal of information on ice drilling and the wealth of \nancient climate data stored in layers of ice in Greenland and the \nAntarctic. Much of that information contradicts what is often heard in \nthe media and political speeches. Again, why hasn't this been in the \nmainstream news? My otherwise favorite radio network, NPR, speaks of \n\"concensus\" among \"scientists\" and labels anyone who doesn't buy climate\n change concensus as a flat-earther. Genuine scientists don't reach \nconcensus on much of anything except maybe gravity, and this book is one\n more bit of evidence that there is no concensus among real scientists \non global warming.\n\n\n The sun, including its magnetic cycles, and inner dynamics, exerts the \nmajor control on climate variability and climate change.\n\n Six different cycles of solar activity are documented. The climate \nhistory of the earth, including the last 150 years, correlate closely \nwith these cycles which range from 11 to 2300 years. Moreover, some are \namplified long term by Milankovich orbital parameters.\n\n The sun’s quantitative influence on climate change exceeds the \ninfluence of anthropogenic CO2, although the authors acknowledge that \nanthropogenic CO2 has a minor role to play in raising global \ntemperatures. The supporting arguments are well-buttressed and \nconvincing\n\nThe current temperature “Pause” is explained in terms of solar cycles \nand decreasing solar radiation. Likely, a period of cooling is ahead as \nsolar radiation entering a diminished phase.\n\n (Has the IPCC really done its homework?), 6 (The misunderstood climate \namplifiers), and 7 (A look into the future) provide the most detailed \nand accurate critique of the UN-IPCC’s reports. (I call it withering \ndissection). Thus, projected future temperature increases are expected \nto be much less than the UN-IPCC infers and the climate ‘crisis’ is \noverblown far too much. These chapters are incisive.\n\n EU UK and German climate and energy policy. They are instructive \nbecause the policies are failing, particularly as electricity costs have\n skyrocketed since implementation. This is becoming a universal problem.\n\n\n“The New Little Ice Age Has Started.” This is the unambiguous title of a\n new study from one of the world’s most prestigious scientific \ninstitutions, the Russian Academy of Science’s Pulkovo Observatory in \nSt. Petersburg. “The average temperature around the globe will fall by \nabout 1.5 C when we enter the deep cooling phase of the Little Ice Age, \nexpected in the year 2060,” the study states. “The cooling phase will \nlast for about 45-65 years, for four to six 11-year cycles of the Sun, \nafter which on the Earth, at the beginning of the 22nd century, will \nbegin the new, next quasi-bicentennial cycle of warming.”  http://www.financialpost.com/m/wp/fp-comment/blog.html?b=business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/lawrence-solomon-proof-that-a-new-ice-age-has-already-started-is-stronger-than-ever-and-we-couldnt-be-less-prepared", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Robin Breeds", "channel": "UCAkcClkAX6Vg_mHXByzMMfQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT-2UqIG6pwEjMa0Nv3upE53I61K-t3BFXWWMmaiQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugg1q35x24v3dngCoAEC", "text": "The Earth receives all its heat energy from a single source that is hundred million miles away, the Sun and therefore if we want to understand temperature patterns observed on our planet, we must understand temperature patterns of the source of that heat, that of the Sun. John Casey traces the activity of the Sun through the history and attempts to correlate it to the warming/cooling periods observed on the Earth. He was the first one to predict back in 2007 that we will start to experience much colder winters and wet weather 3-4 years later and that trend is to continue for another 20-30 years. And so far, he was right. \n\n It is the Sun which controls all of our Climate. GW is a scam which has other agendas to meet creating   and is nothing to do with the Truth. The research presented by John Casey is very through and is backed up by plenty of evidence in the form of graphs of Climate temperature records and Sunspot counts. He has confirmed that the well recorded, historical, very cold periods of the Maunder and Dalton Minima when there were very severe Winters world wide and thousands died as a consequence, were part of a 206 year long Solar Cycle of heat output variation affecting all the World's climate. Another shocking discovery he has made is a very close correlation with severe earthquakes and Volcanic eruptions caused probably by shrinkage of Earth's crust due to cooling of the Earth in these periods. Prepare yourself for about 40 years of very cold and wet weather plus more earth changes. Do not believe the incorrect scare story of us causing Global Warming. GW actually stopped in 2006. We are NOT responsible for GW and the guilt trip that is being pushed onto us is not based on the truth. We should instead prepare for a Mini Ice Age. And this is based on easily verified Scientific Fact.\n\nJohn L. Casey, a former White House national space policy advisor, N.A.S.A. headquarters consultant, and space shuttle engineer tells the truth about ominous changes taking place in the climate and the Sun. Casey's research into the Sun's activity, which began four years ago, resulted in discovery of a solar cycle that is now reversing from its global warming phase to that of dangerous global cooling for the next thirty years or more. This new cold climate will dramatically impact the world's citizens. In Cold Sun, he provides evidence of the following: • The end of global warming • The beginning of a \"solar hibernation,\" a historic reduction in the energy output of the Sun • A long-term drop in the Earth's temperatures • The start of the next climate change to decades of dangerously cold weather • The high probability of record earthquakes and volcanic eruptions A sobering look at the Earth's future, Cold Sun predicts worldwide, crop-destroying cold; food shortages", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Robin Breeds", "channel": "UCAkcClkAX6Vg_mHXByzMMfQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT-2UqIG6pwEjMa0Nv3upE53I61K-t3BFXWWMmaiQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(I live in Corpus Christi and sometimes we can't go swimming in the summer because of the algae blooms, yet the news won't address why it's happening.)  And it consumes a lot of water and causes deforestation. It is rare that any company will mention this though, because they are afraid of getting sued or having a target painted on their back. Animal agriculture companies are so strong that they will hire a hit man, depending on the country you are in. Dorothy Stang was assassinated by a hit man from animal agriculture companies. She was a wonderful woman. Oprah Winfrey was sued by animal agriculture companies just for saying \"I will never eat meat again.\" On national TV when she was interviewing a farmer who was addressing the cause of mad cow disease.

Antarctica is going nowhere. \nRaise earths mean temperature 10 deg C and Antarctica would still not go anywhere, it would still contain the bulk of it's current ice volume. Possibly some of the outer rim floating ice could met, but none of that floating ice will cause a single millimeter in sea level change. (Anyone remember basic school physics?)\n\nTypical of scaremongers this video tries to scare people by showing earths heat in terms of \"Hiroshima nuclear bombs\". Extreme scaremongering.\n\nGet in your petrol fueled car and participate in giving us a greener and more food productive planet. At he Co2 levels we have today life is on the brink of starvation. If nature keeps depositing carbon in the earths crust then at some time in the future Co2 would reach below 150ppm. And life on earth would die.\n\nGreenhouse growers put up to 1200ppm inh their greenhouse. Not for heat, but for growth. Plants are carbon based. Plants use the carbon in the atmosphere to build mass. We eat plants. Or animal that in turned ate plants. We are carbon based. Our bodies are built from Co2 that was in the atmosphere. Below 150ppm photosynthesis stops. And we all die. \nGive life on earth a better chance for long time survival by turning as much deposited carbon in the earths crust into Co2 as possible.\nPlanning to get a large muscle car from the -70s myself, because higher Co2 is good for us all.

This is how the Great Lakes were formed by glaciers.   Too many clouds will cool the Earth.  It doesn't matter if the clouds are ash from volcanoes.   Too many climatologists, and not the quasi scientists, are providing inaccurate statistics refute the severity of climate changes.  Polar shift and magnetic changes are in all probability the next extinction cycle as there have been at least 5 in prehistoric times as geological experts have purported.  Humans need the cleanest environment for health but there are current scientific means of reducing carbon emissions without putting all people under inappropriate financial and social stress.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Lars", "channel": "UC1KveqAw6LqtqVVDd_bxeHw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRYm_njMJfNjyOVVf9yuHPIrHNe_-q-9hkwGw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Please, please, PLEASE just do a little research before churning out videos copied directly from media outputs. Look in to geology. Look into the history of the earth. Learn about the water cycle. Learn about the carbon cycle. Learn about BIOLOGY. PLEASE. Seriously, no one disputes that climate changes. It always has and always will, no matter what we do. But I beg you, learn a little about how life on earth works and how it has evolved before you brand carbon dioxide as some sort of 'zombie apocalypse' pollutant that we need to banish from the atmosphere for ever. Without CO2 in the atmosphere, zero life, yes ZERO, life exists in the form we currently entertain it. Having CO2 levels at 'target' 150ppm levels will essentially suffocate the photosynthesising plant life. And I don't need to tell you that if the plants die, we die. Not because we can't eat them, but because they produce the oxygen used in our own respiration. To say the CO2 levels currently are historically high is simply wrong. Even at current 400ppm levels, plants are on starvation rations. Look into geology and you'll realise hat levels of CO2 topping 2000ppm are not uncommon. Many many other, and more important, factors play a role in the climate of the planet apart from CO2. Water vapour and clouds will do multiples more to effect it than CO2 ever will. Please, don't just believe what you hear. Don't just believe me. Look into it. Do some study and draw your own conclusions. The climate may well be changing , but we're changing out of one of the coldest periods the earth has ever had, seriously. As Aden Bulgy correctly points out - we are currently in an Ice Age Ingerglacial. You want to stop the earth from warming up and doing what it it does. But have you ever asked the question; 'what would it be like if we do stop the warming and actually cool the planet down by 2 or 3 degrees?'. Probably not, because that would be getting closer to the 'zombie apocalypse' you talk of. Like it or lump it, life prefers warm to cold.

{"cid": "Ugj_Aioh8F8owHgCoAEC", "text": "Here is the transcript, in case anybody wants to use this video in his lessons: \n\nThis is a simple explanation of Climate Change based on an article in the New York Times. The average temperature on the surface of the planet has already increased 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, which may not seem like much, but think about it this way: the heat from human emissions is roughly equal to 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every single day. Future generations are in big trouble. But for now it will gradually continue to get warmer and storms will grow more intense, with longer periods of drought in between. But longer-term, if emissions continue to rise unchecked, the climate disasters will be so severe they will destabilize entire nations, send millions of refugees across borders, cause widespread extinction of most species on Earth and melt the polar ice caps, leaving most of the world’s coastal cities several feet underwater. All this could take centuries, but something like the sudden collapse of agriculture would trigger immediate chaos in society.\n\nBest case is we get our act together and begin to rapidly bring emission levels down. Meanwhile, Earth turns out to be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than we currently believe, plants and animals adapt quickly and major technological breakthroughs help society limit emissions and adjust to Climate Change. But, these are all the opposite of what we are actually seeing, so the only thing in our control is to limit emissions using all available tools and best behaviors currently at our disposal. \n\nWorst case, the collapse of food production causes spiraling prices and – as our capitalist utopia breaks down – billions starve as our world gets violent and messy real quick – kind of like a zombie apocalypse, but with extreme hunger spreading chaos instead. This would be coupled with the melting of the Antarctic ice-sheet, leading to rapidly rising seas, that would force us to abandon many of our greatest cities and all of the social and scientific progress that we were making within them. Adding insult to injury is the fact that many of the emissions were emitted while building these now abandoned, underwater metropolises. \n\nIf emissions continue unchecked, we are looking at a total rise of between 80 to 160 feet, which would occur if all the ice in the poles melted. So the oceans will rise, the real question is how fast? Scientists only have Earth’s history to base their predictions on, which suggests that the rate has occasionally hit 1 foot per decade. So we will have to adapt to an altered coastline sooner or later, but probably much sooner than later. Because computer forecasts only give us a range of future possibilities, the most important evidence comes from the studies of past climate conditions, which clearly show that every time the amount of carbon dioxide in the air rises, the Earth warms up, ice melts and the ocean rises. What’s important to remember here is that we are in uncharted territory – humans are pumping carbon dioxide into the air far faster than nature ever has before us. \n\nScientists have been publishing strong evidence that warming is making drought and heat waves more frequent, causing heavier rainstorms and more severe coastal flooding. But while the Internet has made us all more aware if weather disasters in distant countries, it is hard to prove these are all directly made worse by Climate Change. \n\nCanada and Russia both have vast, frozen lands and could see some economic benefits from a warmer climate. Putin and the Russians and until recently Canada as well, have been reluctant to make ambitious climate commitments. But expect that to change as these countries realize they will be swamped by millions of refugees from less fortunate nations. Libertarians and other political conservatives do not like the policies proposed to fight Climate Change and have chosen to try and block them by actively undermining the science. This effort has been funded by the oil and coal industry, who favor making money above all else. As more resources are devoted to solving the problem, our chances at big technological breakthroughs are improving, but we still should be spending about three times as much money as we currently are on these efforts according to several in-depth reports. \n\nYou can reduce your carbon footprint by doing things like plugging leaks in your home insulation, installing a smart thermostat, taking public transit, taking less airplane trips, buying an electric car and putting solar panels on your roof. A big one is eating less meat. But what’s really needed is for you to speak up and exercise your rights as a citizen, because strong, collective action through state and national policies is how we will make the most impact. \n\nConsidering that we have been ignoring scientists’ warnings since the 80’s to limit emissions, we are pretty late in the game. But we have finally reached a moment where nearly every country in the world agrees this is a huge problem and seem to commit to taking at least some kind of action. Leading corporations will continue to make bold promises to do their part, low-emission technologies will improve and many states and cities will go much further than any goal set by their national governments. The United States, the world’s biggest economy, is finally starting to move aggressively and China, the world’s largest emitter, is beginning to recognize that it needs to do the same, as many of its megacities will be underwater if the seas rise too high. But it is up to us, the ordinary citizens, to continue demanding our political leaders tackle Climate Change, the hardest problem that humanity has ever faced.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "ABBEYROADNW", "channel": "UCpemQFEHCfC9T8qkR16tJmQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbM3EsxZiTwS8jJE9LYCsRNfsz4UUcYDPQew=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Natural global warming, and cooling, is initiated by Milankovitch cycles. These orbital and axial variations influence the initiation of climate change in long-term natural cycles of 'ice ages' and 'warm periods'  known as 'glacial' and 'interglacial' periods. Our current climate forcing shows we are outside of that natural cycle forcing range.\n\\\r\nMilankovitch Cycles\r\nWhere are we currently in the natural Milankovitch cycle?\r\nPre-industrial forcing estimated around 0.0 to -0.1W/m2\r\n.\r\nThe natural cycle that people refer to regarding large scale climate change \r\nis the time between ice ages and warm periods. The long cycle time is about 100,000 years. \r\n.\r\nWe can spend around 20% of the cycle in an interglacial and around 80% in an ice age, \rdepending on where we are in these cycle influences.\n.\r\nWhat causes this is the natural cycles that influence earth climate – the Milankovitch Cycles?\r\nThe Milankovich cycles are caused by changes in the shape of the Earth's orbit around the sun, \r\nthe tilt of the Earth's rotation axis, and the wobble of our axis. \r\nThe mass and movement of the other planets in our solar system actually affect the Earth orbit \r\njust as our planetary mass similarly affects their orbits.\r\nAs the Earth's orbit changes so too do the amount of sunlight \rthat falls on different latitudes and in seasons. \nThe amount of sunlight received in the summer at high northern latitudes appears to be especially important \rto determine whether the Earth is in an ice age or not. \nWhen the northern summer sun is strong, the Earth tends to be in a warm period. \r\nWhen it is weak we tend to be in an ice age.\r\nAs we come out of an ice age, \nthe sea level rises about 400 feet, and we enjoy a warm period 'like' the one we are in now. That is the natural cycle, brief warm periods followed by an ice age about every 100 thousand years.\r\nThere are three general factors that determine the forcing changes in the Milankovitch cycles.\r\nEccentricity \r\n(the elliptical changes in the earth's orbit around the sun)\r\nObliquity (the tilt of Earth's axis toward and away from the sun)\r\nPrecession (the wobble of Earth's axis toward and away from the sun)\r\n.\r\nThe two terms you want to be familiar with in the Milankovitch cycles are perihelion and aphelion.\r\nThese terms pertain to proximity to, and/or climate forcing from solar energy.\r\nPerihelion \r\nis when Earth spends more time in close proximity to the sun, or in the case of the tilt and wobble cycles \r\nwhen the northern hemisphere landmass facing the sun is closest to the sun, causing warming.\r\nAphelion \r\nis the opposite, when the Earth spends more time during the year away from the sun, \r\nor in the case of the tilt and wobble cycles when the northern hemisphere landmass facing the sun is \r\nfurther from the sun, causing cooling.\r\nThe Eccentricity Cycle (Elliptical Cycle)\r\n.\r\nThis is the longer cycle. \r\nAbout every 100k years. \r\nWhen the Earth orbit is elliptical we spend less time \r\nclose to the sun in the span of a single year. \r\nThis means we get less solar energy on an annual basis and tend to cool the Earth.\r\n.\r\nAccording to Ralph Keeling, Director of the CO2 program at Scripps Institute of Oceanography:\r\n“The ice sheets melt when the ice sheet is exposed to more summer sunlight. \r\nThis happens when the northern summer aligns with the point of the closest approach between the earth and the sun. \r\nThe point of closest approach is known as perihelion. The earth/sun perihelion depends on how elliptical the orbit is. \r\nThe more elliptical, the closer the approach.”\r\n.\r\nThe Obliquity Cycle (Axial Tilt)\r\nThe Axial Tilt, or obliquity, varies to the plane of the Earth's orbit. \r\nThis tilt, \r\ntypically around 23 1/2 degrees can vary between 22 and 24 1/2 degrees. \r\nThat means it can change up to 2.5 degrees over a period of 41,000 years. \r\nIncreased obliquity can cause summers to be warmer and winters to be colder.\r\nSo when our orbit is elliptical and our northern hemisphere, \r\nwhich is mostly landmass is tilted toward the sun, we can melt our way out of an ice age\r\n pretty fast in fact it only takes a few thousand years.\r\nAs we attain a more circular orbit and the combined effects of the tilt and \r\nwobble work together in their natural cycles the Earth has a chance to cool again and we go back into an ice age.\r\n.\r\nInversely, \r\ndecreased obliquity can cause cooler summers that in combination with other factors can help push the climate system into ice ages when this cycle is favorable for that condition.\r\n******* We are currently in a decreasing phase, \r\nwhich under normal circumstances, \r\nwithout the excess GHG’s, would cool the climate system.\r\n.\r\nThe Precession Cycle (Wobble)\r\nNext is precession, or wobble.\r\nThis cycle occurs every 26,000 years. This gyroscopic wobble of the earth's axis is driven by tidal forces which are influenced by our sun and moon. The Earth is actually not perfectly round so the gravitational pull tugs the axis over time creating the wobble cycle. \n.\r\nNow there's a technical term for you.\r\nThis wobble can cause a difference in the types of seasons one polar hemisphere will experience over the other. \r\nThe hemisphere at perihelion (closest to the sun) will enjoy an increase in summer solar radiation but a cooler winter, \r\nwhile the opposite hemisphere will have a warmer winter and a cooler summer.\r\nCurrently, \nthe southern hemisphere is at perihelion, so they are enjoying warmer summers, \r\nbut cooler winters, which likely contributes to snowfall in the hemisphere.\r\n.\r\nNatural Cycle Departure\r\nThe natural cycle is range bound and well understood, \r\nlargely constrained by the Milankovitch cycles. Since the beginning of the industrial age, \r\nhumankind has caused such a dramatic departure from the natural cycle, \r\nthat it is hard to imagine anyone thinking that we are still in the natural cycle.\r\n.\r\nNatural vs. Modern Forcing\r\nClimate Forcing & Temperature\r\nNatural vs. Modern Climate Path\r\nMheel Attribution Chart\r\n.\r\nThis departure is so dramatic that it has instigated a new era.\r\n.\r\nAccording to research studies, \r\nthere is enough evidence to state that we have departed the Holocene \r\nand \r\nentered the Anthropocene.\r\n*\r\n***** Simply put, \r\nbased on the evidence, mankind has forced the Earth climate system to depart from it's the MOST POWERFUL natural cycle \r\nGLACIATION!\r\n.\r\nLinks\r\nNASA Earth Observatory – Milutin Milankovitch\r\nIPCC/UCAR – What Caused the Ice Ages and Other Important Climate Changes Before the Industrial Era?\r\nNASA/NCDC/NOAA Astronomical Theory of Climate Change\r\nAGU – \"Concrete\" Testimony to Shifting Latitude of the Tropics\r\nOpen University Netherlands – Solar radiation and Milankovich\r\nUniv. of Rhode island – Milankovitch Cycles in Paleoclimate\r\nNASA Earth Observatory – Earth is Cooling…No It’s Warming\r\n.\r\nhttps://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/gov-rick-scott-bans-term-climate-change-in-florida", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Rick Kooi", "channel": "UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQjbe76VbvW2sQ1zD7rgjyuia6NKOPQelRAFeiw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Burn all waste to reclaim the energy and put the carbon back in the life cycle. Buy that big SUV you always wanted. The last two thousand years have been around 200 ppm and life has been hard. Around 300 milllion years ago it was that low because life killing events happen. You will soon find that life on earth depends on CO2 levels above 200ppm. Just before the industrial revolution, we fell to 208ppm (0.02%), and the earth went into a stage one die-off. We are in a carbon drought. In Europe, it was first discovered, the tree line was falling as the CO2 got thinner. All CO2 comes from abiotic oil (no such thing as fossil fuel). In the beginning, the amount of oil reaching the surface set the CO2 level at 4,000ppm (4%). Whole herds of animals died in the pools of oil on the surface of the earth. The 4,000ppm was the high mark at over 450 million years ago when the earth was an overgrown jungle. Oil is a geological squeeze and as the earth gets older the amount of oil coming to the surface is less and less. Oil is transformed to plant giving life CO2 by the first bacteria that ate oil and gave off CO2. This bacteria existed long before plants and is still hard at work today. O2 comes from water vapor, H2O, in the upper atmosphere broken down to O2 and H2. Our atmosphere is oil and water and does not depend on animals or plants to maintain. The earth would have died in about 200 years to 2,000 years as first, the plants died then all animals. But then came the industrial revolution and CO2 levels have come back up to over 300ppm. We are now experiencing a regreening of the earth. More CO2 means more plants with more fruit and grain and worldwide hunger has disappeared. Man is now the most important part of the earth's ecosystem. If Man dies, the earth dies about 200 years later. This is why President Trump got us out of the Paris Accord and why the socialist say we only have ten years to save the planet. The socialist are liars and we need truth and real science, not politics to save the planet. You will find this all in the news before the next election. But you know everyone in the government knows all this. The Liberals just hope we don't find out before they can get back power. Truth: Carbon dioxide is the source of all life on this planet. Putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is good for all life on this planet.

An Estimated 90% of our cities are under water. Oddly, our historic accounts give very little mention of it. I think because it is so slow. Interrupting the last 2.6 million years of ice age are warm spells that are short lived (every 100,000 years or so the spells last about 10,000 years). We are in one such spell right now.We have always been subject to climate change, just as we are right now. We fixate on the bad because it hurts, yet there are good things too. Northern latitudes up to the arctic circle become tropical, opening up fantastic amounts land for people to live on that outweighs land loss. Fresh water from rain becomes more common and better yet, the climate becomes much more stable. Almost everything flourishes in warm weather, even us. However, before we consider this too much, there is another alternative. While cast off by climate science it has not been ruled out by any means, our warm spell is scheduled to end soon (no one knows when), if scientist have concluded the wrong driver of climate, we will not see this warmer future, rather the warm spell will end and we will go back to a full ice age.

You can't cut down trees faster than the are replaced and keep it going forever. In the US, the forests are not shrinking because we cut them down and replant them as needed. So after so long learning to consume wood we realised we were running out of trees, so we switched to coal, coal is fine but not endlessly. Coal produces a lot of waste. Now we can either say that we need a mass genocide or we can do the obvious, switch to a cleaner energy source.

Mind you, nuclear power was in its stride during the cold war.\n\n\nAgain, nuclear power is awesome, but it can and has been used recklessly.

They are genuine in their expressed beliefs and want to expose the lies.\nThere are many videos of older highly acclaimed scientists exposing the alarmists. Eg Prof Ivar Giaever, Dr Don Easterbrook,  Murry Salby, Prof Ian Plimer, Prof Bob Carter, Prof Fred Singer, Prof Freeman Dyson, Prof Patrick Michaels, Prof Garth Paltridge, Dr Richard Siegmund Lindzen etc. \nOlder scientists can more easily speak their mind because they have nothing to lose w.r.t. career prospects.\n\nFor the politically aware, view the channel RockingMrE .
