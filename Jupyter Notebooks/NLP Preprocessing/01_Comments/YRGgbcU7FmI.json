{"cid": "Ugzn1Z_nXh22msb50P94AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Bad times are on us\". I would suggest to start a \"go fund me\" campaign, getting money from all the world, buy a small island and send 45 off. This would give us a chance to heal the world.\n\nPeople with a decent level of understanding and education, know that earths climate is a massively complicated process controlled by an overwhelming number of factors, with the consequience that  non-scientiests can't glimps even small parts of the system and judge them correctly.

{"cid": "Ugw-VdY-pExeVON9e014AaABAg", "text": "Trevor, is there a way to check if Michelle Obama had miscarriage or abortion.. I will leave more comment related to  healthcare on the other video.¬†\nWhat kind of check  to validate the information and claims there is that we can have as general population. Why do we trust politicians whose speeches are scripted Michelle obama admitted that she cant speak one word, make public announcement or use twitter or instagram to share her geniune thoughts..  without the other people checking on what she would be ok to say,  all her statements are being coached and heavily filtered and doctored. Plus someone fills the bill and stands behind her nomination. Who is that? Do we suddenly just get this women because she is a wife of so and so.? I say Kim Kardashian deserves to be a president more so than Michell obama.. Why do not we have Kardashian family run the country. They love black peopel, but I mean really love them literally in bed.. Unlike Michelle who ask fellow black people to go dies for her in a war. Kardashians fight as family feud - not killing each other.. but they make sure things are sorted piecefully eventually. I trust Kardashian family minus plastic surgeries with teh country than I trust Michelle Obama.¬†\nCourtney did research on nutrition - did she meet with Obama mama? How did Obama mama popped up to sell cereal and fast food? The Capitol Hill already invited Courtney to some meetings there with many people, to use her as a figure or use her public popular status or what was it was coming Obamas for thanks giving to feed people with hot meals and what they were - caned soup warmed up - Camp bell?¬† Anything that kourt would approve? the best organic items? Obama cares? caress also a word of touching someone body intimately inappropriately.  it is all too fishes,  who even came up with thsi obama cares slogan, as per Craig Ferguson kept joking CBS cares? \nSo all this glossing ever and lack of detail on what is really happening here. \nEvery single message.. and disclosure for people in position of power who set personal examples and spread propaganda via messages book publications?\nThe problem here - the type of victimhood that Michelle describes encourages females in poor countries have babies, instead of allowing abortions for free. Especially in Africa.\nThat will breed a new army of slaved- like on an African farm. Farming Free slaves soldiers  in Africa which then be sent to war, give them military salaries, since there re not jobs. They be angry uneducated hungry with high lidibo and literally. - exactly perfect nice black cutest terminator heroes to spread up those skinny russians who do not grow as big in the permanent  cold? \nThe point is that all these inaccuracies of reporting is something that you might decided to pay special attention and notE focus A/US  much on a pan with words? do u feel the difference the time of the video was an attack on trump yet inside the video there was a ,meaningful content?\nCan we convince resident does he make out of the box steps?¬†\ni suspect teh previous system was just too corrupted and it needs new r0ad.\nis there a way to check medical record that Michelle aborted the child. The point is she looks very healthy, second of all she had 2 kids, and people with miscarriages tend to have serial miscarriages. The miscarriage can be kept private also. Earlier month pf pregnancies when the egg is only a couple of months old I think miscarriages are many and not noticeable. She did not even need a special scrap out of her womb and vaginaes procedures, then it is like blowing nose in a way.. Just a bad seed, and we are a biological mass. Also abortion is not promoted  not given a free option of contraception with those females in Africa. There is much Aids.. why  not allow thsi options to people who carry no health risks - we are them into slaves, since they either being discourage to have sex or have anal sex even specifically even with women. And to have more kids - why to breed poverty - but even worst ? then how does it make sense that there would be a war? or it is ok we grow soldiers like farm animals to then use as robots to fight in war. For someone who is up in the power to get more rich, sell more military weapons, soon not only there be slaves abut there be farming people for meet/meat?\nGet Kim to run the country rather than Obama as at least Kim is open for introspection admitting to her past. What she did for publicity and what was purely an accident and had her upset truly. Etc.

So it is a vicious cycle. \nThen we separate male and kill male in war - women are more willing to promiscuous male , then we had tried ME model where a man has several wives who are respected at least and taken cares of.\nThen we start to feed kids hormone which we create some imaginary non bi nary? gender, not even based on biology?\nThen we pay so much attention to gay relation - but why - women have anal sex all the time, so why not men?  the point is that babies do not come out of the US/AS*, they come out of Africa- so it is a new model African farmed soldiers?\nPlus there is oil there that we can spend nicely on military and start over again. \nTrain serial murders?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Shawn&Inna Barrett", "channel": "UCFsON2w7CCX78ANRdsx2OTQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSvLE_epLKoa1yy4XvYGpTPvmjACIk7mT9Eon2XSw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I've heard far too many American Buddhists claim that it is. compromise has nothing to do with the middle path in Buddhism. in modern society the middle path has a become a tool for the willfully ignorant and lazy who simply don't want to say the truth about anything and need a way to seem wise.\n\nAs a sociologist i see that our culture honors what Asimov described so much, that instead of smart people bringing other's up to their level, we actually punish intelligent people and bring them down to the levels of the worst of us. it's really quite an interesting phenomena that is all pervasive down to the very core of our cultural values.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Slaves Forging", "channel": "UCt17Mn-XKTsuXU2vS9fkqcw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT3q_RHkEM_ADu-p8w3fyJB76MJQD1h3T71gUFJeA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They are a politically activist, megalomaniacal, fund sucking, global elitist, third world crushing machine that can't predict climate one decade out, much less one century. For every crack pot scientist they employ, I can find 10 reputable ones, many being Nobel prize recipients that disagree wholeheartedly. Yet the IPCC carries the narrative because they are a global entity with a platform, deep rooted agenda, and a microphone. I have seen their parametric manipulation of the mathematical modeling systems they employ to be easily biased and falsely manufactured with inconsistent sampling techniques i.e. using ships to take ocean temps from a harbor and at sea and then use the harbor temps in modeling as it fits their hyperbole at the time. By no means take my word for it Franz, all I ask is that people use critical thinking, research, and common sense to come to their own conclusions.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Bagrilla Jenkins", "channel": "UC9OLsekfW7jAhF-fd9OX_mQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQwX8sAJ8zT-M2QLJ_UBvFnhOoklXgfNrLsnA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This happens when the ice that covers the arctic is reduced in size, creating more open water and more evapotranspiration (you see the same thing with the Great Lakes and the Lake Effect). The warmer the arctic becomes, the more sea ice decreases, reducing the reflective properties of the sea ice and replacing it with open water, which has a dark surface that in turn absorbs more heat from the atmosphere, making the water warmer (what we scientists call a negative feedback loop). The increased evapotranspiration alters jetstreams, which dip further south, bringing increased cold from the arctic to lower latitudes during the winter. There are two things that will alter with a changing climate: temperature and precipitation. Places like the Southwestern US will get hotter and drier (already see those trends in that region for the last 3 decades), whereas the Southern Appalachian Mountains will get hotter and wetter. Places in the Northeastern and the UK will be experiencing effects of arctic amplification and therefore will get colder winters.  Not all places will get hotter and drier. Some will get colder and wetter, some colder and drier, and some hotter and wetter. Climate is complex. Please look at the most recent IPCC report or our own government's Climate Assessment if you really want to understand the mechanisms and impacts of climate change .

I knew about the solar minimum long before it was ever in the news, but the sun cooling the Earth only makes the situation more drastic. We have an Earth heating up and melting from rising temperatures caused here, while at the same time you have a sun decreasing that temperature. As you know, the cycles of the year change depending on how direct the sun's rays are on your area of the world. This is why when the sun hits the planet directly (aka summer) the rising temperatures take over, making hot humid conditions. When the sun is not directly striking an area (aka winter) it is severely cold.\n\nNow take a look at spring and fall, the temperate seasons in temperate areas of the world. Since people seem unable to discern who to trust, then start using your ow eyes. In my own area of world, these seasons have gone from being temperate to hot and humid. There is no such thing as a cool moderate fall or spring anymore. So clearly, even with the minimum, it is not enough to overcome the heat we are causing, as the temperate seasons now favor heat, not cold.\n\nMoreover, the crops that depend on these conditions are failing. I have watched with my own eyes the decline of the fields around me. The last 2 years have been the absolute worst, and if too many more continue like this then the grain and meat industry will be in serious trouble. Even the modified seed is struggling, but don't take my word for it, or anyone else's, go do your own research. Go ask a farmer how well his crops have been growing.

They simply cannot grow. Like I said, go ask a farmer how well the crops have been. Crops don't grow well in swamp-like conditions. Think of how many farm industries you can name that are growing in swamps.  \n2) Agriculturally speaking, cold is easier to combat than a swamp. So if you have to choose one, go with the lesser of the two evils.\n\nI know that a lot of the people commenting on here have said that it isn't that they deny climate change is happening, but that they deny it is manmade. My response to that is, if we both think we are right, why not let science test both theories? Let's make the changes that we are told will make things better and see what happens. What negative consequences do you foresee that will outweigh giving the opposite side equal time to prove who is right? \n\nMy guess is that you are thinking tax dollars, and you believe that these changes would be more expensive than the results they would show. However, in a country struggling to create jobs, isn't a new industry that would need more people to help implement this new idea a good thing? The technology needed to make changes is more likely to create rather than destroy incomes. Think of the American construction of highways and electric lines in the 30s and 40s.

Yes, I hate Trump with the passion of a thousand burning suns.  If you are a fiscal conservative, you hate him because he's doubled the deficit in less than two years, to over $1 trillion according to CBO projections.  Not to mention the wasteful corrupt spending by his cronies in the cabinet.  \n\nIf you are an advocate of capitalism, you hate him for artificially propping up the market with vast amounts of government spending, creating a market bubble that will pop sooner rather than later.  You also hate the blatant market interference created by him using twitter to punish companies that he doesn't like.  \n\nIf you support the Free Market, then you hate him for pushing job-killing tariffs that has cost our economy billions more than we got in tax cuts and has led to more government spending to prop up failing businesses (like $12 billion for farmers hit hard by tariffs), all for a trade war that will likely end like all trade wars in history have- with both sides stepping back and returning to the status quo, no winner, no victory, just economic devastation.  \n\nIf you are a conservative that supports the Rule of Law, you hate him for violating our  presidential norms by refusing to divest his businesses and using tax payer money to stuff his pockets every time he goes golfing; his protecting blatantly corrupt members of his cabinet; and for breaking Nepotism laws by hiring his daughter and son-in-law to work in the White House (and yes, I know the DOJ says it's not illegal now, but they said it was illegal in every other single administration after the laws were passed until DJT's personal minions took over the DOJ; so why the change now?)\n\nIf you support American leadership in the world, then you absolutely hate the mockery he's made of the US globally, by breaking treaties with our allies and supporting our enemies.  I understand real politic, but North Korea and Russia are not our friends, we can't trust them like Trump so blindly [and obviously] does.  \n\nAnd yes, I'm socially moderate, so I could go on for several more hours on that front.

The division, since his inauguration, has been extreme, and I think it's time for us to come together as a nation, and get rid of this huge mistake by the electoral college, due to gerrymandering.  In MI, there were more votes for Clinton, but because of gerrymandering, it appeared as though more voted for trump, which is false.

What motivation do scientists have for lying about global warming being real? They lose out on that corporate money, and most climatologists aren't paid that well. Believe me, most of them wish global warming wasn't real, but they feel they have a duty to warn the public. Conservatives act is if global warming is all that justifies the existence of climatologists. Even if global warming wasn't real, we would still need people to monitor and study the climate. Climates change over time; wind patterns change, the amount of precipitation in different areas change, the Earth is even getting closer to the Sun. The climate has a huge economic impact, it can cause natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, wild fires), lead to fires breaking out at oil refineries or other chemical plants, to health impacts (heat stroke, spread of tropical diseases), to making people late for work because they are driving through a storm, to name a few things.

The oceans aren't heating up faster as a result of global warming, rather; the heating up of the oceans IS WHAT'S CAUSING IT. \n\nLarge bodies of water heat up very slowly, moving large bodies of water even slower still, even if the average air temperature was 10-15 degrees (F) higher than it is - this wouldn't be enough to cause the kind of spikes in ocean temperature that is happening all around. The reason why the temperature of the ocean is so critical has to do with cloud cover which is a major factor in how much heat gets trapped close to the surface of the earth. \n\nIt seems to me that the main take away from forwarding an agenda that says humanity can do something to save the day is to \n1] First and foremost to give people hope that something can be done - right up until the last moment  - this will hopefully prevent mass hysteria and pandemonium...I understand that messages like mine are a bit alarmist and counterproductive when considered in this light, but it's far better that people consider this and get ahead of it rather than find out at the last minute when shit WILL REALLY be bad because of the perceived betrayal whilst civilization as we know it is about to die with those few million remaining pointing fingers at each other saying you didn't do enough...\n\n2] The second is the more nefarious idea that profit and power can be made off of manipulating the political/economic machinations of a society all too reliant on dino power in hopes that people will just make the planet a nicer place to live in before we all die...\n\nEither way, we're fucked.

We don't get spring or fall weather anymore, just extreme heat, extreme cold, and a whole lot of soggy soggy weather.  So many plants, native and cultivated, are struggling.  Even the gmo crops are struggling, and they were designed to withstand extreme conditions.  \n\nWhen I was a kid we had 3 hard winter months with lots of snow and ice (December, January, February), then March was soggy and cold, then April was cool (in the 50+ degree range but beautiful sunny spring weather. May continued much the same way, gradually warming to the 60s, until around the 25th of the month, it seemed to heat up to the 70s.  June was beautiful and green, staying in the 70s, until around the 27th of the month, then the July heat kicked in.  July and August were miserable months, especially August, which could get to the 100s, and July was full of terrible thunderstorms.  Then September started to cool to the 70s, with a potential frost by the end of the month.  October was cold, sunny, and full of fall color, maybe a rainy day here or there.  November was gray, no leaves, and cold.  All this led us back to the last week of November, when the snow would start to fall, and there was always snow for Christmas.  If you look at some anecdotes from history, this was normal Ohio weather.  There was even an expression, \"Don't like Ohio weather? Just wait, it'll change.\"  We had every kind of weather for every kind of person.  Now all we get is muggy, wet, heat, and occasional bouts of bitter, biter cold.\n\nThe first time I saw this crap was in 1998.  We got a reprieve for a few years, from about 2006-2012, but now it's been getting even worse than before.

He‚Äôs entitled to his opinion, yes, but his opinion should not be considered equal to the data being studied and reported on by actual scientists.\n\nI don‚Äôt adhere to the ‚Äústay in your lane‚Äù ideology.

The fact that the states...many of which are larger than some countries...are spread out over thousands of miles.....and our light rail/train systems are SO inferior, compared to some other countries, that this mode is not really an option for many of us. Add to that having an occupation that requires you to haul equipment or instruments...which makes having a personal vehicle pretty essential.\n\nThat said......I find it appalling that American auto makers, in particular, have been in bed with the oil industry for decades...to ensure that \"consumers\" have virtually no options when it comes to owning a truly fuel-efficient and non-polluting automobile. I recently bought a 2007 Honda CR-V...a decent car, but with a totally unacceptable 24 MPG average....4 MPG LESS than the falling-apart 2001 Nissan Frontier I traded in. Had price not been the primary deciding factor, you can be sure I would have opted for a much more fuel-efficient vehicle. Unfortunately, finding that in my price range is a near impossibility.....and probably quite intentional manipulation by auto makers and their co-conspirators, Big Oil.\n\nI carpool and find alternatives, when possible...but as long as the two industries are allowed to control the narrative and control the product (and the pricing), those of us who cannot afford the hybrids and electric cars currently on the market will have little choice but to continue adding to the problem.

They don't understand what it means and they're just following the title. Bad title given to an unknowledgable public is always going to end badly.  It's the same argument as \"if monkeys evolved into people, why are there still monkeys?\". Because monkeys didn't turn into people, it's a shared ancestry. But once again, media headlines overly dumbed it down so people who don't know the science are making the only logical conclusion they can with what information they were given. And they really do this with everything, not just big topic issues.\n\nOf course, even if I do sit here grumbling at the media for over simplifying it, the blame is not entirely theirs. There is something very wrong in a country where something as concrete as tested and retested scientific evidence is seen as a damned political stance. How does that make any sense? Climate change is not an opinion, it's not a left vs right or liberal vs conservative issue. So why are we pretending it is?

For example, a decrease in solar activity is thought to have triggered the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland was largely cut off by ice from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.\n\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the sun:\n\nSince 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased slightly.\n\nIf the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.\n\nClimate models that include solar irradiance changes can‚Äôt reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.\n\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/causes/\n\nThey disagree with you.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Jerrell Bevers", "channel": "UC_WO3XE-mXChbQx53tIu0zA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSSJv9VBYeE-yUXWycD60yxO2Nfwh0AkfZ0Z7k3gw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

All the global warming stats go back a hundred years, the solar cycle stats go back hundreds of years. I'm going to put my money in long-term history rather than short-term history. Maybe if the Industrial Revolution would have happened 200 years earlier I would be seriously concerned with global warming AKA climate change AKA greenhouse effect. But at this point I'm more worried about food shortages due to longer Winters colder Winters and the equator being the only habitable zone for a few hundred years. Our magnetosphere is declining at the current rate that our son is losing solar activity. Connect the dots man. I think the main difference between global cooling or GSM and climate change or global warming is that we are not trying to fear Monger that the seas are going to rise and all these people are going to be wiped out because actually if it cools there's going to be more ice and the more ice is going to reflect more sunlight and radiation was cool this even more not to mention that the sun is going into a minimum and it's not going to be as active so it's not putting out the same. And I really don't understand why you climate change Advocates would be against people that advocate for GSM just because it is not a warming it is a cooling it is still technically climate change it is just cooling not warming. You guys need the band with us no matter how different the end result may be we are still trying to do the same thing we are still trying to cut emissions we are still trying to reduce our human footprint we're still trying to do all the beneficial things that you guys are trying to do we just have a different mindset and a different idea of what the end result will be. Yet again this is exactly the example of what is wrong with this country and this world is that they put others on the outside which then they can demon eyes from their little clique and call them conspiracy theorist or crazies or whatever where is we're trying to do the same thing. If you try to feed a dog with the only thing you have which is dog food, and I try to feed a dog with the only thing I have which is cat food, is that necessarily bad or we still trying to feed the dog and make sure the dog is healthy?

People buy what's cheaper, even if it's also the right thing to do. The crazy thing is that about 50% of that change was created by one man, Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX, etc.).

People a long time ago worried that humanity was facing a similar problem, in that population was growing so fast that we could not grow enough food to feed every one, and that would bring about starvation, war, economic collapse, etc. However, shortly thereafter, the agricultural revolution happened. I remember watching this video about previous examples of when scientists and intellectuals thought \"the world would end\", and how all of those cases were averted by technology solving the problem. Even now, people are coming up with solutions to solve the floating trash island, for instance.  I think it is a total possibility that some genius will come up with a technological solution to the problem, but I also don't want to let that make us become complacent, because then it won't happen. It is a serious problem that demands our attention, but I also don't rule out the idea that some tech genius can come up with a solution to solve the problem either. In other words, we should do what we can to combat the problem now, but we also shouldn't commit suicide because we are all doomed.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "quantumperception", "channel": "UCEadZsGBKj1MPOZljpj5p1A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR6Zdrzsp15k4DlnPqSPGTjYTuufOAhLoy0ppK-=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Journalists love to claim that real journalism is about being \"objective\" but \"presenting both sides\" isn't \"objectivity\" it is \"neutrality\". Now, it is great if on any given topic all sides stick to facts, base their claims & views on reality, etc... because this allows both objectivity & neutrality. However, if it is raining outside & 2 people step outside then come back in to give their views on what the weather outside is & 1 of them says it is raining while the other one says it is sunny allowing them both to present their side/view of the question is neutral, it is in fact the opposite of objective. People can have all sorts of views, opinions, etc... on the same topic while they all also deal in facts. But, any organization supposedly engaged in real journalism not only has the choice, but they have the obligation to not allow any side on any topic the opportunity to present \"their side\" when they reject facts & lie.\n\n2) CNN is not \"damned if you do, damned if you don't.\" Republicans/Conservatives have constantly complained about the \"liberal media\" [non-existant in major, mainstream journalism organizations unless by 'liberal' people mean someone who isn't a complete bigoted as-hole & believes everyone has a right to some very limited, minimal amount decency in how they are treated... then yeah these organizations are 'liberal' but so is the vast majority of the planet.] They continue to complain about it, & guess what they will continue complaining about not matter how f-cking far backwards organizations go to allow Republican/Conservative propagandists the ability to present \"their side\" of things. However, Democrats [or even for that matter people actually on the left side of the political spectrum,] will not be constantly complaining about stuff these organizations do if they stop allowing blatant & obvious liars to spread lies, especially not the Democrats. The people on the left would still have some complaints about the way a small number of topics are covered, but trust me we don't expect any of them to cover those specific topics any differently & will not be making any public fuss about it just grumbles amongst ourselves.\n\nThe way they operate now they catch flak from all sides, participate in spreading lies, & completely violate the 1 supposed aspiration of their profession. They have the ability to actually try to live up to their self-professed ideals & stop the legitimate flak being hurled their direction. The idea that views, beliefs, etc... which are blatant & obvious lies/falsehoods is somehow legitimate simply because 1 of the 2 major political parties in our country & roughly a little less than 50% of the population choose to believe it [for the voters at least...

Melting Ice shelfs and volcanoes becoming active are byproducts of that. warmer water also contributes to warmer air evaporating into the weather system disrupts normal weather patterns increasing the frequency of erratic storm systems.

The point at which I disagree with you is the time period over which they have taken place. Show to me at any point in history where the ppm of CO2 has risen at the rate that it has over the period since the industrial age. I think you will find that you won't find much at all data because the increase of CO2 particles in the atmosphere has changed over hundreds of thousands of years, not a few decades. Over the past 400 thousand years, approximately the amount of time that the genus Homo Sapiens has existed on this planet, the highest CO2 concentration was approximately 280 ppm but in the time since the 1800s the carbon dioxide concentration in our atmosphere has increased from 250ppm to well past over 400ppm. YES, the CO2 concentration was higher during the existence of the dinosaurs but we never evolved to survive those levels of CO2 in our atmosphere because we have never been exposed to them before. It can't just be a simple coincidence that our use, as a species, of petroleum-based energy since the beginning of the 1800s has coincided with the fastest growth of CO2 in our atmosphere, in not just recorded history but the past 60 million years.

However where I disagree is that this is 100% proof. There are spikes on co2 charts taken from antartic ice cores that dwarf what we are seeing, or are projected to see. So my point is that maybe just maybe there could be an outcome that would have happened reguardless of our presence. Indifferent of that fact, i state to you and all climate change activist to present a solution to your problem that doesnt send us to pre industrial era, and doesn't put the global economy on the rocks.  More improtantly one that will send us into an even larger, but cleaner technological revolution. That i can support, but for anyone to tell me I have to change my carbon emissions (or be taxed for them!)or drive electric vehicles that cause more harm than good and run off of coal powered electricity I cannot support. Even elon musk has stated that tesla has problems building and mataining efficiency in thier batteries, and is incredibly expensive to attatain these resources, and because of so he has borrowed tax payer money.

The large majority of northern Europe survives on renewable fuels such as Hyrdo power, wind and some even use hydrothermal as a form of energy generator, though it is much less normal. Things such as solar power are impractical to power a country but to power individual cities and houses it is completely feasible. I would also have to agree to change my original statement that there is 100% proof but there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt at this current point that it is happening and that we need to do something about it.

Not the MSM, because how would they profit from increased taxes? No one involved in pushing the agenda would benefit from the increased taxes because you know they would go towards building shit.\n Thirdly again back to the scientist, are they being payed off to push this agenda? If so by whom?\n Fourthly what parts of man made climate change are you sceptical of? The enormous amount of CO2 we've introduced? You seem to recognize CO2 increases cause global warming since you brought up that point about how CO2 levels in Ice cores so it's probably not that part and I just can't think of another reason other than those two to doubt it so I feel like to convince you I need to know what parts of man made global warming you aren't buying.\n Sixthly you are right that currently measures taken to decrease our impact on global warming, ie. Building Wind/solar farms,  contribute to the amount of CO2 in the air which is why it's so important we get it over with now while we still have some room in the carbon budget to spare because once the means of manufacturing, and the means of extracting and transporting resources as well as power production don't produce CO2 you can produce things without adding CO2 and every step along the way to that end produces less carbon than the former.\nFiinally global warming happened in the past is not a counter to we are causing global warming because of the fact that we can have an impact on the same factors that caused global warming in the past.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Jonathon Hardee", "channel": "UCBRblaJjXrqpPZ1U9NXiUaA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQLX8GoBqD0Vxm-t_zYhXck7HuiJ7rpS_0KcBiQMw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxKkWrvmr-CJNGrrDh4AaABAg", "text": "Trump doesn't believe in climate change - or at the very least doesn't like the concept of \"climate change\" - because a) he's a moron who hasn't been in school in 50 or so years and therefore just doesn't believe modern science and b) government regulations put in place to curb climate change can cost wealthy corporations lots of money. He put stooges like former EPA chief Scott Pruitt into prominent positions within his administration to ease or completely remove regulations so corporations can spend less money (and therefore pocket that money) on things like environmentally safe disposal of waste and the limiting of emissions. So when Trump proudly spouts on about how he's rolling back government regulations, that's what he s talking about. But people just cheer and clap along because it sounds great to have less government meddling in our lives, not realizing that the regulations he's rolling back are letting more and more companies pour more poison into our land, seas, and air. Trump sees environmental regulations as roadblocks preventing profits, and he emphasizes the economy above all of his other \"achievements\". He brags about how well the economy is doing under his administration, because that's a major selling point to get re-elected, the environment be damned. But when the climate becomes too harsh for most people - i.e. poor people - to live comfortably, he and his brood, along with all the wealthy people who have profitted the most from the way things have been, just won't care at all. They'll just use their wealth to buy boats they can live on while everyone else drowns, or build a space station in orbit like the movie Elysium while we all suffocate.

But of already decades and even thousands of years of data taken from studying the past (studying the ice samples from Antarctica) says that the temperature of the planet is warming up (to clarify, that is the average temperature of all the data compiled in the planet per year). This means, some places are getting colder (not the poles since they are melting so fast that if it was a race, every year a speed record would be broken), and some places are getting hotter, Thus the definition of climate change, but the average of these temperatures all together for the year is warmer (because people couldn't understand global warming we now use climate change).\n\nNow since the average person understands this and there are still those that refuses the data, the facts, the evidence... What does that mean? What does it mean if your fuel tank indicator says your car is going empty and you refuse to acknowledge the reading? Do you keep driving until it is too late to fill it at a gas station or do you fill it? You get a fever and the doctor tells you that you are sick, you need rest, medication, and proper food... Will you just refuse the diagnosis and do whatever you want and die, or do you take the ttreatmen? The planet is telling you that it can't take the crap any more. Earth will still be there but we might find it difficult to cope with the changes once the lakes go dry, once the lands get flooded, once the weather hazards get stronger, etc. Not only will our own homes be affected but our source of food will disappear. Farms, fish, conditions for growing plants and for animals to survive (our food) will be affected. And yet, the diagnosis, the meter indication, the data, the facts, the evidence... Is being ignored, but by who? Who is ignoring or wishes to ignore it? Why are they ignoring it? If you ask me... Fossil fuel, the companies that use it, the companies that extract it from the planet, not people that drive cars, no.

The reason behind your beliefs is evident by your statements, references,  and blind allegiances. You may not be aware of the composition of the IPCC in terms of it's allegiances. Let me assure you there is no nobility in deriding dissenting evidence as heresy.   The budget for climate study has grown from 70 million to 1.5 trillion in two decades. Why? The global temperature went up about 1 degree in 150 years and according to IPCC modeling 30 years ago it should have increased 3-5 degrees. Why hasn't it? They said that by now snow would be a thing of the past. Is it? Are you aware that while your country is warming, the southern hemisphere is cooling? Do you know the composition of greenhouse gases? 95% of the gases are water vapor. In the atmosphere CO2 makes up 0.04%. Anthropogenic activity accounts for one third of the CO2. That's 0.013%. Rather minuscule in comparison to nitrogen, oxygen, argon wouldn't you say? Why is the troposphere not warming if that's where the greenhouse gases collect? Why did global temperature decrease during the industrial age(1940-1975)? Why did the IPCC change/omit scientific contributions in response to comments by individual governments and NGO's? I am aware the globe is warming. I am aware climate changes. I refute the level of human involvement claims to be crisis level. It is moderate at best, more so rather insignificant.

I'm a plant molecular biologist, and there are tons of things we could do right now to help lots of people and the environment, but we're 'not allowed to', because 'people' don't want us to.\nThere are 2 kinds of stupidity, 'Physiological', where somebody literally can't understand things, and 'Optional', where somebody chooses to embrace ignorance and irresponsible decisions even though they're perfectly capable of understanding the issues.\nFor physiological stupidity, we should try to find better ways to teach and explain things, and put some (though not limitless) effort into helping those who are struggling.\nFor optional stupidity, somebody has to choose to 'cure' themself, nobody else can 'cure' them while they remain alive.\nUnder certain conditions, optional stupidity ceases to be merely annoying, and poses a threat to many other people besides the person who is choosing to be ignorant, dishonest, and irresponsible. Under those conditions, clearly intervention is necessary, and ideally, you can just pass laws that forbid willfully destructive behavior, and destructive actions can be treated just like any other crime. Unfortunately, in our system, for this issue, the people who are choosing to be stupid are often in charge, and even when people who aren't stupid get in power, they act like cowards, refusing to stand up for what is right, or exercise their power responsibly.\n\nMy hands are not completely clean. I have burned fossil fuel in my life, and while I actively try to avoid doing so, I have in some ways contributed to this problem. However, when given feasible choices, I will go out of my way to mitigate the impacts I have on the environment, and so should everyone else. We all bare responsibility in this, but we've made enough excuses, we've wasted enough time, and we've let liars and thieves steer us in a terrible direction for long enough. There are things we can do to at least slow this disaster down, and surrendering to those acting in bad faith is not only cowardice, but a betrayal of our responsibilities.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "darknightoftroy", "channel": "UCGEj8if060uUKJYcI3B7MNA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRdWVswTx-KPwBCQ7wZasCweBSaWchtsZ1edE9B=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It even matches your own criteria: actual scientists, not bureaucrats, celebrities, journalists or politicians.\n\nHow about this one, for example?\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nature02121\nA publication in Nature, the world's most well-known scientific journal and the holy grail of any scientist; allowing only the best of the best.\n\nExcept that's not why you're here. You care not for the validity of information, you're merely using the issue of climate change as fuel for your own Dunning-Kruger ailment, aren't you?\nWhat other excuse could you have for not once bothering to investigate what the actual scientific community has to say, and deciding frankly astoundingly that you somehow know better than all of them?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "The White Guardian", "channel": "UCW1h_DsZIiE62uCRzv-fp9Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR84VvkVfqh0Ft4_nGbVup64wJWWVskeqoVZV8F=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

He doesn't understand anything outside of that frame, so it's natural for him to make it adversarial and claim the scientists are his enemy and their motivation is money and relevance. The real problem is that Trump is a 70 year old narcissist and he has no reason to care about the state of the Earth 20 years from now, maybe even less.

Personally, up until I transferred out of my shitty public school, I had a difficult time understanding what critical thinking even was, let alone how to do it. Like, when I was given my first critical thinking  question in the 4th grade, I couldn't even process it.\n\n\"How do I do this question? We haven't learned the process behind how rain clouds form. How am I supposed to tell you how it works if I haven't been taught how it works yet?\"\n\nI was told to think for myself and I could not even. My mind went blank on that, and I basically just made something up that kinda made sense to me (I don't remember what I answered, something about geysers spewing water into the air or something.)\n\nWhen I found out I was wrong, I got upset because I felt like I was set up to fail, and I was going to get points deducted for a question I wasn't taught the answer to yet. And when the teacher explained that it didn't matter if I got it right, because whether or not I was correct wasn't the point of the question, it was to get me to try and formulate my own ideas and opinions based on what little I know to get my own answer. And my mind was fucking blown. When I had doubts about how this could help me on tests and assignments, I was about to snap at the teacher about it. \n\nBut then I realized, \"Wait, if I don't know or forget the answer to a question, I could use this to relearn the answer on my own. HOLY SHIT, WHY WASN'T I TAUGHT THIS SHIT SOONER???????\"\n\nI had gone entire school years up until that point without having to answer critical thinking questions. It wasn't because weren't any (there were indeed 'critical thinking's questions in our textbooks), it because in every class I'd been in growing up WE WERE BEING TOLD TO SKIP THEM.\n\nI cringe whenever I think about how lazy brained I was essentially taught to be (and still am at times).

Gradual changes over the course of years to decades of human activity from that scope still doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be able to have an impact. \nIts when you realize or understand that the earth is a closed and finite system that it becomes easier to understand how humans could have an impact. From the standpoint of pollutants (including greenhouse gasses and co2 specifically) the earth is like a bucket with a hole in the bottom. Pollutants are like filling it up with water and nature can eliminate it at a set rate, the hole. But human actions contribute to these factors, heavy pollution due to burning fossil fuels increases the flow into the bucket, while deforestation can shrink the hole at the bottom. When you put more in than can drain out, its only inevitable that it would overflow or spill. The trick to climate science is finding out the rate of filling of that bucket, and what signs of eventually spilling or tipping over will look like.\n\n\nTldr: Most people think of the earth as an infinite expanse where it‚Äôs actually more finite than they think.

What we want is:\n A: to see if you can grasp the idea that multiple factors affect the climate, Its not an \"either, or\" situation.\n B: quatify the forcing by sunspot cycles and compare it with CO2 forcing.\n C: present that peer-reviewed study that says there would be a drop in temperature of 45¬∫f (A drop bigger by far than anything that this planet ever experienced in 500 million years, last glacial period we had a drop of 10¬∫f compared to current interglacial so how does that work? If its cyclical then why is this cycle has much higher fluctuation than anything that happened in the last 500 million years? The biggest mass extinction (permian-triassic) saw an incredible rise in temperatures of 25¬∫f in 20.000 years. It killed more than the asteroid that wiped out the dinossaurs. You don't understand what a drop of 45¬∫f would do to us. It would be game over. Human extinction and possibly all multicelular life extinction. So if it is a cycle when was the last time there was a  fluctiation in the earths average temperatures of 45¬∫f in the last 500 million years?

If it were they would reasonably rely upon the scientific data that suggest that vaccines are safe for the overwhelming majority of people, there is no valid scientific evidence that suggests that any vaccines cause autism, scientists and doctors have tried to identify groups of people for whom a certain vaccine is unsafe, doctors don't administer vaccines to members of groups who are at particular risk from a particular vaccine, herd immunity protects those who are unable to take a vaccine for medical reasons, etc.\n\nIncidentally, I was one of those people who were at risk of viral infection for the past 9 months. I had a stem cell transplant to treat cancer, and my immune system had to essentially start over from scratch.

Useless,  and if that's how y'all want to be then fine, someone else will be productive but don't sit here and complain on the internet and then get mad at me when I say something positive. No wonder why Republicans capitalize on your whinny behaviors calling you cry babies...  Oh and if you want that to stop for the sake of the Democratic name, I'd get a grip and grow up, and as you can see I was being nice about it initially but I guess people love taking niceness for a weakness and then they like taking their shots, huh?\n\nEdit:  Haha..

For example, him wanting to build a wall and make it hard for immigrants to immigrate is based on selfish reasoning; America first and always first, who cares if there's a families struggling in other countries, if you don't qualify to be an American citizen and gain citizenship then too bad but Trump wants to hold immigration to strict standards because we don't want people from the outside messing things up. Open borders doesn't always lead to good things, especially for the places that immigrants are flocking to, like France, Ireland, or Spain, who are currently having problems because of immigration, but on the non-selfish side of things would be well...  America may or may not suffer if we ever did have open borders but there would still be a place for families that want to have the American Dream and if that means risking our own country then to hell with it; let's help the people out. \n\nThat's basically the two sides in my view and Trump, he's a strong patriot, enough to were he's selfish about America and he's overly strict on outsiders.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Quantum G", "channel": "UCLHxzs978D7OUzLGK02Djlg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/lZIJqxdOSKPG96PvaY58H79Or5yTNywtN2fhrv4L1ggUre2fcmzEOConZDlJG-SB2vhVXBwdNX4=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
