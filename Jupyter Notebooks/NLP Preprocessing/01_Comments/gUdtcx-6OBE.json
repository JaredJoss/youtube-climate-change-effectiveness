The amount of warming CO2 produces (apparently some) is not precisely known. The role of the sun and how it warms the planet is not well understood either (probably something to do with cosmic rays, and their effect on clouds). This isn't something I know, of course, but I take my science opinions from people I deem experts (there is no other option), and Freeman Dyson (RIP) looks like a reliable expert... not worried about his job, not worried about money personally or funding for his department, not likely susceptible to peer pressure, and also someone capable of understanding all the science of CO2 and claims of experts in the quasi-science of climate prediction. Those are his opinions. I wonder why the tens of thousands of admittedly lesser scientists form opinions contrary to such an expert who was, when he died, the foremost physicist in the world and someone known for his imagination and the breadth and depth of his knowledge of the physical world.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Appleblade", "channel": "UCTcMoL4MFqfirx2BeUCekPQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTO71lxFQ36PrS9VgKYOilSEaqjYQQMmnq-CnZ4=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Consequently, once this cycle reached a certain zenith, the bridge became impassable to all but the toughest and luckiest critters millions of years before the collapse.\nBut the important thing is that the bit of continental shelf that remained continued to channel warm water and air to the Southern Continent, which in turn kept the 41,000 year climate swings of the planet even between North and South poles, same as they had always been, excepting for very gradual slowing of the earth’s rotation. \nThat changed VERY suddenly 19,400,000 years ago. \nThe part of the Isthmus that could have even theoretically been crossed on foot had been so worn down as to sink beneath the waves, but an INCREASINGLY sheer wall of rock still arose up miles above the abyssal plain, 100 feet or less beneath the waves, still channeling the warm jet stream that 95%of life in Antarctica still depended on. \nThen, perhaps an Big earthquake caused several miles of the wall to collapse all at once along its thinnest part, and this caused the jet stream to immediately be redirected around the new Tasmanian peninsula into South Western Australia waters, which had been cool and temperate up to then, which no doubt had a sudden negative impact there as well.\nBut that’s small potatoes compared to the devastation the sudden loss of the last trickle of warm water had in Antarctica.\nLess then a year later, 80% of all plant and animal life had frozen solid. Perhaps some REALLY hardy scavengers lingered on the frozen carcasses of all other creatures for a few more years. But if this had happened in just the last 100,000 years, we would have found vast frozen dead forests, perfectly preserved as they were in the last weeks of their lives. \nPerfectly preserved as the plants and pond animals in that highland valley still are. \nHowever, glaciers have since erased all other evidence of that world.\nIf Antarctica were to thaw, it would become like Michigan on steroids, the Land of a Million Lakes, with enough sand to build a full scale sandcastle for everyone on earth.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Elder Millennial", "channel": "UC2Gl825xGsgQa4GvWNmTcGQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ74XB0Ez8Kb43ztcM5qV205KzKwtTHNVaPaUkM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What have we got to lose, and everything to gain, by bringing their terracidal behavior to heel?\n90% of all plastic in the ocean comes from 8 Chinese rivers and 2 African rivers. America contributes maybe 2%. \nThey wiped out their native honey bees throughout their southeast through sheer bureaucratic stupidity, and farmers have to pollinate their crops BY HAND.\nBut what SHOULD be making your blood run cold with rage and terror is that China has between 2,000-5,000 new deep seam coal fires burning out of control since 1950, because they simply have no genuine consistent safety Standards. America has had only 5 new ones in that time, and 4 were from old abandoned, poorly sealed mines that some idiots caused by playing with fire near the entrances.\nOnly ONE of ours has been caused by workplace incompetence. \nNow, there’s a rare naturally occurring deep seam coal fire in Australia that was probably caused by erosion and a lightning strike. It’s been estimated to have been burning for 6,000 years. \nThere is no known way to stop these fires, and they just keep pumping carbon into the air LONG after locals stop using coal. \nWhat are you prepared to do to stop this from getting worse?", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Elder Millennial", "channel": "UC2Gl825xGsgQa4GvWNmTcGQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ74XB0Ez8Kb43ztcM5qV205KzKwtTHNVaPaUkM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So . . . climate change that started with the melting of the northern ice sheets producing mega-floods accompanied by massive flora fires and sea level rise of 130 meters {wiping out the coastal graze} and 1,300 years of winter. By the time the warming trend could pick back up, mega-fauna populations would have been crashed below the level of viability. The last of the mammoths died out around four thousand years ago. While humans 'could' and do wipe specie from existence, it would have been impossible for us to have wiped every specie over 40 kilos from the western hemisphere and northern Europe at the same time.\n\n\nI might point out that the Milanković cycle is still theory, and one that has many issues with observations.

{"cid": "UgxFSkkWXdbbAT3WGVx4AaABAg", "text": "Talks about how human activities might impact the cycles as if we're going to be around in another 74,000 years when the next peak would be expected***\nHA! That's rich. We've had factories and railway travel for less than 200 years and we're already putting ourselves at extreme risk by destroying the environment we depend on for existence and overpopulating the planet, combined with too much globalism, which results in VERY easy disease spreading as we're now realizing in 2020. \n\nOh, I don't think we'll even make it another 1,000 years, much less 10,000 or ..74,000. That is a LONG time for the planet to put up with our stupidity without snuffing us out...and believe me, ask the dinosaurs, the universe has ways of making the guys on top go away pretty quickly. Only in our human arrogance would be presume ourselves poised to last another 74,000 years at the rate we're going. Our kind has scarcely been around 200,000 years (compare that with the 160 million + years the dinosaurs had) and we've only had organized societies for the last 8,000 years or so, and look where we are. We may wipe ourselves out with germ warefare, or nukes, or by essentially starving ourselves out of existence by destroying the environment, or baking ourselves out of existence by pumping all those gasses into the atmosphere and acting like it'll all be fine. \n\nWell, it WILL be fine. For the planet. The planet - and life on earth - will out-survive us by a wide margin. EVERY species goes extinct. Every single one. We are NO exception. We dream lofty dreams of sailing the stairs on faster-than-light ships, but the reality is...we have no feasible way of making that happen. Currently, our fastest-ever devices would still take us the better part of 20,000 years just to reach the nearest star, MUCH LESS the nearest HABITABLE planet, which is likely much, much, MUCH further than that. So no. We aren't going anywhere. Warp drives are not going to be a thing. Physics impose real limits on travel. Mars has next to no atmosphere and while we may land a few crafts or start a few colonies there, that's not going to save the species - if anything, a domed colony is INCREDIBLY fragile by nature. Decompression, disease, terrorism, micro-meteorites, radiation, any number of things can scrub a colony clean of human life. We're fragile beings - and we're learning that in 2020 as this virus spreads like wildfire and we just HOPE it won't mutate into something even deadlier. \n\nI'm only sad I won't be around in 74,000 years to see how long forgotten the human race is. I'll bet if I could travel to that time, I'd see the creeping glaciers, I'd see the beginnings of some new species - the first telltale mutations in some lifeforms that will lead to whole other species in the future - I'd feel the cold and...there would be no sign of US. Anywhere. Unless, perhaps, if I were to dig into the ground and come across the crumbled remains of our once-towering cities - now dust, rubble, and micro-plastics in a thin layer a few meters down. The animals above never being the wiser that once, there was a strange kind of primate that dominated these lands, so cocksure in its invincibility that it did nothing to prepare for the knockout punch that came its way - perhaps that punch was a sudden rise of extreme volcanism worldwide, or disease, a massive asteroid strike, MULTIPLE asteroid strikes, extreme climate shifts, or a combination of the above.

Much of northern Eurasia and northern North America would be practically uninhabitable.

First off it isn't the greenhouse effect. Humans only produce one fifth of the total greenhouse gas carbon dioxide--the rest is natural--and carbon dioxide is less than one fifth of total greenhouse effect--the rest is due to water vapor. \nSo only one fifth of one fifth of the total greenhouse effect has anything to do with human activity--so humans contribute less than one twenty-fifth of the greenhouse effect--and the greenhouse effect itself is only one of the many, more powerful, natural forces described in this video. \nMeaning the climate is going to go right on changing regardless of what puny humans do about fossil fuels. \nAnd if we do nothing about fossil fuels, in another fifty to a hundred years technology will make renewables and nuclear energy cheaper and more abundant anyway, which will phase out fossil fuel by simple market forces. \nCase closed.

{"cid": "UgyFJpApPhPNjMFjB_Z4AaABAg", "text": "Ah the Milankovitch cycles it is fascinating how their effects have played into the role of the role of climate variability but it should probably be worth noting that these effects are minor compared to other driving factors such as carbon dioxide and thus usually only emerge when the climate is near a carbon instability threshold where the planet is in between a Ice Free or hothouse state and the full snowball state that planet thankfully hasn't experienced since the Neoprotozoic. When working on my term paper for my atmospheric physics class it was fascinating to read about the Snowball Earth and the various interplays that precipitated the extreme climate shift and the Ice Albedo effect was one of the main drivers (though not the sole factor) but the Milankovitch cycles came into play there as the planet's CO2 levels and surface albedo changed (largely driven because ice precipitated mainly near the poles and sublimated near the Equator allowing the ice there to gradually darken thanks to particulates being left behind). Basically the cycles appear in between the full ice and full hothouse states when the climate gets near but not quite at a tipping point thankfully the Earth hasn't seen a full Snowball state since the Neoprotozoic where it seems it may have driven our ancestors to become multi-cellular to survive Perhaps we could have a video on the Neoprotozoic Snowball states and the now recognized complex dynamics that drove the emergence of the metazoa? \n\n\nAlways love to see what you have produced video wise.  Ok I admit there was that one exception with was the episode on flowering plants where you went with the younger fossil record then oldest  fossil flower at that time, as opposed to the multiple lines for an older origin including coprolites pollen fossils and molecular clock dating of divergence times. Then paleontologists found a 50 million year older fossilized flower that looked both far more modern  or advanced from the Early Jurassic far closer to the  late Triassic origin suggested by other lines of evidence maybe we could get an up to date video on the origins of plants while addressing that nature throws curveballs like fossils of then living fossils?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Dragrath1", "channel": "UC2vXqt1H_1nkVF9Px_RyLKw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQTQKHwl7y_EdYGBmQq3Hpwvdkhr3kEebnwJQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzFrO8a_14DdQLoQ1V4AaABAg", "text": "Humans were well spread throughout the Asian steppes, and likely encountered the Siberian unicorn. It is then possible that the unicorn myth may have started tens of thousands of years ago, inspired by the Siberian unicorn. Here’s what famous Arabic medieval traveller Ibn Fadlan wrote about how locals describe a mythical unicorn, with startling similarities to E. sibiricum: \n\n\n\n“Near this river (the Volga) is a vast wilderness wherein they say is an animal that is less than a camel and more like a bull in size. Its head is like the head of a camel, and its tail is like the tail of a bull, while its body is like the body of a mule, and its hooves are like the cloven hooves of a bull. In the center of its head, it has a thick round horn, which as it rises from the head of the animal gets to be thinner until it becomes like the point of a lance. The length of some of these horns is from three to five cubits (roughly 4.5-7.5 feet), and there are those that may attain to a greater or lesserlength. The animal grazes on the leaves of trees, which are quite green. When it sees a horseman, it makes straight for him, and if he happens to have under him a fast horse, he is rendered safe from it with some effort. If it overtakes him, it removes him from the back of his horse with its horn, hurls him into the air, and then catches him with its horn. It continues in this manner until it kills him. It does not bother the horse in any form or manner. They seek out this animal in the forests in order to kill it. They do that by climbing the tall trees among which it is found, and with this object in mind, they assemble a number of archers with poisoned arrows. When it stands in their midst, they shoot at it until it is severely wounded and killed by them.” \n\n\n\nIt would truly be amazing if  E. sibiricum was the root of the unicorn myth. Such a hypothesis, though impossible to prove, is not that far fetched. So similar to what science has unearthed about this creature today, you can see where the unicorn myth started with sightings of this creature. It was rare, it left horses alone. By time it morphed into a horse.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Exnem", "channel": "UCxVppYLMC8B3KB7x0ceNPBg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT2wWzqLrQMwcW8kbSNez-7Iyom8-Pa0qi6-EQAzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

CO2 is literally one of the weakest greenhouse gases known to man and levels have been 500x what they are today in prehistoric times. It's also worth mentioning that CO2 is NOT a leading factor as it relates to warming but a trailing factor. Meaning CO2 doesn't cause global temperature rise. Temperature rise causes CO2 rise. In fact CO2 is at its lowest point on an evolutionary scale than at any other time in earths existence. So much in fact that we could be looking at an extinction level event for all plants on our planet within the next 800 million years. Does this mean that I don't care about the planet?

It's basic radiation physics (energy absorption / emission) combined with basic celestial mechanics. It lines up pretty well and is only complexified by the internal dynamics of earth's atmosphere.\n\"it more likely the sun went through a cooling cycle\" ... That line shows exactly he has no understanding of physics. Celestial mechanics create much more precise cycles than any internal dynamics of the sun could ever generate. Of course, there are multiple overlapping cycles of varying periods and even some monotonic (i.e. non-periodic) dynamics on top (such as the moon moving away from the earth), so that the resulting characteristics generate some complexity. But we do have the mathematical tools to verify what has been said in this video to a significant degree. Large scale modulations generated by the movement and rotations of earth and other celestial bodies do not even have to cause climate cycles on their own. Stochastic resonance teaches us that such modulations may still need some intensity of noise on top of it to actually trigger a shift in climate. And the complex internal dynamics of the earth's atmosphere does provide exactly that in the form of chaotic dynamics. Depending on the intensity of this noise the resulting climate dynamics may or may not resonate quite well with the large scale modulations. If the noise intensity is too low, they can't cause shifts in climate. If it's too high, then shifts will appear more frequently, thus with less correlation to the periods of large scale modulations. If it's within a certain range, there will be a strong resonance with the large scale modulations.\nHowever, I think radiation physics combined with celestial mechanics does provide a strong enough modulation to trigger these climate shifts on their own, especially given the positive feedback loops in each direction generated by the surface area of ice.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "parityviolation", "channel": "UCaM3uOmOj3QM6paI1t6U45g", "votes": "12", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ_K2WYU_vxwuDxhqHWkvTv-ZDCl3Hu3EhdLA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's actually kind of mind-boggling to think about how much of an effect this cyclic warming and cooling must have had on the evolution of basically all living things!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "hstera", "channel": "UCUDQpw4X9nNfEnqdfRtjUnA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRTo5yQqHOYhs_8d3g1sb3HaxpBR459VQQp4i1Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyPVu4S4LPlph5Pt_R4AaABAg.8v_NS0iQWga94URN23X3A_", "text": "Green house gases aren't limited to the emissions of burning fossil fuels.  Methane is a major contributor and is produced by rotting things.  Humans, since their development of mechanised industry, have greatly increased the consumption of raw materials and the waste thereof, resulting in more rotting biological material.  In addition, mechanised industry reduced the amount of human labour necessary to create and produce what was needed though agriculture remained largely unaffected for a long time.  Well, this mechanised industry got shifted into overdrive at the beginning of the 20th century which is when human populations were sustainably living longer, consuming more over those increased years of life, it also gave rise to mechanised warfare.  Machines did (and most still do) need a lot of fossil fuel products to operate and maintain.  Some of these also resulted in explosive materials being introduced to environments where they never previously existed, even when the earliest bombs were made several hundred years before the beginning of WW I.  This further escalated when hydrogen and atomic bombs were even tested, let alone used offensively.  The point is, even though use of fossil fuels contributes, the ultimately root cause is the existence of humans who never really considered the effects of their actions then raised their noses and scoffed at being rightfully accused of contributing to a more rapid alteration of climate change.  Even without fossil fuels at all, humans have been the cause of extinctions, toxicity and elevated emissions of greenhouse gases which all play a role in climate change.  The planet and the atmosphere are a closed system.  Cause destruction of any part of it, even a seemingly insignificant part, and the whole is negatively affected.  Some things can be countered over time but at the rate humans consume and consequently produce waste, normal and natural cycles can't keep up.  Yet.  We won't survive a lot longer at the rate and in the direction we are going.  Eventually, everything will return to equilibrium.

Also plenty of people live in desert climates all across the Sahara and the Middle East.

Even the Siberian Traps in Russia dont really cover that much of the land percentage-wise. Food, however, would be a huge issue as humans can't really eat ferns or trees, which is really all that was around at that time.

Basically when trees first evolved there weren't any microbes or bacteria that could break then down for millions of years. So trees would die, fall over, and instead of decomposing like today they would be covered by sediment. \nAnother way coal formed during the Carboniferous was due to the extensive swamps that existed at the time. Many plants sunk into these swamps and, similarly to trees, weren't decomposed by other organisms, so they became coal. The latter of these processes can be seen today in peat bogs, where peat is gathered and used for fuel.\n\nThis is important in the context of climate because all of that coal is essentially carbon that had been removed from the planetary climate for hundreds of millions of years, and now we are releasing it back into the atmosphere, which is a variable that hasn't existed in the cycles talked about in the video.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "TheShadixDarkkon", "channel": "UCvkbvegA--9ea-5p1VkJrwQ", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRzQTFT3k2wDBppTeIAoZ9WZLGz2VD-u1MtgQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Well, there is a second precession going on at the same time, the so called apsidal precession, during which the orientation of Earth's orbit slowly shifts. Basically, every year the perihelion (the point in Earth's orbit furthest away from the Sun) moves forward a couple of arcseconds every year, forming a cycle that repeats itself every 112,000 years. Due to these two phenome combining with each other, the rotational axis of Earth rotates once every 20,900 - 29,000 years, with an average of 23,000 years.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Marcus Tullius Cicero", "channel": "UCzlABcQndhDDcppjRa1rKwA", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSfmxoDhkS0m0xGQ1dpeoNNZeBXPmBSztyGNA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Currently, there are some clinical trials in which we transplant tissues which arise from stem cells (which on the other hand are often made from skin cells but I will talk about this in my next video). I am personally really looking forward to reading the results of a study which tries to cure type 1 diabetes through the transplantation of insulin-producing beta cells. There are many reasons why we are currently more focusing on producing tissues rather than whole organs. One very important factor here is safety. It is very difficult to control the development of stem cells to create whole organs (we need to understand developmental processes way better). If we try to transplant something as complex as an organ we could not guarantee that cells in this organ might not become harmful for the recipient (and provoke teratoma which are tumour-like cell aggregations). I cannot precisely tell you how long it will take until we have overcome all these challenges but we are making remarkable progress (about 15 years ago we were not even able to make stem cells from skin cells)!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Life Lab Learner", "channel": "UCKcFCFCbwDEiipcYvatGXcQ", "votes": "17", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSo1lDWSuqODBVoxlkSAwau3WpKPukmiGlQRg4XIQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
