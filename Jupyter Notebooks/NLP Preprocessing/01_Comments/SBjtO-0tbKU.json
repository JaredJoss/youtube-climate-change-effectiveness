{"cid": "UgwW8VNZJYh7srkdbQ94AaABAg", "text": "For thinking people; ah,the great debate on climate change. One way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it, then look to see what sticks and what's removed.\n\nI have done this over the las tweek on at least forty of the major and taking one side or another.  What I found is that usually within 48 hours,anything I say that doesn't support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is neutral or supportive, while anything posted that would support the argument stays. Makes one wonder where the money is coming from... So, first my honest thoughts about this. \n\nFrom NASA:  Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the ice age would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional “blips” every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth's orbit—eccentricity, obliquity,and —affect global climate. \n\nBut it's a lot more complicated than that.  And, the last ice age wasabout 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn't do so well because it'shard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis. Whales, insects and such do muchbetter and have been doing so for 100's of millions of years. \n\nSo, I totally believe in climate change... It's been going on for 100's of millions of years,since planet formation.  Long before humans arrived; and yep, the ice capsmelt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive. \n\nThe truth is that state-of-the-art weather prediction can't predict the weather next week anywhere on the planet. These computer models make the wrong prediction, 100% of the time.

I would like to know where all the extra co2 is coming from, given that there is only so much co2 available on the planet.  No one is making new co2.  Nature has not done anything just so that mankind can survive.  Nature does not love humanity.  All gasses are actually recycled.  For instance, it is known that millions of years ago, the concentrations of oxygen were far higher than today, which resulted in animals and even insects being much larger, followed by climatic events which wiped out life to a great extent.  Subsequent to these events, the levels of gasses were altered, resulting in different lifeforms which were adapted to exist in those environments.  So, given that plants require co2 to exist and the fact that plants exposed to large doses of co2 will actually increase in size massively compared to those plants receiving less co2, could you please explain why we are not completely surrounded by greenery?  Incidentally to this, I want you to know that I do believe that the planet has been damaged by mankind, but co2 is only the latest scapegoat, not the problem.  Our biggest problem is physical pollution and waste.  Most of the figures that are being bandied about come from computer modelling, based on equations that can be made to fit. There are historic records that show that nothing is actually any different from 100 years ago.  The newspaper reports from around the world that describe events with recorded weather that show this.  In the 1970s and 1980s, people were saying that we would be in an ice age by the year 2020.  These articles are easily found in newspaper archives.  There are loads of them from the USA at that time.  Believe nothing you hear and half of what you see and you may find some truth.  If you put me in your fish bowl what will happen is that I will probably eat your fish.

{"cid": "Ugz7-u5Kzh-iotD3h0N4AaABAg", "text": "humans are not the problem because carbon dioxide can not do what the IPCC says it can.  An increase in CO2 without an increase in the few frequencies of radiation that can have an effect on CO2 means nothing in the increase of warming in the atmosphere or anywhere else.  Of the 680 frequencies of infrared radiation between 2.0 and 70.0 micrometers, only around four frequencies will cause the vibrations in carbon dioxide.  None of these frequencies would ever leave the earth's atmosphere even if all carbon dioxide were removed from the atmosphere because other gases cause them to be refracted, reflected and absorbed.\nAn increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is caused by an increased in warming (not the other way around).  This fact can be seen in the Ice Core Project data and is the reason Al Gore did not overlay the two charts of historic temperature and carbon dioxide levels in his video.  The over and under sight lines of 400,000 years of records on a chart do not allow fine focus on the details.  You can freeze frame the video and use a straight edge or simply look up the data yourself (ironically, one of the few scientific references that still shows up on the first few pages of a google search -- but that may change in the next decade like other reports have as you start using the data correctly).  The lighter gases rise higher as the heavier carbon dioxide tends to remain in lower elevations.  One lighter gas is water vapor which, during times of higher carbon dioxide concentration, can form clouds at higher elevations.

{"cid": "Ugx-aFHOkRlONbNyRTR4AaABAg", "text": "It's amazing how many people miss the point of this talk. The man is not a scientist. He did not prepare a speech with scientific facts, because scientists are best suited for that role. And there is overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change exists and is man-driven. His speech is about paying attention to these facts and also paying attention to the fact that there are some very powerful people that have a short-term interest in keeping things as they are, because they profit. And he reminds us of similar past cases. The major difference with this case is that instead of hundreds of thousand of people dying of lung cancer because of the industry lying, it is the world as we know it that is in danger of perishing.\nEvery one that denies climate change should try and think why it really is that they have this opinion. How have they formed it? Through scientific study? Through reading science journals? Or is it through the opinions of others? Who are these others? Do they have anything to gain by saying this?\nMy guess is that, as always, people are afraid of change. They are afraid of the changes that will be needed to combat climate change. They are afraid of the extra taxes needed to pay for large scale programs. So when they hear someone discrediting climate change, they want to believe it. But why isn't anyone thinking that it is the richer that will have to overwhelmingly pay for this? They profited the most from the current economic model that polluted the world. So they will have to pay proportionately more to combat the problem. So the poor many should not be so afraid of that aspect. But more to the point, shouldn't people be afraid of the cost of not doing anything? What is it that makes people so reassured that things will not get bad?\nAgain, this is something for which we have to listen to the experts. And the experts that the human race has created in its intellectual journey through the ages, trying to find the truth about reality, is scientists. Science is what the human race has come up with to give real, provable, testable answers to questions. Few people, of those reading this, I would think, would go to a witch-doctor to treat their illness. Even fewer would stop using their cell phones because they were made by that despicable sect of scientists.\nThink about the logic (or lack thereof) of this cherry-picking: I have no problem with using cell phones, aeroplanes, toasters etc. but when it comes to climate change, I will not listen to the overwhelming majority of scientists. Science is not an industry. Coal-mining, car-making, oil-drilling are industries. Do people really believe that thousands of scientists around the world have made a pact and have a vested interest in making us believe in climate change? And do people really believe that the coal, oil and automobile industries (to name but a few) do not have any interest in keeping things as they are?\nIf so, then there is nothing more I can say.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "AXZ1974", "channel": "UCk28vvd_UvSUdYtPh33v1qg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKtIrP4wz0UvmVrvquBERTpDvbjeGYCnyl=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Because seat belts saved lives but car manufacturers did not believe seat belts worked; man made global warming is some how relevant. The same for the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Iraqi War. Slavery.

In fact, it seems as though slavery was preventing such an industrial revolution.\n\nI mean; certainly, if the costs of the coastal communities affected by hurricanes is going up - it's either 2 things: the climate is indeed getting out of hand and extreme because of man putting more CO2 into the atmosphere. OR, hear me out, because this might surprise you! More people are living on the coast. Well,why not both? Because we have the data. And the data shows us that the hurricanes are not getting more extreme. In fact weather is getting less extreme in general. It is just that more people are living in environments where extreme weather is likely to occur because the severity is in decline. And when an extreme weather phenomenon occurs, more people are effected, and more people with more developed land means more money is needed to fix the problem.\n\nInstead of looking at the total cost of damages, which is increasing, we need to look at the cost of damage per capita, which is decreasing (adjusted for inflation). \"This\" is \"the reality\" of the situation.\n\nIt doesn't have much to do with anthropogenic clime change, actually.

Now consider what temperature we're  heading for with 400 ppm. Half as much again. Luckily the greenhouse effect has a dimminishing return so it wont be like 40°C . Or we would be  f*** ked. But even a couple of degrees will be dangerous and disruptive to our way of life.

Yes there is resistance from some quaters, but the big fossil fuel corporations are backing both sides of the game. Putman like many others promotes the idea that humans are a surge on the earth and that we need to be controlled by big government in order to limit our behaviour. This is the path toward global totalitarianism. The way is being paved for a global technocracy, with the 5G internet of things being the enabler of the control grid. Yes, humans are behaving in many self destructive ways that impact on our environment, but the planet will ultimately shrug us off. The real challenge is for us to find ourselves as incarnate spirits, so that we can learn to behave in a healthy manner as our natural expression rather than creating control systems to enslave and dehumanise us. The sad thing is, so many well meaning people have let themselves, through the manipulation of group think, be hood winked into believing the man made C02, climate change hoax. The physics just does not support the theory, but no re-examination and debate on the science is allowed because the truth would be revealed and the house of cards would fall. For those who say it doesn't matter if the science is true or not, because we need to be made to live without polluting and wasting energy anyway, they ignore the fact that the solutions offered us for climate change is all about C02 and include the corrupt carbon trading market, dangerous geoengineering technologies, nuclear power, carbon sequestration and the aforementioned internet of things, 5G control grid microwave panopticon.

I found 12 decent books on Amazon written by phd’s and numerous scientists disputing the conclusions and methods of the IPCC. Interestingly the IPCC itself is pulling back on its earliest predictions. Hopefully this mess will get addressed with Trumps new Commission to explore it. It’s very difficult to embrace something coming out of the United Nations without wanting some independent checking of sources and methods. The institution is simply too corrupt. I find the UN itself to be more like the tobacco industry than the ‘deniers’. As it is, suppressing energy development in the third world due to climate concerns is destroying people’s lives just as the decision to cease use of DDT condemned so many Africans to death from malaria.

The temperature of Sweden is gonna be much lower than the temperature of Egypt, right? But both places can successfully sustain human life. Climate is more about how the atmosphere behaves over relatively long periods of time. Due to the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere, global climate is changing because heat from the sun is having a harder time escaping Earth. Due to this change in climate, worldwide temperatures are increasing which changes the weather and livability of many places. For example, agriculture is completely dependent on a region's climate because certain crops grow better in different circumstances. All throughout Africa and Asia, food production is going to plummet due to heat, droughts, and unpredictable flooding. The number 1 thing that we as humans should worry about right now is slowing down climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If we do that, that maybe we can prevent the situation from becoming even more disastrous.   @Adam Eisen ", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Zach Smith", "channel": "UC3uuWUuFDMQ9JKJNdCEBjzw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRT4mbaXH_CuEWeGRDLZU1IwTv_GcTy2vfOSg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Unfortunately, consensus with respect to global warming ignores reality i.e. facts, cause and effect, and the scientific method.\n\nHow about some real hard cold scientific facts about atmospheric CO2? The inconvenient truth is that earths historical record for the last one billion years shows that the average CO2 level was around 2000 ppm and could at times be orders of magnitude higher. Fossil records show massive plant growth in all hemispheres of the planet which in turn lead to huge animal populations and derversity of species. In other words life on earth thrives when CO2 concentration averages 2000 ppm or higher.  During ice ages, the historical record shows that CO2 concentrations could get dangerously below 200 ppm.  Plants begin to die at 200 ppm.  Plant growth nearly stopped and had the CO2 concentration continued to decrease below 150 ppm then all life on earth would have become extinct. Today CO2 is about 400 ppm which is 5 times below the natural average background level of atmospheric CO2. \n\nLast time I checked man had no appreciable contribution to atmospheric CO2 over the last one billion years... The natural mass of CO2 in the atmosphere is around 750 gigatons . Mans contribution is about 6 gigatons. There is no way such an infinitesimal amount of CO2 could drive earths climate.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "ecbravo999", "channel": "UCP68chquLBdvsPaVdUTLETQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTWQ_aBxvOaR4kpEedLcndWN0_DVGwtIV-Nog=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It must be settled science.\"\n\nI want to address this comment indirectly because it was made some time ago and I think an independent comment may be seen by more people. The consensus regarding climate science is, significantly, not about whether scientists agree with one another. It refers to consensus of published literature, and by extension, evidence. 97.3% of all peer reviewed papers which express a position on the question of anthropogenic climate change (that is, is it real, and did humans cause it) agree that indeed, the earth is warming and humans are responsible. \n\nThe flagrant dismissal of scientific consensus as \"opinions of the experts\" misses the critical notion that we are not talking about opinions here, we are talking about the combined evidence and research of every scientific climatological institution on the entire planet.

I have never had a problem stopping smoking for periods of time. Sometimes for days. Sometimes for months and years. As of today for example I haven't had a cigarette in about a week. If I have a cocktail sometime in the near future I might have a cigarette. Oh there have been times when I smoked a pack or more a day for years. After this would go on for 10 or 15 years there would come a day when I would tire of it. So I would just stop doing it. In as much as people can be convinced that nicotine is addictive they too could be convinced that global warming is manmade. Now please don't misunderstand me. I am an environmentalist and hate pollution. But the idea that man has changed the temperature of the earth is absurd. Oh sure having a layer of gases around the planet might insulate it in theory. The amount of temperature change from this source is almost insignificant. Ice core samples from the poles have substantiated this. The source of almost all  temperature change is none other than the Sun. The sun's energy output is cyclical. That is why the history of the earth shows ice-ages and warming periods. When we came out of the last ice-age for example there was no industry at all on earth. Yet a period of global warming occured that totally dwarfs what we're seeing today.  So the motivation for this hypothesis is good. Anything which gets the world's attention and causes people to minimize pollution is a very, very good thing.

Climate scientists agree that CO2 has an impact. They don't all agree that it should be a political issue or that the impact is justification for carbon taxes and tariffs. They aren't skeptical of science they are skeptical of politicians. Here are few good reasons why:\n\n1. Humanities primate ancestors were alive when there was 4000ppm CO2. That's a hard pill to swallow when we're squawking over 400, and good evidence against runaway green house effects. \n2. In the ice core data temperature always changes before CO2 and the lag is thousands of years. So there's no evidence on a geological timescale that temperature would follow CO2.\n3. CO2 can absorb all radiation in its spectrum with its current level, increasing it makes it absorb these wavelengths a few meters further up. \n4. Water is the main green house gas by far. It absorbs a wider spectrum of light and because it moves through a huge range of altitudes it insulates Earth much better than CO2 which stays near the ground after it cools from being emitted.\n5. Plants are made of carbon and get it from the air. More CO2 could potentially make plant life grow better for that reason alone.  \n\nTeachers in environmental science classes and politicians have all been taught an oversimplified political propaganda.

The abolition of slavery forced the industrial revolution upon us and innovation sprung forth as it was previously being kept down by the easy money of slavery.\n\nThat's backasswards.   The Industrial Revolution came about at it's own pace, and could not have come faster as much science had to be done first.   The abolition of slavery was at least in part caused by the Industrial Revolution reaching its teenage years as steam engines far surpassed the productivity and profit to be made from slaves. \n\nA bit more: the increase in European prosperity brought about by colonialism played a big role in funding the science and engineering research needed to bring about the Industrial Revolution.\n\nDoing a moral reversal on history to argue for some kind of new morality is an old trick and folks should be wise to it.\n\nThe led lightbulb came rather late, but was only marginally caused by the new morality of sustainability.   Actually, until the mid 90s physicists were almost all convinced that the led could not get much brighter than those little ones used to show that power is on or this or that setting has been chosen.   It was just two senior engineer/researches in, I think, S. Korea that just kept plugging away until one day they figured out a cool trick on the quantum level that gave us bright leds light bulbs. These guys weren't trying to save the world they were just obsessed geeks looking to make a profit.   One has to see that the massive use of fossil fuels creaated the prosperity to fund so much reasearch in  quantum physics that enough had become known so that two geeks could find the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nFortunately sci and tech do move ahead somewhat quickly, but they do so only when there is sufficient prosperity to fund it, and solutions just can't be found because they're wanted but some in their own time (as long as there is prosperity).  \n\nYou can't forced major changes on society and then safely assume technology will come to the rescue...it may or it may not.

{"cid": "UgwZlFmTZ88GZ_EBxiB4AaABAg", "text": "Great emotionally-laden talk.  However, not one scientific fact or premise was discussed.  Rather, we see a demonstration of tying slavery, the ills of the industrial revolution and the evilness of the tobacco industry.  All good points, but it is only indicative of human nature at certain points in time, and has little if anything to do with the evidence for climate change.  \n\n\n\nThe earth has endured periods of warmth and coldness that far surpass any trends in the last 20 or 200 years.  CO2 levels have been as high as 7,000 PPM vs today's roughly 400 PPM.  \n\nBelow are a series of questions I would challenge you to consider in assessing the severity of climate change and the ability to effectively do anything about it.  Here are a set of questions, any of which would lead to the conclusion that we don’t need to spend a dime on global warming.  I will assume that for each question that we answer in support of climate change.  Just realize that at any point of the questions that a no or not sure invalidates any logic that we should spend billions or trillions of dollars.\n\nKey Questions to Ask about the Truth of Climate Change\n\n\n1)  Is the world actually warming?  \n\nThe earth has actually been in a cooling phase or at least a pause for the last 18 years.  Thus the change to the climate change to further obfuscate the issue.  Hurricanes, tornadoes, and droughts have actually decreased in recent decades, not become more severe.  If we pull back a million years, or even better, a billion years, we see a steady swing of temperature changes that make Al Gore's hockey stick loot insignificant.  But let us say the earth is warming, then the question is:\n\n\n 2)  Is the climate change significant enough to pose a threat to the planet?  \n\nThe earth has been going through changes in climate constantly, from seasons to decades to eons.  Normal fluctuations have been occurring forever without humans being the cause.  But again let’s assume there is some sort of threat that we should pay attention to.\n\n\n 3)  Is the climate change being caused by humans?  \n\nCO2, the culprit most cited by global warming alarmist, is only  400 parts per million in the atmosphere.  The vast majority of CO2 comes from the oceans, decaying biomass, and volcanoes.  Only one-tenth of CO2 comes from humans or 40 parts in one million.  CO2 has ranged from 7,000 parts per million to as low as 180 parts per million - and life survived.  \n\n\nIn fact, in times of higher CO2 concentrations, agriculture flourished, famine was reduced and human advancement increased. Arctic and Antartic ice cores conclusively show over and over that periods of significant temperature rise always precedes the rise in CO2; by many decades or even hundreds of years.  Why?  Because the Ocean, the largest repository of CO2, releases it as temperatures rise.  This leads to massive increases in vegetation which as it dies also releases prodigious amounts of stored CO2.  CO2 continues to rise, as a lagged effect, for decades or centuries after a cooling period has started.\n\n\n\nCO2 as a greenhouse gas is a poor retainer of heat.  Yes, it does as a GHG, elevate temperature especially between zero and 400 PPM.  However, it is ever decreasing asymptotic curve of diminishing effect.  It is estimated that a doubling of CO2 to 800 PPM would only have a .7 degree C impact on global average temperatures.  But let us for argument sake say that global warming is real and it poses a threat and it is man-made. Let's not forget that water vapor is by far the most abundant GHG (about 85% of GHGs).  It has far greater impact on heat absorbtion in the atmosphere than CO2\n\n \n\n4)  Is there something that we can practically do to change the threat of global warming?\n\nShort of shutting down all fossil fuel consumption, what is it we can do?  Will better MPG or electric cars (which use energy from electric plants that predominately burn fossil fuels) stop climate change?  Will going to all solar and wind help?  By the way, only about 3% of US energy comes from these highly subsidized yet unprofitable businesses. These technologies do not have the ability or resources to provide the energy needed to run the US economy, and won’t have it for decades.  If we shut everything down will it make a difference?  What data, analysis, or studies show that a 100% effort by humans would change the natural temperature cycles the earth has experienced?  But let’s assume we can, next question:\n\n\n \n\n5)  If there are practical things we can do, are they affordable?   Who is going to pay for all this climate change remediation?  \n\nDo we even have a plan of what actions we would take, what the timeline would be, or most importantly how much it would cost?  What is the plan except carbon taxing?  Will the poorest 150 countries contribute any money?  Probably not.  Will India or China (who both out pollute the US) agree to divert huge national resources away from their growing economies to solve a problem that many believe doesn’t exist?  \n\nCan the US, which is already $20T in debt have the resources?  All the billionaires in the US only have about $2.2T and all the millionaires only about $19T.  Where does the money come from?  Especially if we want to continue to increase US entitlements?  Trump rightly pulled out of the Paris Accord because the US was being paying  the perponderance of the costs, and countries like China and India were being allowed to continute to pollute. But let’s assume we can afford it.  Next question.\n\n\n 6)  Do we as citizens of the world have the political will to allow our leaders to effect massive changes that directly affect our pocketbooks, our lifestyles and consumption patterns?   \n\nWould we be willing to go back to the lifestyle of the pre-industrial world?  No electricity, no cars, no iPhones, no lights, no A/C?  Okay, maybe not that drastic - how about limiting car usage, rationing electricity,  moving us all into smaller “sustainable” 1970 era Russian-like apartments?  \n\n\nIf we restrict fossil fuels won’t people start cutting down trees to heat their homes and doing other unhealthy environmental things?  What do we do when nations ignore the rules?  Do we succumb to a one-world government that has the power and control to force us?\n\nIs it global warming real? Is it a threat? Are humans a significant cause? Is there something we can do about it?  Can we afford to fix it? \n\nFinally, are we all willing to sacrifice, money, freedoms, and lifestyle to make it happen? It is a lot of ifs, and I for one am not willing to give our government further control of my life on a bunch of flimsy ifs.  Who benefits if climate change is a hoax or is being vastly overblown?  Government!  It gives them more power, more control; and for us, less personal freedom and ultimately, a world dominated by elites and not of, for and by the people.\n\n\n I am not a climate denier, I am a government skeptic!! Do we need to be prudent proactive stewards of the earth?  Of course!  Do we need to be told to change our lives based on politicized science - not on my watch!  There is no such thing as settled science, that is a non-sequitur.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Coloradoron", "channel": "UCLY52h2EdSKIVmflJBwAx1g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSakchsKT_SiMGLhNiMn8Wod6nbwCyEEl_yvg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So yes, there is really big money involved here. That makes it worthwhile for those involved to spend heavily on promotion of the climate change agenda. \n\nThe climate alarmists are also very keen to promote the idea that 'Big Oil' whatever that is funds 'Denialism.' Yet, there is not a shred of evidence that it takes place. To the contrary, we know that the renewables industry funds activist groups like Greenpeace to promote their products. The evidence of that is incontrovertible. \n\nThey also campaign to discredit the products of their competitors, like shale gas, with all kinds of propaganda. Now, if that were to go on between two companies in any other sector it would be treated as serious malpractice. But, not here. Why? \n\nThe alarmists seem to think that is OK, presumably because they regard their cause as a noble one. BUT -suppose just for a moment, that it were NOT a noble one, but a self-interested one. What then? \n\nIf the motive is simply one of profit, then it is exactly that which they accuse the oil companies of doing, namely of creating shill promoters of their products. \n\nHere's the rub: This huge expenditure has had no beneficial effect whatsoever. Carbon dioxide levels are still rising at \nthe same rate. Even after 20 years of deployment, the proportion of global electricity from renewables is only 4%. Now, does that make you think again about who is engaging in the profit motive here?\n\nThe flood of propaganda from climate activist groups has clouded the minds of the public, such that many can no longer see this situation for what it is.

The sun heats the earth (atmospheric CO2 being transparent to VISIBLE light), the Earth then radiates that heat at invisible infrared wavelengths, of which CO2 absorbs a tiny amount in two limited bands, but then re-emits the absorbed energy, half of which goes upwards. In the meantime, water vapour is doing pretty much the same thing, but over much larger swathes of the infrared band. It also forms clouds, which attenuate visible light to a degree, preventing the sun from warming the ground, but also trapping the infrared being radiated from the ground, keeping the Earth's surface at a more stable temperature.overall. The Earth is not a greenhouse, as it has no 'roof', so convection carries heat into the upper atmosphere, while greenhouses work because the glass allows in visible light, but blocks both convective cooling and radiative cooling by infrared. Ergo, there is no 'greenhouse' effect, and CO2 is not warming the Earth to any significant degree.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ian Hughes", "channel": "UCsfx33o3G9A72E-d0vyPMhw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSHuCpda9a8SIn-A4Qhd1iIErjf4BYOKYsTXfwRGw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Even though it does not trap as much heat as the other greenhouse gases, it is the second most abundant after water vapor. Recent observations and experiments from Nasa show that water vapor can double the effect of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. CO2 does have a significant effect directly and indirectly. CO2 traps heat and we keep pumping more of it into the atmosphere and cutting down more rainforests. The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled by temperatures, the higher the temperature, the more water that evaporates. CO2 is the second most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and it is a fact that we are contributing to global warming by pumping more of it into the atmosphere. Also, CO2 tends to stick around for a long time if not absorbed by carbon sinks, 300 to 1000 years. Water vapor lasts in the atmosphere for approx. 10 days, that is a major difference. Data shows that the CO2 percentages are much higher than in the last 800 000 years.

Also, what is this assertion about water vapour only lasting 10 days? CO2 is a gas only, while water exists on Earth in all three phases; solid, liquid and gas. The ocean covers 70% of the surface, and is continually exchanging vapour with the liquid phase, so the percent of vapour in the atmosphere varies from place to place, and time to time. It also, as I have already said, forms clouds, which block incoming radiation, but also block long wave radiation from the surface, leading to both warming and cooling. CO2 on the other hand only dissolves in water, removing itself from the atmosphere for a very long time, depending on the surface water temperature, which also changes by location, time of day and time of year.

There is no doubt CO2 helps increase global temperatures and this, therefore, increases evaporation. I completely agree with the facts you are stating. All I am saying is that CO2 does have a significant effect when you see its effect beyond just its ability to trap heat. For example, CO2 lowers the pH of the ocean. Corals have a very specific pH in which they can live in, and they are home to many marine species. When they die out, these marine species lose their homes and they may also face extinction. This leads to a boom in plankton and micro-organisms that photosynthesize. This will affect other organisms in the area like predators of the organisms that lived in the coral reefs. The boom in plankton also does not last long, as there will be competition in nutrients and because of the death of many marine species, there is no complete nutrient cycle. With fewer algae and photosynthetic micro-organisms, less oxygen is produced. Without these photosynthetic organisms, a lot of the CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for longer leading to more temperature rise and more water vapor in the atmosphere. As you can see, CO2 does have a significant impact.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Cassandra Frank", "channel": "UChxLLpd2RZdUgY3engCEuBw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTX17pb2BOQO0jn7kQtWEkqz0q7oFjpDUPX6Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We have just finished a period of solar maximum where the sun spot average was higher for the past 170 years and that corresponds to how long the planet has been warming. Now we are entering a period where sun count will be significantly less which is an indication of lower solar activity. This results in the earth receiving less power per square meter. This in itself will cause cooling but, less activity also means that the earth will receive more cosmic radiation which creates more clouds which will reflect more sun light. Experts range in their opinion to the extent and time frame of cooling from anything from a Dalton minimum  to a Little Ice Age.  The cooling will continue for 30 to 50 years before there is a rebound but the rebound is not supposed to be has high as it has been and then it will plummet lower. That is my reason for believing in planet cooling. Could you tell me why you think it is going to get warmer? Let me add that getting cooler has the potential of causing much more harm than getting warmer. I forgot to mention that during times of solar minimums there is an increase in volcanic action probably due to the sun's magnetic field directly influencing our core.

The Sun is the biggest effect on our climate The \nmagnetic field of the earth and gravity. As I write this other planets \nare going through weather changes and man is not there. Fact water is a \ngreenhouse gas which I do not know why these people do not mention it. \nProof..... ever heard of humidity? Or the humidex factor to temperature?\n Another fact most of the weather data at ground level is done near \ncities. Hense concrete jungles hold onto heat as in they heat up so does\n metal. Walk on a road then walk on grass in your bare feet. . big \ntemperature change.. Oh one more thing the sun is going through a cycle \nwhere the sun spots are getting smaller in numbers when that happens the\n earths climate does change a lot. This is also the beginning of a mini \nice age when the sun does this. Also Artic Ice has been melting for the \nlast 50,000 years or longer.  The Earth also has a Axis Wobble. As in \noour planets axis changes a few degrees it may not seem like much but it\n will effect our weather. Fact is we need more C02. It may look weird to\n say it but with more trees can convert it and absorb the carbon. Just \nin case you cant see it but agriculture needs C02 Do you actually think \nour food that is grown does not need C02 for food itself. In other \nwords. All this climate change stuff is focusing on Carbon and nothing \nelse. We are tropical creatures hense why we evolved out of a tropical \narea.

Until an asteroid said hi and paid a visit.\n\nJust saying if one thinks its just man and nothing else at all can \neffect our temperature.

Thats why I do not trust \nmost of these so called climate people because they do not focus on all \nvariables.

When the Earth's temperature changes - there's a cause, and the goal of science is to understand the cause.    Earth's climate isn't \"Always changing\" it changes periodically, coinciding with forces that drive the change.   This is really basic.   \n\nIf there is a cause that's driving an effect, then we have to ask, how bad is the effect?  Is it in our interest to address the cause?   This is prevention vs cure.  It's also really basic.\n\nWhat Walter said is \"happened throughout history\" ignores the why and it ignores the effect.   When climate was different 20,000 years ago 1/3rd of America and most of Canada was under a mile of ice?    Do you want that?   Do you think that would be a good chance?   Or Neutral?     By not asking \"what will happen\" and not asking \"Why is it happening\", Walter is punting education out the window, content with \"Well it's changed before - shoulder shrug\" - implying so what.\n\nWalter is wrong.   100%.   It has nothing to do with indoctrination.   It has to do with education and facing reality and understanding that cause and effect are real and worth studying and that it's in all of our best interest to have some basic understanding of this.\n\nDo you hate the truth that much?   Do you hate the future that much?\n\nThe Romans didn't live in a \"Much Warmer\" period than we do now.

Chernobyl (not Chernobil) was a failure of the Soviet Union to be sensible, they used a reactor design that is inherently likely to run away and melt down, did not listen to the engineers that wanted to delay the test and knew the reactor better than the exec, and also designed the reactor to be able to produce bomb grade material (plutonium) hence the design being scary similar to one that can be refueled on the fly for plutonium extraction. \n\nFukushima still has a low death toll, a singular wind turbine caught on fire and killed a handful of workers, this turbine (this happened more than once in different places so pick any one of them) has less power capacity in a given year than Fukushima did so not only did it kill more than Fukushima but it also generated less power so the kills to power ratios are way in favor of nuclear.

It is a fact, and a menace.\nI grant without further ado that the official government list of \"renewable energy\" ought to be thrown in the trash. \nHydro is dispatchable, but not good for river life. \nGeothermal is marvelous, if you live near the Ring of Fire. The rest is rubbish.\nNuclear power is THE alternative, and the fossil fuel folk know it and fear it.\n\nBut global warming is caused by gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, although carbon tetrahydride leaks are tens of times worse. They trap and keep, instead of letting it escape, the energy of the weak infrared photons that surfaces at reasonably comfortable temperatures emit.\nThat is a few ten-thousandths of the energy with which the Sun irradiates our planet. But if only 99.98% of that energy escapes back to outer space, guess what? The Earth gets hotter. Day and night, year after year, that is a lot of energy. Melted snow and ice represent a very great deal of heat, and so does the uppermost thousand feet of the oceans, at a mere tenth of a degree hotter. Cold water feels far colder than air at the same temperature, and if it's a breeze blowing, you're probably being cooled by slight evaporation from your sweat glands, even if you don't notice.\n\nWind turbines are a feeble thing compared with the Tall Ships, and the both they and the sail-driven Men-o'War were swept from the seas by coal.\nChina has the answer, and it isn't the filthy mess they make supplying rare earth metals for the \"renewables\" trade. See the Daily Mail item on Bautou.\n\nThe answer is a diverse field of advanced nuclear fission technologies, the two best  of which were successfully demonstrated in the USA before the disgraceful Chernobyl meltdown, or the Tohoku earthquake disaster. No, Fukushima's reactors were a grievous loss, but the killed nobody.

We have the advantage at this stage of knowing there has been no upward trend if not a small downward trend in temps. Predicted ice loss and movements have been totally wrong. Economic impacts on those that can least afford it is alarming. It has however brought about the political climate that has been desired in that we are increasingly more socially dependant. That's the one we are pursuing with a vengeance.

We the lemmings find it complex and those that have studied and disagree find they are insulted and ostracised as the new world religion gets significant traction. I will now say something that will bring howls of condemnation and derision. It is however accurate. Gods word says that in the last days, we will worship the creation instead of the Creator. Indeed evolution, a theory that only makes sense if you have been drinking heavily, is now a fact. If a student disagrees he/she is marked down as a result.

Virtually all peer reviewed scientific research done on climate change since the 60's agree with the premises of its reality and the source is industry and agriculture by humans. Please be careful of what you read on the internet, check the sources, check what's in the scientific litterature, don't take everything you read on blogs at face value especially when it contradicts something that is taught in schools and have been common basic knowledge for decades. No climate change isn't a conspiracy. I know it's hard to get a clear view of the world because everything is complicated and all, but don't fall in the logical fallacy of thinking because it's complicated then anything and everything can be true and you can just believe anything you want. I think this is the problem with the internet nowadays, anyone can pick and choose whatever they want to be true and find a comunity to agree with them and echo their beliefs, no matter how ridiculous they are. In the end as the earth gets warmer and warmer, the deniers are going to feel very alone in a world where everyone will be trying to fix the problem, and they will keep saying 'no no it can't happen', and noone will listen to them anymore.

If you're living every day like it might be your last, making peace where you can, putting self-awareness first, then you're likely doing all you can. You're stepping out of an extremely punishing economic system, both for humans and other creatures on the planet. People often think the earth is a dead, inorganic thing from which living things arise. What if the earth, itself, is a living sentient 'being' of a different order, a planetary order; what if we're guests and it's the host? Maybe it's decided our jig is up. We've become more like an infection now, and a planetary 'fever' is the response. Human beings only pretend to be nice to each other to avoid negative consequences or for self-gain. They are vicious animals that think nothing of enslaving/ running rough shod over one another. They behave ruthlessly and rapaciously in the name of profit, are greedy and petty. A few of them own almost everything, while a great many go hungry or without. And to a greater or lesser extent we as individuals are complicit. Let me state that another way: none of us are innocent. Ignorant perhaps, but not innocent. In our collective vanity we somehow think we can survive, but our time on this globe is likely limited in spite of what we do now (that doesn't mean we shouldn't try). If so, the thing to do is to make harmony and spread peace wherever we can, and stop punishing others as well as ourselves. Most of all stay present, and worry less.

What can man do IF in fact we are facing a serious climate change situation?  Again, especially IF the SUN plays any part in this equation.  Yes, I understand CO2 in the atmosphere.  Who’s to say that the CO2 levels are bad or good?  What is the optimum level of CO2 in the atmosphere?  A more serious question might be what is the SUN doing?  Is it cooling, expanding, spotting,  ect.  What really could we do about all this and when.Yes, I also believe the oil/coal and gas are limited resources and that using ALL of them in a relative short period is not a good thing.  But again, I have to ask myself what can man do?   I’m trying to think outside the box here. I’ve seen some outrageous ideals long ago on the subject.  For example, “growing algae in the desert”\nfor Bio fuel.  Not only does this reverse CO2 in the atmosphere but also produces fuel for cars.  What is a smart thing both left and right can\nagree on?  How can we balance curbing our appetite for cheap fuel, EPA clean power plans, and NOT repeating error like Solyndra.\nI hope both sides of the climate change debate can agree to work\ntogether and temper everything with a bit of common sense and science.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Donald Hughes", "channel": "UCl_eSjEES64SfTz_KlabNXA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRNe2Zlu68b6v6u3xIQnpUDEN2nnKDaueDY9_ECWRw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Thank you by the way, I’ll keep an eye on that site above.  I have two separate takeaways,  as my first impressions of this site.  Please read BOTH below.\n\nFirst, here is my problem.  In the first few moments in the video, I hear that “flood insurance in Minnesota tripled over the last 20 years”.   So it gets me thinking and searching the internet for more information.   For example, I’m asking myself, what has the population done over the past 20 years?  What has the median home values in Minnesota for past 20 years?  Both are easily up.  I also see lakeshore properties are increasing.  So I decide there are no clear irrefutable facts here. The climate change folks need to provide better science in general here.  The issue comes across as how someone feels about it. We need more FACTS.\n\nBut wait there is more…\n\nI did learn about “urban heat islands” also in this video.  I’m reading the wiki on “urban heat islands” and doing more studying here.  This “urban heat islands” is one I’ve not heard anything about.  I have often felt the effects of it myself but it really never registered as anything of a concern.  It makes clear sense to me and has been studied since the 1800’s I read.  Wow, now there is some science and “green” in that “urban heat islands” that I could easily get behind and support. This is the type of information we need more of. Thanks again.\n\nI’ve become interested lately over this topic because of the President-elect Trump 2016 winning.  Trump recently meet with Al Gore.  I strongly despise Al Gore.  I do like Trump.  I also like that Trump is listening to Al Gore.  I sincerely hope that President Trump finds the correct agenda for Climate Change or green initiatives.

{"cid": "UgjQ3y-w0_jRRngCoAEC.8KxvNKSAigo8M-iQiS-rFt", "text": "Martin Hearn \nWell it's great that you agree with NOAA's research because none of it points to human caused carbon emissions raising Earth's temperatures by any significant amount.\nIt's also interesting that you ignore the fact that ocean's aren't creating all of the O2. Plants (being over 98% of them) cannot exist without photosynthesis whose byproduct is O2. Carbon gas saturation is quite high but this benefits large plants on land as well as plankton in the ocean's and algae in lakes and swamps all over the planet. Why? Because these plants need carbon to keep photosynthesis functioning smoothly. The increased carbon saturation is benefiting plants and has sparked increases in plant growth.\n\nIt's also interesting that you completely ignored my post looking at satellite reliability. Personally I thought satellite data was too low resolution, but apparently their just completely incompetent as measuring tools according to the people in the video I linked yesterday.\nIt's fascinating that we have approximately forty thousand weather stations most of which are in human cities and farmland including the nearly six thousand ocean bouys... For MILLIONS OF CUBIC MILES OF OCEANS!\nAlaska alone is over 1 million square miles of land and how many weather stations do they have? 30? 300?\nRadar isn't exactly a good thermometer (it's actually a damn terrible thermometer)!\n\nRecap: plants on land contribute to atmospheric O2 levels quite a bit, NOAA's data and climatologists are undecided about what causes abrupt climate change but are pretty certain that humans didn't cause any of the changes in the 80,000+ years depicted by ice core research, and satellites are pure crap or absolutely vital to proving global warming is real or a total overreaction depending on who you're listening to at any given moment.\nBasically the only concrete data we really can all agree on is that CO2 levels are rising and as I mentioned CO is what is pumped into the air not CO2. Catalytic converters don't turn CO into CO2 magically. There's a fair bit of CO in automotive emissions (all vehicle types except full electric and hydrogen fueled vehicles). Carbon gas regardless of atomic configuration is significantly heavier than air which is how it will always finds its way to our ocean's and is absorbed by plankton which then metabolize it as these sometimes single-celled organisms process the gas they can also replicate themselves. This can be a driving force in algae blooms. Unfortunately algae blooms are too big to be consumed as a result these creatures die and sink in huge heaps to the ocean floors. This by the way is where the pH increasing carbon is likely coming from.\nBut their's another snag in the US some companies aren't allowed to pump very much carbon gas into the atmosphere... In the US carbon emissions are taxed a lot! It's not in big industries best interests to pump out so much carbon gases. In America the emissions are slowly declining and yet the carbon saturation keeps climbing.\nWe're doing our part tye rest if the world isn't and there isn't a damn thing you or I can do about it. The icing on the cake is that carbon emissions don't seem to be directly impacting the temperature globally. Remember satellite data is showing cooling which is inaccurate because of friction in LEO which is also affecting total orbital velocity and temperature collection timings allegedly. So what are the global averages as measured by everywhere on Earth?\n\nNo climatologists have an answer!\n\nGlobal warming right now is as real as God in the sense that we can't prove or disprove it's existence in any conclusive manner. As I said loads of anecdotal evidences and research that we don't have nearly enough data points all satiating confirmation bias on either side.\nThe pundits are talking the businesses are actually fixing the issues and the data still suggests nothing is changing while cities grow and resources become more scarce the media perpetually reminds the weak minded that this is all the fault of a gas that is being cut out of modern western industrial emissions!\nDo I need to go on?", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "VariantAEC", "channel": "UCEPbBgYc8f0QiGfZE_fRO9g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT2Gk0VuktwXyzKqVkh2Q5_fgg9rFWWg9od5nUQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Some are very strict and don't allow for much waste to escape their confines and some don't care much about where their waste goes. However no matter how a company monitors it's waste once it leaves their sight the buck is passed to another corporation that will have slightly different ways of monitoring and treating the waste.\nIt's exactly the same as throwing out your garbage and waiting for the trash truck! What happens after your own trash leaves the curb is likely unknown to you.\nEven if you work in waste treatment or recycling you don't know who will buy the recycled goods or how they will monitor their waste.\n\nIt's pretty interesting when you look at the bigger picture.

How would you like to limit the very things your cereal, headsets, phones, games, sterile medical equipment among a huge variety of other things come packaged in or are made out of?\nInstead more incentives for recycling need to be found. Plastics aren't recyclable. I always find myself asking why not? Most of the plastic things we own were made using injection molding... That means the plastic was melted down there are bits and pieces that get cut off or shaved down. In almost all cases this excess or waste is melted back down and reused until there is too little left. So most of the plastics in our electronics could be reused, however it simply isn't.\nAlso plastics aren't the enemy of the environment. People are. It's like arguing that guns kill people. They don't until an another person loads a bullet into the chamber aims it at someone and pulls the trigger.\nIf one company turns a decent profit by recycling excess waste it's probability of catching on will increase by leaps and bounds.\nPeople on an individual level are also part of the problem.

Regardless of how concrete my data is, everybody understands that locking your car, locking your door, and having an alarm helps to change the probabilities in your favour to protect you from loss.  Theft is unknowable, and because it is knowable, you choose the action that makes the assumption that theft will eventually happen and lock your house/car.  The same applies to investing.  Many understand that performance of stocks are unknowable, DESPITE data collected from stock markets, complicated algorithms, and measure of risk.  People spread their investments, and shift their investments increasingly to more conservative investments as they get older because A) no one knows when the big losses are going to come, and B) the older you are, the less time you have recover from loss.  The situation with the environment and climate is no different from investing.  The climate, like the stock market has its surprises, and the farther in time models project, the bigger the error.  However, we do know that CO2, regardless of source is the source of the greenhouse effect.  We have an example in nature other than the Earth - its Venus.  It has the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closest to the Sun.  Venus is the endstate of any planet with an atmosphere where CO2 reaches a certain concentration.  Air samples in ice cores show CO2 peaks in concentrations correlating to volcanic eruptions over tens of thousands of years, and we see a general rise in CO2 after the Industrial Revolution.   The surface temperature AVERAGE has not moved much but the DIFFERENCE in surface temperatures has increased which indicated a general rise in energy introduced into the atmosphere.  We may not have concrete data on where all the carbon comes from, and we may not have enough thermometers to get more accurate models, however, its clear we as a race don't know where the point of danger lies, yet we do see evidence that carbon emissions can cause problems.  So I ask, is it WISE to assume nothing is wrong and keep doing what we are doing?  Let me leave you with this final point.

The data I provided you with is that which indicates \"the whole world's\" temperature but it clearly isn't. The averages are what's changing not the total difference in highs and lows. The temperature from day to day is highly variable and as an average based on the stations it is increasing. Based on the satellite data the global temperature is decreasing. Based on a single video I was able to find the satellite data is inaccurate, but I couldn't find anyone who agrees with the content of the video stating satellite data is inaccurate. The land based weather stations are in highly urban areas most of the stations are at metropolitan airports. Perhaps it's a coincidence that airports have higher CO2 concentrations? I mean who am I kidding jet engines don't emit any CO2 at all!!!\n\nPeople don't know where the data comes from... Most don't care and this is a pretty big problem because the data the media uses is pushing a global warming agenda. There have been studies suggesting that the added CO2 is actually good for living plants. The more unbelievable studies suggest that the added CO2 will stave off another \"little ice-age\".\nThe more reasonable data backed by tried and true observations and scale experiments suggest that humans would ned to add several orders of magnitude more CO2 emissions than we do now to adjust the temperature by a few F° and that it would put the CO2 concentration to intolerable levels (would make animals sick and possibly kill via a very slow kind of suffocation). The thing is as CO2 concentrations rise the temperatures actually stabilize because only some wavelengths of light from the sun will attenuate and only to a certain degree before losing its energy. It the temperatures can only keep climbing if the atmosphere fills with other forms of gas. Hey doesn't Venus have loads of methane in it's atmosphere? Why yes it does. Methane is worse than CO2... Want to know what's worse than methane and CO2 combined? Water vapor. That's right simple water vapor increases air temperatures far more than CO2 or Methane. You would need suffocating clouds of Methane and CO2 and still not wind up with the same amount of light to heat converting power of atomized water!\nSo far those studies have proved pretty accurate even on very large scales - like in Earth's atmosphere.\nIt's warmer in winter without any wind and dense cloud cover than without wind and without cloud cover. The ambient humidity drives temperatures up. Concrete and pavement hold onto the converted light energy of the sun and slowly release heat all throughout the night artificially driving temperatures up...

The lesson here is you make a decision in the face of incomplete data where the outcome is in your favor.  That's it, nothing more to read into it.  Nobody knows for certain what will happen with high confidence because the system is so bloody complex.  Data is meaningless.  It doesn't matter, because the wise course of action IS to cut down on carbon emissions.  Life existed at lower concentrations of CO2, and it existed for over 3 billion years without man doing its civilization experiment.  That we know.  What we dont know is what things will look like at 800ppm or 950ppm.  The concentration CANNOT go on forever.  Nobody knows where the danger point is, it is all speculation.  So in this case, where nobody knows the future, but you know that there are limits and things are approaching those limits, do you just do nothing?  I don't trust models of either the climate scientist or of the climate denier.  All I care about is the potential risk.  Do nothing, nothing may happen, or things go to hell and we learn of the point of danger AFTER THE FACT, or, we make choices, make investments, and manage our carbon emissions to keep the levels in a zone where we know life has existed.  The burden of any proof lies with the climate deniers because of the simple fact life existed for a very long time without the influence Civilization and its emissions.  Mankind and its civilization is the one that is running the experiment, that is living in a way completely alien to the way any other creature has biologically evolved.  We have no other planets we can observe that have creature like us, running industries like us, to know what will truly happen.  We will never have the data needed, and we will never truly know where the point of danger will come.  What we do know is the planet is finite, the atmosphere is finite, our resources are finite, CO2 traps heat and the ppm of CO2 is building.

The truth is, nobody wants to do anything because its going to represent changes to peoples lives and they simply don't want to think about it.  Data is not the problem - we all know deep down what the proper and WISE course of action is, its just that we cannot imagine what life would be like in a non-carbon future because we are too comfortable with the current situation.

The temperatures from rural stations should be relatively flat (unchanged averages).

If these zones show no significant increases in average temperature then global warming itself must be false.

When you correct for any UHI, there's still statistically significant surface warming and most of the observed surface warming remains; so the UHI does not work as an explanation of the observed surface warming. And there wasn't really a statistically significant difference in the warming trend between rural American stations that AGW denialists like Antony Watts like, and stations denialists don't like.\n\nHere are some scientific research papers to get you started, providing evidence for the points I made above about the UHI and temperature rise:\n\n\"Influence of Urban Heating on the Global Temperature Land Average using Rural Sites Identified from MODIS classifications\"\n\"Global rural temperature trends\"\n\"Quantifying the effect of urbanization on U.S. Historical Climatology Network temperature records\"\n\"Earth Atmospheric Land Surface Temperature and Station Quality in the Contiguous United States\"\n\"Urban heat island effects on estimates of observed climate change\"\n\"A Demonstration That Large-Scale Warming Is Not Urban\"\n\"Assessment of Urban Versus Rural In Situ Surface Temperatures in the Contiguous United States: No Difference Found\"\n\"Urban and rural temperature trends in proximity to large US cities: 1951–2000\"\n\"Urbanization effects in large-scale temperature records, with an emphasis on China\"\n\"Urbanization-related warming in local temperature records: a review\"\n\"Evaluating the impact of U.S. Historical Climatology Network homogenization using the U.S. Climate Reference Network\"\n\"On the reliability of the U.S. surface temperature record\"\n\"Urbanization Effects on Observed Surface Air Temperature Trends in North China\"\n\n\nSo how about you drop your denialism, and actually change your position in response to the evidence?\n\n\"It is, however, important not to confuse denialism with genuine scepticism, which is essential for scientific progress.

Define rural.\nHow do you correct for the heat island effect?\n\nI love how you posted a link to BMJ which is a medical journal for a completely unrelated issue but were completely incapable of doing the same for the other documents the first one I'm certain another person linked to already and it didn't make much sense at all. Rural and remote are I guess to different things. How do we know temperatures in areas without thermometers are getting warmer?\nWell, weather satellites right? NOPE! See according to the titles of articles found with search engines indicates the data is all over the place.\nSearch \"Weather satellites show cooling\" or \"weather satellites show warming\" and the resulting article titles show strong contradictions.\nThere are a lot of sites that claim the world is warming and others that say it's cooling. NOAA and NASA studies that show warming are easily searched, but those that show otherwise are buried but still available for public viewing. I didn't look at this thread but I have posted links to many of these studies in YouTube threads before.\nI really don't feel like dragging this out or finding the links again and reposting them right now.\nI did look at a few studies today that claim warming while ignoring many urban locations that are listed as rural claiming they figured what considered urban or rural by satellite data... How? That much is not discussed. I have big problems with that especially seeing as how many urban zones aren't covered by the map they used as reference.\nThere are also far less stations in locations far more likely to be hot like deserts. It's a flawed way to collect temperatures. They used temperature averages but ignore the simple fact that the weather stations are at airports in growing cities in areas where temperatures are already higher and then claim the world is getting hotter faster!\nNot a joke.\nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GISSTemperature/giss_temperature.php\nPage 4 is really interesting though. Looking at the final image which shows the difference in average temperatures from the year 2006 compared to 1951-1980 temperatures are much higher in places people don't live...\nWhy are temperatures going up where all human activity isn't?\nHow can Hansen claim humans are the source of the increases when the things we knew that caused problems were removed from our atmosphere?\nHow odd that he has no answers? Yet he also admits that there was a completely unexplained cooling trend from 1940-1970... He chalks that up to \"natural variability\"! Can you believe it!?\nSo if the temperature goes down it's natural but when it goes up its our fault even when the things we claim to know cause temperatures to rise aren't a factor?\nBut global warming is real...\nPardon my ability to look at the data, see the flaws in their methodology and notice the hypocrisy in their reasoning.\nThe \"best of the best\" are confused. I don't see how and I don't see the same trends they are. What would convince me is a restart. There are too many data points to keep reevaluating with preconceived bias. If we throw that all away (by setting up simple remote stations in uninhabited areas for 5-10 years) we can start seeing weather or not temperatures are actually increasing. Will that data prove global warming? No, but it will at least indicate without a doubt that warming is occurring in an unbiased way without direct human causes.\nIf the data shows warming in legitimately remote locations then we would know something is going on. Even so humanity is cutting back on carbon emissions and CFCs are pretty much non-existent these days which is why acid rain is far less of an issue and the ozone is recovering.\n\nhttp://www.wri.org/blog/2014/05/history-carbon-dioxide-emissions\n\nSo here's another thing to consider especially when looking at carbon emissions. In NA carbon emissions are less than they have been in the recent past. Of course now China is the biggest contributor to C02 and other greenhouse gas emissions. China according to this report is responsible for 31% of all greenhouse gas emissions! Just China all by itself... Nearly one third of all known harmful gas emissions come from a small fraction or a percent of that nations cities... Yet the temperatures haven't increased drastically in China over major cities according to satellite data. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!?\nIt begs the question: if 1/3 of all the world's annual greenhouse gasses come from this place and that countries output literally exploded in a couple of decades, then why hasn't the temperature increased significantly in and around that area?", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "VariantAEC", "channel": "UCEPbBgYc8f0QiGfZE_fRO9g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT2Gk0VuktwXyzKqVkh2Q5_fgg9rFWWg9od5nUQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Temperature increases of even the last 14 years. Here's NASA satellite data which is the Only truly global temperature record for the planet, produced by 2 climate scientists (one a former lead scientist for the IPCC, and the other a former NASA scientist):\n\nhttp://drroyspencer.com/latest-global-temperatures/\n\nI'm writing this in December 2016, so the graph currently ends November 2016. Over the last 37 years, temperature has increased 0.7C. Whoopee! We're frying! (Not!) During the time period I mentioned in my opening comment -- the end of the Younger Dryas -- global temperatures shot up as much as 7.0C in 30 years! That's 10x faster and in a shorter period of time. And that made civilization possible.\n\n\"...we humans have spiked that change into hyperdrive...\" If you look at the work of Alley (2000), his GISP2 ice core temperature proxies show that the Holocene has had 10 warm periods, 1 every 1,000 years or so. That's 10 natural warm periods; not 9 natural and 1 human+CO2. Yes, you acknowledged that nature still plays a part, but here's the kicker on this data: the Modern Warm Period is the Coolest of the 10 warm periods! Not only that, the trend for the last 3,000 years has been strongly toward cooling. When you take the deep and broad cold of the Little Ice Age (between the far warmer Medieval Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period), these facts suggest that the Holocene has already started to shut down in favor of the next glacial period of the current Ice Age. The work of W.S. Broecker (1998) shows that our Holocene interglacial (warm phase of an Ice Age) is already older than average and overdue to end. So, you're wrong. The Modern Warm Period warming is not spectacular; in fact, it's substandard.\n\nMedieval Warm Period warmer than today? Yes! Even in 2016, we still can't grow crops where the Vikings did in Greenland. We still can't grow wine grapes in England where the Medieval farmers could. During the far warmer Holocene Optimum, the Sahara was green, because plentiful rain made deserts more scarce or smaller.\n\nDo we humans create problems with the environment? You bet we do. Publicly trade corporations are evil and will always be selfish. And you still get your news and science from them? Tsk, tsk.\n\nI used to be on your side of the fence, and then discovered that Al Gore and I had been horribly wrong. Did I hit my head against the wall to wake up to this new realization?

Read the book \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\" by Yuval Noah Harari to gain some insight at how the human species have already changed the face of this planet, driven many species to extinction and might very well within the next 100 years make the planet unsuitable habitat for any mammals. Many think of progress as what we define as our western lifestyles, but fail to regard all the external costs of our lives, the extremely high energy usage per person, the suffering of people at the bottom and ruining the planets biodiversity. Clearly overpopulation is a big part of this as there are so many of us around now to consume the planets scarce resources at increasing rates. Surely if everybody on the planet lived like the average western person it would likely have been all over by now. I believe David Puttnam conveys this challenge very clearly in his talk as we strive to make everybody consume as westerners without any regard to the external costs to our planet and all lifes habitats (including our own). Club of Rome basically said all this in the book \"Limits to Growth\" over 40 years ago and what we are seeing now is basically one of their scenarios playing out when many of the consequences form a perfect storm. I believe what we need to focus on is figuring out how to handle the fall as gracefully as possible, hopefully with technology that can sustain some of the burden of change - but it's one where it will be hard for anyone to choose to take part of it since it certainly means living with less for everybody.

Certainly it has enabled us things that wasn't possible even to the point of creating people like Elon Musk which is actually fighting for a plan B for the human species by colonizing another planet.

I am convinced it is a matter of perception and that warmists live in a fantasy where they refuse to look at the evidence (which is all around them) that would threaten their fantasy world, and even if they do look at it they don't really see it. I had a very brief look at your channel and nothing I saw there surprised me. Political correctness is the \"meta fantasy\" that all the individual fantasies exist in. From my point of view, looking at AGW as a discrete historical phenomenon, it is an obvious delusion and it has many of the characteristics of other mass delusions (of which there are quite a few) including hysteria, emotionalism, 'group think' and deceit. I would recommend to anyone looking for an insight into what I am talking about to look at the website of the late Richard Webster, Sceptical Essays. He deals largely with modern day witch hunts in the form of paedophile ring scares. From my own observations I see that extraverted behaviour is highly significant. (For example, extraverts tend to look for rationalizations for their opponents' positions in cliched motivations such as trying to make money out of it ('bought by the fossil fuel industries', attention seeking, 'pushing the agenda of vested interests' or just some mysterious quality of 'stupidity' or even 'badness'. I was recently accused, in a different but related context, of 'seeking to muddy the waters', whatever that means.) I would be amazed if you were not an extravert. By the way, the term 'denialists' does not really have a place in reasoned debate, particularly since the denial is all on your own side. By the way, I got my original insights into extraverts from Dorothy Rowe, an Australian psychologist.I recently read a fascinating book by Christopher Booker, The Neophiliacs, who explained the strange cultural irruption that brought about the 'Fab Sixties' as a fantasy, using a five-stage fantasy cycle. He wrote an excellent history of the AGW fantasy (The Real Climate Disaster) within this implicit framework.

{"cid": "UgjuERKcPX8KIXgCoAEC.8HZodDOhEfc8MffTaJKDnJ", "text": "+John Brookes, how could anyone not believe as you do? It's simple really. I used to believe as you do. That was me 5 years ago. What changed? Someone took the time, with patience and cordial data, to show how I was wrong. The emphasis wasn't on making me wrong. There was no name calling.\n\nFeeling strongly about our planet and the future of humanity is a good thing. But you have to be armed with all the facts. If you have preconceived ideas, it makes it far harder for you to get new information. That's the \"full cup\" that needs to be emptied with humility.\n\nClimate has been changing for nearly 4.5 billion years, but someone has made it suddenly \"new,\" \"dangerous\" and \"man made.\" But is it really? We see all the pollution going on in the world. Disgusting. We see all the corporate criminality and wonder when that will stop. And as corrupt as corporations are, we still get our news and science from those same corrupt corporations (hint, hint). Even the universities are corrupted by corporate money.\n\nBut let's look at the climate itself. Look at the following facts and see if you can find any fault with any of it. Provide sources or a detailed explanation for any disagreements you may have about it.\n\nFact: We live in an ongoing Ice Age. Just look at Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nFact: Global Warming made civilization possible 12,000 years ago. Did you know that the warming back then was +7C in 30 years? That's about 8x the current UN \"scare story\" which hasn't happened yet.\n\nFact: Our Modern Warm Period is a natural cycle coming out of the Little Ice Age.\n\nFact: The Holocene interglacial (warm phase of an Ice Age) has had 10 warm periods, 1 every 1,000 years or so (Ref: Alley, 2000). That's 10 natural warm periods; not 9 natural and 1 human+CO2. If CO2 were the driving force, our Modern Warm Period should be far warmer than it is (see next fact).\n\nFact: The Modern Warm Period is cooler than the Medieval Warm Period. Michael Mann and the Climate Gate scientists tried to rub it out of existence with their Hockey Stick fraud, but we know from history that Vikings grew crops in Greenland where we cannot grow them now. Medieval farmers grew wine grapes in England where they will not grow today.\n\nFact: CO2 is at starvation levels. Thirty million years ago, when CO2 levels dropped down to 800 ppm (2x today's), plants freaked out and evolved C4 species to cope with the CO2 starvation.\n\nFact: CO2 is far closer to extinction levels than it is to the Norm. About 15,000 BC, CO2 levels dropped to within 30 ppm of Lovelock's \"Red Line\" of extinction (Ref: \"Red Line - Carbon Dioxide,\" Martin, 2016). We almost lost 85% of all plant species and nearly 99% of all food crop species. Imagine never having coffee, toast, pasta, beans, oranges, apples and nearly every other plant-based food you eat. The average for the last 600 million years was 1,600 ppm (4x today's).\n\nFact: Temperature response to CO2 increases is logarithmic and we've already gone past the saturation level at 400 ppm.\n\nFact: Global Warming is good, because we're in an Ice Age.\n\nFact: Global Warming produces far fewer and weaker storms. Wind blows because of temperature differences. You can see this by looking at the rising air from a fire. Eliminate the temperature difference, and that same air would not rise, and other air would not move in from the side to take its place. Global cooling will move polar cold closer to equatorial heat, making storms more frequent and more violent (Ref: H. Lamb, CRU; especially see his work on Little Ice Age storms).\n\nFact: Global Warming produces fewer droughts and smaller deserts. Rain doesn't happen by magic. It comes from warming of water and evaporation. During the far warmer Holocene Optimum, the Sahara was green for nearly 3,000 years. Today's wimpy Lake Chad was, back then, a robust inland sea rivaling the Caspian in its heyday.\n\nThere are a lot more facts that support the non-AGW viewpoint. In fact, I've written two books on the topic. But I recommend you reign in your disgust and do some study.

The ice age cycle has been going for about 3 million years, so not very long at all geologically.  But on the other hand, it is a  long time compared to how long humans have been on earth, and especially compared to how long civilisation has been around.\n\nIf we were in any real danger of returning to the glacial part of the ice age cycle any time soon, I'd be recommending the burning of as much fossil fuel as would be needed to avoid it. It would be a massive disaster.\n\nThe reason that the magical \"2 degrees C\" was chosen as the temperature increase to avoid is that when the world was consistently this warm, there was no ice, and sea levels were consequently a lot higher.  This too would be a disaster. \n\nI'm pretty sure that either of these disasters would put severe strain on civilisation.\n\nIn the end, I'm just in favour of avoiding disaster and saving civilisation.

Most people aren't designing - and then making - the next Cadillac Escalade. So even IF they were convinced - so what? They don't have the power to do anything about it anyway. Besides - not everyone [and that includes ME] is convinced that 'man' is entirely responsible.\n\nThat said... If I were in charge I would focus my attention on packaging. That's right... what those things we buy come packaged in. I'm a single guy. And the amount of cardboard and plastic wrap and containers that I throw away and/or recycle every month is a joke. Everything we buy should be wrapped in as little as possible. Consider a box of Cheerios. Does it really need to come in a big cardboard box? How many trees and how much pollution is being created just to attract our attention while walking buy the cereal section of a grocery store? It's silly. And consider those 'free' weekly community newspapers that end up at our door once or twice a week - whether we want them or not. How many trees are sacrificed for something that could just as easily be posted online? \n\n\"Give a hoot! Don't pollute!\" Was a big national anti-pollution campaign that began in 1971. It has since died off. But can you think of the last time you heard anyone say, \"Don't litter!\" There was also a TV commercial referred to as, 'The Crying Indian'. It featured a Native Indian man with a tear rolling down his cheek because he was surrounded by litter.

{"cid": "Uggxp2Zgtbj_LHgCoAEC.89Gzt9G3eqZ8UyZiVzoE0u", "text": "TheWalterSamuel21 \nFirst off I am really sorry I mixed up pole and polar, since in german we call it \"Nordpol , Südpol\". \n--I don't believe you are German. You may be, but there is no way to be sure and no way for you to prove it definitively. I simply do not trust you. You are free not to trust me if you wish\n\nSo since you have so many sources I will give you some aswell. Polars not melting significantly since 1979: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/05/19/updated-nasa-data-polar-ice-not-receding-after-all/#674d4a5b2892 \n--This is a misleading opinion piece, not a reviewed work of science. It was written by James McBee Taylor, the president of \"Spark of Freedom Foundation\" an organization that is closely tied to the \"Heartland Institute\", which, itself is a oil funded disinformation clearinghouse. Forbes is a financial magazine, not a scientific resource. Forbes is also a publication that has become rather infamous for \"pay to publish\" articles. Anyone can publish articles in Forbes, no matter how incorrect, misleading or slanted the articles may be as long as they have the money. Many unscrupulous people have done so over the last few years - I've seen it. \nIf you want a true and honest representation of the science, you MUST go to the people performing the science- the scientists. That you do not know this is telling. In my travels I have found that Germans have very ordered minds and place a high value on logic. You do not, so I don't trust you\n\nAnother one on the CO2/Temperature correlation: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/05/19/updated-nasa-data-polar-ice-not-receding-after-all/#674d4a5b2892 \n---this is the same link. \n\nThe climate changes and that is inevitable people like Al Gore are profiting on this making billions.\n--Al Gore is a US politician and an old one at that. He was Vice President going on 18 years ago now. He's not that well known in Germany. You do not argue facts here. You replace facts with demagoguery. Al Gore is worth $200 million, not billions. And that he is very wealthy (like so many politicians these days) is irrelevant to the facts regarding climate change. Howard Hughes made quite a bit of money on warplanes. That he did is a irrelevant to the threat that was posed by Hitler. \n\n\"but the fact is that this a normal occurence and the media today just makes the most out of it with butthurt prophecies.\"\n--\"butthurt\" is a term that you don't hear too many Germans use either. In fact it's really recent American slang that boys who like Pepe the Frog and frequent Reddit use. \n\nNow I want to justify my statement from the last post: \"We are talking about numbers like 0,005 degrees , makes no difference at all. \" Since 1880 the temperature has risen by a shocking 0.8 celsius , expert say that 5% of this is due to our increased output of CO2, do the math 0,04 degress thanks to us 0,005 or 0,004 not so far of mate.\n--I doubt you will do this, but show me specifically where \"experts say that 5% of this is due to our increased output of CO2\" - in context. Do you trust the experts for this fact (if it is indeed a fact) but not other facts? Do you pick and choose what facts you want to believe?\nIt's all so very simple - When my parents were born (about 1930), the world had about 2 billion people on it. When I was born (1961) the world had 3 billion people on it. Now the world has 7.4 billion people on. That's exponential growth. As the human population has grown, our use of coal and oil and natural gas has grown too. CO2 emissions have also grown. Humans are now emitting more CO2 than they ever have. \nCO2 ask like a blanket or a coat. CO2 acts like insulation. The extra layer of insulation that we are adding in our atmosphere is going to hold in more heat exactly as it would if you stood in the sun in a heavy coat. The experts you cited before say that the temperature will rise 2°C to 6°C by the end of the century.  But like I said, you seem to want to pick and choose what facts you want to believe\n\n\n \"you think more CO2 =higher temperature - which is out of context completly.\"\n--more CO2 in the atmosphere does indeed mean higher temperatures globally (If the power of the sun remains relatively constant).\n\nYou think you are smart and try to explain me thinks I know since I was a child, and you think that climate will continue in the same way consistently because the only variable is CO2 and we will soon live in an oven here, but current measurements show that you are wrong and that climate is much more in-depth and will always vary through time\n--I do not think I am smarter, but I know that I am presenting facts as you present opinion. CO2 is not the only variable and I never claimed it was. Current temperatures are rising exactly as the models predicted they would. The models predict that as the world consumes ever more fossil fuel, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise, and Earth’s average surface temperature will rise with them. Based on a range of plausible emission scenarios, average surface temperatures could rise between 2°C and 6°C by the end of the 21st century.

The only thing man can possibly do to mitigate the effects of increase CO2 is to facilitate a filtration system which is not even being discussed. With an increase in population and the need to increase food production would an increase in CO2 not be beneficial with regard to crop production? Make no mistake all of the fossil fuels being burned today will eventually be burned through natural processes.

What really is at stake and not mentioned are humanitarian global geological and anthropological stewardship.  This concept, of course, would encompass climate change, loss of species, rising CO2's effects, or lack thereof, dwindling fish in the oceans, rising sea levels.  To call it just climate change, misses the mark in its entirety.  The focus is wrong. Planet Earth can still easily turn into hell without burning another single ton of coal or driving a vehicle a single mile.  I think its time to admit that we, as humans, can live with climate change.  At the same time, why don't we try some planetary climate geoengineering? Space positioned Infrared blockers to renew glaciation, a world wide ban on dumping waste of any kind into the oceans, a serious limit on equatorial deforestation- to name a few.  The current warnings against warming being trumpeted might actually be keeping us out of an ice age.  Is it not true that for every 1 deg K increase in global temperature that 380 ppm CO2 is responsible for only 0.004 deg F rise in temperature? Or was it deg C? CO2 does not create heat, the sun does.

Yes we did have to stop man's encroachment on Nature in many areas but the world's population has continued to grow without the natural world being murdered as it were.\n\nThere IS no climate change. In order to \"prove\" it, all of the data has been manufactured. NASA has actually changed the data three times. The IPCC who were supposed to be climate experts it turns out were mostly post-grad students being led by politicians. Anyone looking at Dr. Michael Mann's \"hockey stick\" would be surprised and ask, \"Were is the medieval warm period and the little ice age?\" In order to make our present warming appear to be unusual he simply left that out. He claimed that it was \"a local event\" instead of the world-wide climate that geology shows it to be. Dr. Roy Spencer, head of NASA's weather satellite program has that data from 1979 onward and it shows only the normal weather variations. \n\nWe know that about every thousand years we have warm periods interspersed with cooler periods. In fact this warm period is cooler than the others for which we have proof. Should we therefore ascribe this to man rather than warming? All of the Earth's periods of highest productivity and natures expansion have been during warm periods. It was an ice age that killed off the entire Dinosaur species.

You're being so hypocritical in your reasoning, it's ridiculous.\n\nThe only reason you know about those past times is because climate scientists told you about them. Far from simply being ignored, this data is the foundation of how we assess the current climate. CO2 is one of many variables which impact global temperatures, and this past data is what scientists use to assess CO2's individual contribution.

Other plants produce more but lose their 30% of their nutrient value  Weeds tend to thrive. So do many pests while their predators (bird, bats) don't do as well. Soil that is subject to alternating drought and extreme rains undergoes a change in composition. It becomes less hospitable to planting.

It is currently absorbing 40% of the extra heat resulting from greenhouse effect caused by co2 & other GHG. This is good news & bad news. The good news is that the atmosphere would be heating up faster if the ocean wasn't absorbing this heat. The bad news is that the ocean also absorbs co2. This is causing the ocean to grow more acid creating problems for corals (home to 15% of marine life) and shell fish, as well as a plankton (forget name) that provides food going up the good chain.  The marine habitat is under threat and so is the food source of millions of people.\nOkay, I wasn't totally correct about it being good news that the ocean is absorbing heat. I left out the part about thermal expansion. When you heat up water, the molecules expand, taking up more room. This causes the level of the water to go up. The same thing happens with the ocean. 40% of current sea level rise is due to thermal expansion. The rest is due to ice sheet melt. As the sea level rises it has to go somewhere. It goes on land and up rivers. Land that isn't flooded but is now closer to shore, as well as land near the now brakish river become poisoned by salt and useless to agriculture. Think Florida, land of citrus and produce. More than half of Florida may be lost to agriculture.  Think Lousiana, land of seafood. And California is having longer & more intense fire seasons, water shortages etc. These may or may not be caused by global warming but it does suggest we should not be over-confident that we can rely on it as a food source.  \n\nClimate change is about more than plants.\n\n All denial is ultimately about choosing passivity over action.

Conservatives never offer solutions because to them the environment is totally expendable.  Yes, maybe we should reform the EPA.  But get rid of it? So utterly naive to think that big corporations like GE will watch over the environment for us (you know...the company that said \"We bring good things to life\" as they dumped 3.1 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson River).  Or perhaps, Bill O'Reilly, or Rush Limbaugh will watch over it for us. Actually, speaking of GE, they have dozens of toxic waste sites that are being cleaned up with TAXPAYER (your) dollars. So, then Solendra fails and I hear about what a waste of time and money it is pursuing alternative energy sources, with relentless attacks on Obama. Instead of offering solutions or options that would foster alternative energy means, conservative idiots like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio just want to keep drilling for oil  and mining coal. That's their solution. Sometimes I think that \"Climate Change\" is a distraction from an arguably equally significant problem: one of pollution and fucking up the planet in general. Toxins litter the planet. Nearly every ecological niche is being decimated for the sake of profit (conservative code word: \"jobs\") But who is profiting? Multinational corporations like Unilever are doing away with world-wide rain forests altogether, not for the sake of jobs, but for the sake of profit. Cruz and Rubio have voted against nearly every program proposed to protect the planet (and animals). In contrast, California is at least attempting to build a better state economy while simultaneously becoming more \"Green.\" That is what my conservative friends would call a \"progressive\"\nmentality. To a conservative, \"progressive\" is a four-letter word (as is \"Darwin\").  To the rest of us \"progressive\" is what got us here.  I take the tag \"secular-progressive\" as a compliment. For this reason, and many others, years from now we will look back on conservative agenda as retrogressive (the opposite of progressive) as we often do. If you want to talk about a huge waste of taxpayer dollars, start with the Iraq war we waged over a decade ago. Hundreds of billions of dollars, wounded veterans being cared for for the rest of their lives, a loss of world-wide respect, and a cultural vacuum filled by ISIS who's founders we ironically freed from  imprisonment after the overthrow of Saddham.\nAnd all predicated on the lie of Weapons of Mass Destruction (lol).

You're just ignorant about what \"positive feedback\" is. You seem to think that all positive feedback must result in a runaway effect where the Earth becomes a \"fireball within a few moments.* That's a very silly belief for you to have.\n\nYou can have positive feedback loops in warming that don't end up like a \"fireball\" or Venus. For example, the positive feedback loop in warming can go on for awhile, and then be reversed by a negative feedback loop that cools the planet, often resulting in ice ages. That's what happened on Earth, as discussed in the scientific literature. Of course, by the time the negative feedback kicks in to sufficient levels, the positive feedback would have produced enough warming to have detrimental effects on humans. It's that positive feedback, amongst other factors, that folks like James Hansen are worried about. For further discussion, see the following Youtube video from 1:55 to 3:36:\n\"The Runaway Greenhouse Effect - James Hansen\"\n\nIn that video, Hansen makes the points I just noted. For example, he explains that the runaway greenhouse gas effect on Venus is different than Earth's cycles between ice ages and a warmer surface where all the ice caps are gone. In talking about Venus, Hansen was talking about a scenario in which an irreversible positive feedback occurs. Hansen knows full well that that does not apply to Earth, since Hansen is aware of the cyclical pattern of ice ages and the other patterns I brought up.

However, in the past decade, under the impetus of the feminist critique, some mathematicians have given renewed attention to the theory of ``manifolds with boundary''  Perhaps not coincidentally, it is precisely these manifolds that arise in the new physics of conformal field theory, superstring theory and quantum gravity.\nIn string theory, the quantum-mechanical amplitude for the interaction of n closed or open strings is represented by a functional integral (basically, a sum) over fields living on a two-dimensional manifold with boundary In quantum gravity, we may expect that a similar representation will hold, except that the two-dimensional manifold with boundary will be replaced by a multidimensional one. Unfortunately, multidimensionality goes against the grain of conventional linear mathematical thought, and despite a recent broadening of attitudes (notably associated with the study of multidimensional nonlinear phenomena in chaos theory), the theory of multidimensional manifolds with boundary remains somewhat underdeveloped. Nevertheless, physicists' work on the functional-integral approach to quantum gravity continues, and this work is likely to stimulate the attention of mathematicians.\n\nAs Irigaray anticipated, an important question in all of these theories is: Can the boundary be transgressed (crossed), and if so, what happens then? Technically this is known as the problem of ``boundary conditions''. At a purely mathematical level, the most salient aspect of boundary conditions is the great diversity of possibilities: for example, ``free b.c.'' (no obstacle to crossing), ``reflecting b.c.'' (specular reflection as in a mirror), ``periodic b.c.'' (re-entrance in another part of the manifold), and ``antiperiodic b.c.'' (re-entrance with  tex2html_wrap_inline1413 twist). The question posed by physicists is: Of all these conceivable boundary conditions, which ones actually occur in the representation of quantum gravity? Or perhaps, do all of them occur simultaneously and on an equal footing, as suggested by the complementarity principle?74\n\n\nSo what can you say to refute this?", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Bruce Frykman", "channel": "UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT9nAHoHszJVuJ9cqwbvZ3EBY6SW9eGgk2i8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Government does not work well with nuance. They have their own incentive mechanisms to appeal to protectionist policy. That isn't because it costs the government less. It's because government costs require increases in revenue- which allow for increases in budgetary allotments and legislation to assign power structures (which have their own incentives). As there is no need to balance the budget, which would require large tax increases to substantiate these policies (therefore constraining exaggeration through public scrutiny of the money spent), the only incentive remaining​ is growth. So, an unconstrained government, one which is not accountable for how it spends it's people's money, is incentivized to grow exponentially.\n[Note:\nThe nature of Government is incentivized to grow by it's birth. Obtaining votes is done by offering change, which more often then not involve increases in budget expenditures, and increases in debt (seeing as the tax revenues aren't required to balance the budget).  ]\n\nSo what motivation do scientists have to form conclusions before testing? If they reply to a call from studies into global warming, yet come to conclusions that do not warrant their further funding, there is one obvious motivation- to maintain import. Continued payment and status increases upheld by government use of tax payer monies is a boon for this previously obscure science. If you recognize the microcosms of incentive from every perspective along this trail you will see that this is no conspiracy, but the outcome of incentive forces at work across a large industry. \n\nIt is perhaps complex, but to think that this is not influencing outcomes would be foolish. As this speaker highlights, tabacco companies had incentive to ignore  the harmful effects of smoking. So to is Government incentivized to increase it's reach without constraint. So to, in unison, are climate scientists incentivized to propagate their importance. It is no small.coincidence that as government control increases so to do climate predictions. \n\nAs an example: It may have been addressed earlier, outside of these incentive arguments, there has been no true consensus in this field. In fact, the study by Cook which established this 97% myth has been complealty debunked. That is a confirmed fact which has been peer reviewed!! Yet no where has this been exposed to the mainstream.

I certainly don't worry about man-made radiation when the source of the radiation is external and fixed. Stay far enough away from it and you're fine. The only time that man-made radiation is truly dangerous is when it's particulate and has the capacity to become internal radiation.

By the way, one of the reasons we have the kind of skin we have is because of the sun.

Modern coal fired power plants account for a tiny percentage of air pollution, most comes from road traffic and construction. I urge everyone to inform yourself of the facts, a good place to start is by watching a documentary about the wind farms in Ontario. They pay insane record high power bills because of wind farms,  the government and green energy companies have destroy a lot of productive farm land, people have had to leave their family homes. If you shut down coal plants and replace them with gas/wind plants the power bills go through the roof, you will create a class of 'energy poor' people who will have to choose between heating or eating so that a bunch of eco warrior hypocrites who use plastic, drive around in petrol guzzling cars and run fireplaces in their daily lives can feel better about themselves thinking that their government is doing something about climate change, what a joke, it's a delusion and a total disaster. Meanwhile China and India they aren't stupid and they aren't slowing down, they are building more coal power plants to fuel their manufacturing industry which drives their growing middle class while ours is shrinking. China now has the number one economic place on the ladder and the worlds most billionaires. A more effective approach to sustainability and caring for the environment is to control to modernise and upgrade heavy industry with technology to make it cleaner and more efficient, that's where our green subsidies should be spent. We also need brilliant chemists who can discover alternative ways of manufacturing petrochemicals which we need for industrial farming and nearly all aspects of modern civilization. Bio fuel, waste to energy plants and incinerators have huge efficiencies over wind turbines and solar plants. Bio plants and incinerators get rid of waste, they generate power and they make valuable fertilizers and other chemicals, they also make money rather than take money from the government, more focus should better utilising and improving these recycling options. Solar panels and wind turbines require energy and fossil fuels to produce and are expensive to maintain, they require mined metals, plastics, and other finite materials, there is no free energy, you can't beat the power density and efficiency of coal, oil gas and hydro, do the math. People really need to think this through and understand that Hillary Clinton gets most of her campaign money from Energy companies. These are the same companies that stand to profit greatly if she wins, they will sit back collecting tax payer money through government subsidies and they will also double dip by selling us the most expensive power that we have ever seen. Hillary is depending on turning ignorant people into voters, the brainwashed hordes of people who have been convinced by the climate change propaganda. If it comes down to Trump vs Hillary it's critical that the people understand this and realise what is at stake. Trump is against climate change because he is aware of the energy companies tactics, he has clearly said he cares about having clean air and a clean environment for the next generation, this means he will look for rational ways to achieve our common goal rather than sell us out to the energy company crooks. I'm not saying that there is no place for solar, satellites and probes out in space make good use of PV panels, they have their place. Wind turbines make sense off the coast or in 'wind alleys' in remote off grid areas away from population centres, but they should be private ventures, not government subsidised initiatives.\n-Trump 2016", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "eraser101YT", "channel": "UCL3LMJdO36SojHH13C-RSSg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQeoKl5fxqGUQtdKqt_oeNPlac5Veaqmdh1qY9e2g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugj9wQsAsbSrO3gCoAEC", "text": "Abundant means sufficient to meet needs. In this way, there is ample supply of all atmospheric gas, and thus they are equally abundant.\n\nEquilibrium means the intake and discharge of oxygen and carbon dioxide by organisms; the most abundant gas, nitrogen is neutral and serves as the pavement, the foundation and the footings of Earth's atmosphere. Increases in oxygen result from plant growth, which consume carbon dioxide to do so. Carbon dioxide is liberated into the atmosphere from many sources, principally biological decay and combustion. Carbon dioxide is created from the decay of carbon monoxide, a direct result of combustion. Hydrocarbon combustion in vehicles is converted to dioxide quickly in the emissions phase, eliminating the short, several hour span of monoxide and harmful effects. The great majority of hydrocarbon combustion conducted for heat production on Earth is but a fraction of the carbon dioxide output that occurs. \n\nCarbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has not increased forty percent on Earth, as suggested. Spot measurements on the surface might reveal this figure; there are other factors not considered as they are not measured and unable to be measured, at this point.\n\nHuman technology does not measure the total volume of Earth's atmosphere; it is not static. Also not measured is the difference in concentrations at altitude. There is not a homogeneous mixture of Earth atmosphere gases; carbon dioxide is heavier than the two atom oxygen molecule and shows higher concentrations closer to the surface.\n\nHumans measure concentrations in more densely populated areas, where human use of fuels increases the concentration temporarily. Long term study and analysis of gaseous concentrations far from human populations and activities, such as across vast, un-populated land masses and over oceans and at altitudes above these locations, across Earth's surface, would reveal differences not considered now.\n\nThe percentage increases and declines in oxygen and carbon dioxide are indeed much different, because the base amounts are so different. Gaseous equilibrium of these two substances has long been present on Earth, where the exchange in amounts is relatively even, by molecule. Thus one molecule of carbon dioxide, with two oxygen atoms is consumed by a plant, which liberates two atoms of oxygen, or one molecule, as part of its biological process. The carbon atom remains in the plant, along with hydrogen and is liberated when the plant dies and decays. Individual species vary this greatly, yet across any area of surface vegetation, the weighted average is nearly always one to one. This aspect of plant biology is not measured, as the total population of plants, trees and vegetable life is difficult or impossible to accurately measure. \n\nThere will be no collapse of the human population from climate variation, which is beyond control of human beings. Human activity has not caused erratic weather and cannot, within all activities. We suggest human production of water vapor or steam could have a greater effect yet also immaterial against the total evaporation of hydrogen dioxide, or water, that now occurs. Even if humans were to liberate steam in material amounts, equilibrium of temperature would result and the average temperatures at the surface would fall. Increased precipitation would cause this. \n\nErratic patterns of weather currently observed on Earth are set against a brief sliver of Earth climate history, and have as cause the inner planet temperature variations affecting sea water temperatures far below surfaces, where temperatures have varied.\n\nThe seawater temperature variations at depth cause the shift in deep water current, caused by faster rise and fall of water currents and layers, which behave much as do differing layers of air, yet operate more quickly and with greater effect, given the density of seawater and depth pressures.\n\nHumans do not and cannot measure seawater layers or temperatures many thousands of feet below the surface, where the action occurs, as humans would describe it in English.\n\nMagnetic field variations and their effect on the Earth's core alter the heat reaching the surface, most greatly affecting seawater. The hard surface to land interface is a far less efficient thermocouple, as Earth understanding knows well. Solid to liquid is vastly more efficient and were it possible to measure Earth crust temperatures one to three meters below the ocean floors and also seawater temperatures just above the ocean floor, in approximately twenty five to twenty eight thousand key locations, this would be apparent and revealing. \n\nWe hope you enjoy this very simple insight into Earth understanding and physical behavior heretofore not studied and not understood. Much greater explanations of Earth operation and physical properties will be offered in the coming years, as we detect need and also willingness to embrace ideas not able to be measured.\n\nHuman scientific process correctly requires objective measurement before acceptance of effects occurs, yet this also places a large barrier to consideration of theories - or facts we offer here - because the ability to verify is not yet present. \n\nThis view towards science will alter in the coming decades as technologies and capabilities considered impossible are demonstrated. We refer to an episode of a popular human television program named Star Trek; in this program, one episode mentions transparent aluminum. Indeed there will be demonstrated the ability to create a material with weight, strength and density of this metal and the transparency of glass. \n\nOur thanks and appreciation for your questions, and also our gratitude for the enjoyment we will have upon observation of the reaction to our statements. A great honor to be offering these ideas to humanity.

In all seriousness though, even if  the cause of climate change isn't anthropogenic, you can't argue that the climate isn't changing. And with a changing climate comes drastic consequences. So maybe instead of arguing about whether the evidence supports that climate change is anthropogenic, use the time and energy to figure out solutions to stop it or methods to cope with it.\nI happen to believe the evidence. In my opinion the best solution is to produce artificial trees that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere in conjunction with continuing efforts to reduce CO2 emissions\nhttp://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121004-fake-trees-to-clean-the-skies\nIf the Wright brothers could invent a plane by observing how birds fly, then why can't we invent something that sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere like a tree? Mother nature has already provided many answers to the worlds most important questions.\nThe great thing with this is that it could be economical. One way is that  the CO2 could be reacted with water to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Those products can be easily converted to hydrocarbons to use as fuel. I recommend you read the article for the details. \nAlso, enacting legislation to reduce climate change is good, but it takes too much time. On top of that, we as humans want instant pleasure which means we are not good at taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint because it requires effort and compromise.

Below 200ppm CO2 would cause problems for our sustained wellbeing. The pre-industrial levels of 280ppm could ja argued to be close to a sweet point as it was balanced and could have sustained for a while longer until the earths next wobble of axis. Today though we have gone over 400ppm, and earths temperature has changed by about 1 degree Celsius. That in turn will cause CO2 levels to raise due to all the methane the thawing ground will release into the atmosphere, and by the warming ocean releasing more CO2. So it is likely that the CO2 levels will be doubling to 800ppm at the very least, even if we stopped our CO2 pollution. It could ja argued that it would be way better for fauna, as it thrives from higher levels. It is also possible that without us the earth would have warmed by it itself during the next 200 000 years.

Much of that time, CO2 was over 1000ppm (compared to today's near 400ppm). And the oceans did not boil away or the planet burn up. Even the polar bears survived the far warmer, 3000-year, Holocene Optimum. It was so warm, evaporating more water from the oceans, that the added rain made the Sahara green for more than a thousand years.\n\nDid you know that we're still in an Ice Age? The news doesn't talk about this, but we've been in an Ice Age for 2.6 Million years. The Holocene interglacial warm period of the current Ice Age is 12,000 years old.

In point of fact, the ocean is basic rather than acidic (ie, its ph is always appreciably higher than 7, and there is no possibility of increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 bringing it down to 7; note that ph is a measure of acidity or basicness: values greater than 7 are basic and less than 7 acid.), and the purported changes simply refer to making the ocean a bit less basic.

Science is a enterprise based on evidence, logic, facts and the testing of ideas. At some point in history, the majority believed that the Earth was flat, that the sun revolved around the Earth, or that it was impossible to perform heart surgery. Excuse me sir, but consensus is not scientific evidence. Let me ask you a ask question, if 10 people all agreed that something was true, do you think its possible for all 10 to be wrong? How about 100 people, 1000, 100,000? Because we humans are such social animals, we tend to go along with the crowd, so our very instinct relies on us to trust the group. Because in the wild, it doesn't matter if the group takes the wrong direction, its more important that the group stay together than anything else. Its why a herd of water buffalo will throw themselves off a cliff and thousands of them end up dying. So, yes, it might shock you to know that even if a million people all agree on something, it is possible that every single one of them. All one million of them are simply wrong. \n\nThe great thing about science that it's suppose to be objective, that its conclusions are not based on one's instincts, emotions or intuitions, but based on the facts and evidence on hand. And the truth about climate change, is that yes, climate change happens, but the climate has changed for billions of years! The key question is the recent climate change because of human activity? and the simple answer is: there is No evidence that humans are the main cause of climate change!

These statements are political. They are the opinions of the organization's leadership, not the unanimous or even majority vote of members - members are not asked. Obama has made similar statements and that definitely does not mean the unanimous or even majority agreement of the American people - we are never asked.\n\nIt is egregious that scientific organizations and government agencies (especially those funding research) have stated a position on a topic under research. Try getting research funding or publication if you don't say you agree with the official position. What other scientific topic is so political that agencies issue statements supporting a particular theory? Where are the position statements on dark matter? Or on what killed off the dinosaurs?

{"cid": "Ughl4Qb1mxUMlHgCoAEC", "text": "So this asshat thinks that the science of climate change consists of creating a series of straw-man analogies and using emotional arguments.  Is this science?\n\nHere is the science:\n\n1 - The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is determined by the starvation of plants.  If there were no plants then there would be no O2 and a lot of CO2.  Plants eat O2 and crap out CO2.  They stop growing if the CO2 (food) gets too low.\n2  - Plants used to be worse at this.  There are two mechanisms of photosynthesis.  Back in the (scary voice) \"age before dinosaurs\", plants were shit at sucking all the CO2 out of the atmosphere and so the CO2 concentration was way higher than now.\n3 - The earth has just come out of a well-known cold period.  Before global-warming became a dogma, the 1880s were called the \"little ice age\".  Temperatures were obviously colder than had been before, as recorded by contemporary observers.  Rivers were freezing which had no recent record of such, etc.  Then we invented thermometers and started measuring temperatures.  And it went up.  Big surprise.\n4 - The theory of CO2 induced warming is based on positive feedbacks.  The idea is that CO2 itself does not cause most of the warming, but that it cause a little warming.  The increased warming causes more water vapor, which causes more warming, which causes more water vapor, which causes more warming which...  And the water vapor causes all the warming.  If you think about this, it doesn't matter what kicks this process off.  Consider:  Volcano blows up causing more water vapor...  Generally in control theory, systems which have this kind of runaway behavior have already run away.  If someone tells you that \"you should not breathe on that thing or else it will explode\" then you should ask \"so all the other people who breathed on it before didn't make it explode?\".  The CO2 = warming theory is a theory that CO2 makes temperatures explode.\n5 - The \"hockey stick\" you may have seen is the result of a field scientist not understanding math.  Michael Mann is an expert on tree rings who decided to try to figure out what the past temperatures were from his data.  He (like a good scientist) didn't trust his own data, so he go other people's data (coral reefs, etc).  Then he took temperature records from 1950-1995 (training data) and used them to make a linear regression (science talk for using math to guess what the relative strengths of different inputs are to influencing an output).  He found that his dataset matched exactly the training data, but that it made a flat line = 0 for the time before the training data.  Being ignorant of the math of generic linear algebras, he published this result.  The problem with this analysis is that if you take random data instead of tree rings you get the same result.  This is math, not science.  If the training data had been a U shape then the output would have been a flat line, then a U.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Keeman", "channel": "UCuXRsVD2rJdPs_rstTQZeow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkcy198cVCrJiCwWyVppaXqSsgrvwOjGnizC4Z=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Completely wrong headed theories can render remarkable utility and are therefore scientific.   \n\nQuantum theory is almost certainly incorrect and probably not just at the margins. It works for the things we ask of it but can't help us solve deeper mysteries. \n\nThe models of the crystalline celestial spheres of Ptolemy provided exquisite detail of planetary and stellar motions, with one tiny flaw...what was the troublesome retrograde motion of Mars caused by?  Oh well it was only one little flaw to an otherwise nearly perfect theory of celestial motion.\n\nProposing that mathematics is is the purest form of science is rubbish.    This is like saying grammar is the purest form of literature.  Mathematics like grammar exists outside of the world of reality. \n\nI agree that there is nothing conspiratorial in the ideals of sciences or in faith.

Including the collection of all data, the processing of it and the publishing of results.\n\n4) Explain how denying the availability of abundant affordable energy that has doubled life expectancy and diminished human servitude, disease, and misery in developed nations will be lessened by making our cheap affordable energy more expensive and out of reach of the masses (more jobs per kilowatt, more jobs per bushel of wheat, loaf of bread etc )    \n\n5) Explain how much cooler you expect the planet to be by 2100 by compelling huge segments of our economy to be put under control of central planners and how this will benefit everyone.   Should all peoples and all nations suffer energy poverty equally?   Should senior world leaders move into efficiency apartments, bike to work, forgo  excessive consumerism (fresh fruits and vegetables in winter for instance) and stop their ceaseless junketing to \"save the earth\" \n\n6) Explain exactly what the difference is between a \"policy maker\" and an \"elected representative\" is and in the case of a conflict over policy who should prevail?    \n\nThese will do for starters but this is such a target rich field I cant be expected to list all of the issues in one little post.

But I'm going to cite some evidence for the sake of anyone who's curious.\n\n\n\n\"1) Measure the \"average\" surface temperature of the Earth to 0.1 degree C of accuracy either in the present or within historical reach.   Beyond highly urban areas which produce little islands of heat like a kid peeing in the ocean,\"\n\nYou're offering another standard denialist talking point about the urban heat island effect (UHI). \n\nThe temperature records are not primarily from urban areas; there are, in fact, many temperature stations in rural areas, and temperature proxy records from cold regions (especially ice-covered regions where people can collect ice cores).\n\nWhen you look at rural sites, there's statistically significant warming. When you correct for any UHI, there's still statistically significant surface warming and most of the observed surface warming remains; so the UHI does not work as an explanation of the observed surface warming. And there wasn't really a statistically significant difference in the warming trend between rural American stations that AGW denialists like Antony Watts like, and stations denialists don't like.\n\nHere are some scientific research papers to get you started, providing evidence for the points I made above about the UHI and temperature rise:\n\n\"Influence of Urban Heating on the Global Temperature Land Average using Rural Sites Identified from MODIS classifications\"\n\"Earth Atmospheric Land Surface Temperature and Station Quality in the Contiguous United States\"\n\"Urban heat island effects on estimates of observed climate change\"\n\"A Demonstration That Large-Scale Warming Is Not Urban\"\n\"Assessment of Urban Versus Rural In Situ Surface Temperatures in the Contiguous United States: No Difference Found\"\n\"Urban and rural temperature trends in proximity to large US cities: 1951–2000\"\n\"Urbanization effects in large-scale temperature records, with an emphasis on China\"\n\"Urbanization-related warming in local temperature records: a review\"\n\"Evaluating the impact of U.S. Historical Climatology Network homogenization using the U.S. Climate Reference Network\"\n\"On the reliability of the U.S. surface temperature record\"\n\"Urbanization Effects on Observed Surface Air Temperature Trends in North China\"\n\n\n\n\"2) Define what such an average means, what it consists of and what it excludes or why any of it is of importance.  The globe does not have an \"average\" climate.  It has millions of separate climates.\"\n\nWhich is as ridiculous as saying that:\n\"The room's air does not have an \"average\" temperature.  It has millions of separate temperatures.\"\n\nGlobal warming is measured in terms of temperature anomalies relative to a baseline. Average temperature is normally defined in terms of the average of the minimum and maximum temperature at the site.\n\n\n\n\"Furthermore this defective theory predicts \"atmospheric warming\"\"\n\nThere's been warming of the troposphere (lower atmospheric layer) and cooling of the stratosphere (a higher atmospheric layer), which is what you'd expect greenhouse-gas-induced global warming.\n\nHere are some sources on this warming pattern:\n\n\"A second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting “hotter.”\"\nhttp://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?\n\n\"Sensitivity of Satellite-Derived Tropospheric Temperature Trends to the Diurnal Cycle Adjustment\"\n\"Assessing atmospheric temperature data sets for climate studies\"\n\"Comparing tropospheric warming in climate models and satellite data\"\n\"Attributing the forced components of observed stratospheric temperature variability to external drivers\"\n\"Comment on “Climate Science and the Uncertainty Monster” by J. A. Curry and P. J. Webster\"\n\"Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature\"\n\n\n\n\"3) Demonstrate the predictive accuracy of the just ONE CAGW theory (not the 30 to  50 of them)\"\n\nThis is further confirmation that you're a denialist/contrarian, since \"CAGW\" is a straw man used by contrarians/denialists:\n\n\"Polluted Discourse: Communication and Myths in a Climate of Denial\n[...]\nAdditionally, we find that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a straw man used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50).\"\n\n\n\n\"4) Explain how denying the availability of abundant affordable energy [...]\"    \n*\"5) Explain how much cooler you expect the planet to be by 2100 by compelling huge segments of our economy [...]\" \n\"6) Explain exactly what the difference is between a \"policy maker\" [...]\n\nPolitical/economic ramblings for you, that are irrelevant to the scientific evidence supporting the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. What you're doing is inventing political/economic straw men, and then act as if one needs to defend these straw men in order to support the scientific consenusus on anthropogenic climate change. That's silly of you. It's as ridiculous as saying that:\n\n\"before I accept that smoking causes cancer, you need to discuss:\n1) why it's OK to deny people access to cigarettes,\n2) the precise number of people you expect to save by legally compelling people not to smoke\n3) what a \"policy maker\" is.\"\n\nSeriously, stop conflating policy with science.\n\n\n\n\"These will do for starters but this is such a target rich field I cant be expected to list all of the issues in one little post.  It requires volumes\"\n\nSo like many other denialists, you'll move the goalposts:\n\n\"Of all the characteristics of deniers, repeatedly nudging back the goalpost—or the threshold of evidence required for acceptance of a theory—is often the most telling. The strategy behind goalpost-moving is simple: always demand more evidence than can currently be provided. If the evidence is then provided at a later date, simply change the demand to require even more evidence, or refuse to accept the kind of evidence that is being offered.\"\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

These data sets are compiled independently of each other and using different satellite instruments. What is more significant is that the radiosonde data agrees, that is measurements from thermometers mounted on weather balloons. All three measure the temperature of the lower troposphere which extends from about 3 metres above the ground to about 25,000 feet. This is the part of the atmosphere where weather happens. Only the ground based weather stations show any warming, but how reliable are they? Not very. For a start, the raw data, i.e. the actual thermometer readings, show cooling since 2000, and it is only after they have been adjusted and homogenised by NASA and NOAA that any sign of warming appears. I'm sure these two agencies believe they are doing a good job, but at the same time  we must realise that if these guys did not find warming they would soon be hit by government cut backs in funding leading to job losses. Let us say that there is unfair pressure on them from government to make findings that the government desires.

This implies that the system is not stable, and even without humans it should have tipped over long ago.  We have observational evidence that this has not happened, at least in the warming direction.\n\nWhich leads me to the next point.  The ice ages and positive feedback.  It is pretty well certain that the ice age patterns are a hysteretic response to Milankovitch cycles through northern hemisphere albedo.  The solar flux goes up and and down and the northern hemisphere glaciers go into a positive feedback snap response due to the albedo.  This is a well documented, easily explainable positive feedback response which has been observed many times in the geological record.  A control theorist sees this as a nonlinear system with two zones of attraction.  If your theory if CO2 positive feedback were true, you would expect the end of the ice age to fly right by the glaciers melting and go right into the greenhouse you fear.  Consistently the earth has gone into net stable negative feedback once the glaciers melt off.  If your positive feedback from CO2 was as bad as the scare mongers say if \"might be\" then you would have seen it occur already.  Because that is what positive feedback systems do, they snap across the positive feedback until they hit another negative feedback region.  When CO2 was higher than now it didn't happen.  So unless nature cares about whether the CO2 was made by man or not, then we have evidence that this is not a problem in the geological record.\n\nRegarding the hockey stick:  I do know what the fuck I am talking about.  I do this kind of signal analysis as part of my job and have extensive training in it.  It is just basic stuff about basis functions and random data.  You give me enough randomly generated waveforms and I can make any shape out of it I like over a finite region of the X-axis.  And the expectation of the area which I didn't try to shape is zero, with some residual random fluctuations.  This is exactly what you see in the various Mann-style temperature reconstructions.  And people have taken Matlab generated random data and achieved the same result.  So the tree rings are irrelevant to the hockey stick, except that they have enough noise in their data to fit whatever you want.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Keeman", "channel": "UCuXRsVD2rJdPs_rstTQZeow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkcy198cVCrJiCwWyVppaXqSsgrvwOjGnizC4Z=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Models. They are predictions based on hypothesis. All science needs a standard of falsifiability. A computer models standard of falsifiability is empirical data. The empirical data shows the models are false.\n\nNow the question is, well, whats wrong with them?\n\nIts pretty obvious the mistake is in the idea of a multiplier effect due to cloud feedback. Im sure all you well read climate buffs so keen on facts are aware CO2 contributes to 3.6% of the greenhouse effect where as water vapor accounts for 95%. The problem with the UNs models is that they claim a massive increase water vapor due to increases in CO2 although empirical data shows an inverse relationship to both. This is a major flaw that is not address in this debate you people claim is over.\n\nAll UN computer models are based almost entirely on an idea of cloud feedback and it directly contradicts empirical data. When the models are changed to have a dampening effect, or an inverse relationship, they are far more accurate.\n\nJohn cooks 97.1% consensus (which is why you science buffs are so quick to jump on the global warming wagon without doing your homework) is not true.

The fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas has been known for more than 100 years now. It traps heat, no matter how much you cry and plead, it will always do that.\n\nBy the way, you sound like an ignoramus about those models. It is clear about what you say about them. For one predictions are not the same as projections. Models ARE getting tested against observations that are made. What is more: The models that are used are unable to predict the recent warming without taking rising CO2 levels into account. It is a clear indication that CO2 is causing the rise in temperature.\n\nYou also seem to be in the dark about what positive feedback is. Yes, we know water vapor is also a greenhouse gas and that it is abundant in the atmosphere, that's not the point. Temperature goes up -> more water vapor  -> temperature goes up, etc... CO2 causes the temperature to go up, this isn't disputed! When temperature goes up, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere goes up too, which causes more warming. It is as simple as that. Nobody hides the fact that water vapor isn't a greenhouse gas! This is known. It is part of the entire process. The culprit, however, causing the initial warming is CO2\n\nJohn cooks 97.1% consensus (which is why you science buffs are so quick to jump on the global warming wagon without doing your homework) is not true. Specifically how? You can look that up for yourself. You won't believe me. The actual number of scientists in that study who believe in AGW that should be addressed with public policy change is 0.3%. Stop reading about what Monckton and his cronies are saying, they are  lying. It is ridiculous, they change the entire premise of the study that Cook did, just to get to that number. And their statistics are crooked as hell. Cook's study shows exactly that 97%of people involved in climate science, with an opinion on global warming, endorse AGW. It even asked the scientists themselves: the same number 97% came up. That's all it does.

Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapor content makes the atmosphere warm further; this warming causes the atmosphere to hold still more water vapor (a positive feedback), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop. The result is a much larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO2 alone. Although this feedback process causes an increase in the absolute moisture content of the air, the relative humidity stays nearly constant or even decreases slightly because the air is warmer. Climate models incorporate this feedback. Water vapor feedback is strongly positive, with most evidence supporting a magnitude of 1.5 to 2.0 W/m2/K, sufficient to roughly double the warming that would otherwise occur.\"\n\nAn article from Science magazine, dealing with the same issues: http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/dessler09.pdf", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Cinqmil", "channel": "UCSSTRGCDEVtRBqN0kDnZbhQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRJ172w1YgD12nOCjobXrdC_pz940u32RoN3g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The new satellite data from the NASA water vapor project shows declining upper atmosphere water vapor during the period 1988 to 2001. It is the best available data for water vapor because it has global coverage. Calculations by a line-by-line radiative code show that upper atmosphere water vapor changes at 500 mb to 300 mb have 29 times greater effect on OLR and temperatures than the same change near the surface. The cooling effect of the water vapor changes on OLR is 16 times greater than the warming effect of CO2 during the 1990 to 2001 period. Radiosonde data shows that upper atmosphere water vapor declines with warming. The IPCC dismisses the radiosonde data as the decline is inconsistent with theory. During the 1990 to 2001 period, upper atmosphere water vapor from satellite data declines more than that from radiosonde data, so there is no reason to dismiss the radiosonde data. Changes in water vapor are linked to temperature trends in the upper atmosphere. Both satellite data and radiosonde data confirm the absence of any tropical upper atmosphere temperature amplification, contrary to IPCC theory. Four independent data sets demonstrate that the IPCC theory is wrong. CO2 does not cause significant global warming.Note 1.

Do I really have to explain everything?\nI was talking about the satellite data (RSS/UAH) which is available from 1978. I'm not cherrypicking anything as I asked the question why not use all the data that is available to you, starting from 1978? The 'no warming from 1998' meme is based on cherrypicked data from those satellites. Go and find it yourself. If you put in the earlier data, it clearly shows a rise in global surface temperatures.\n\n2. The reason 1998 is used as a start date is because there was a freakishly large El Niño event, causing the heat from the ocean to escape to the surface. This was one of the reasons that year was so hot. They needed a high value to started the plot with, so that the trend line would go down. This would make it seem as if no temperature rise took place. While if you use all data, you'll see clearly that the temperature trend is rising.\n\n3. The cooling is something else entirely. Now I have to also explain forcing to you?? Go google 'forcing climate change'. I'll explain it in short. Greenhouse effect makes the temperature go up, aerosols make it go down. When the effect of aerosol forcing is greater than effect of greenhouse gases, it cools. When you remove Aerosols, effect of greenhouse effect takes over again: it warms. (Yes,... there is also forcing from albedo, the sun, clouds, polar ice, etc... All this has to be summed up to see what the temperature will do.) From 1945 till ca1970, a lot of polution from aerosols coming from  industries made the temperature go down, keep in mind however that the greenhouse effect was still there. After aerosols were banned, the greenhouse effect became the bigger forcing: meaning temp goes up. Just google it and read the goddamn papers yourself.\n\n5.

It is a FACT.\n\nCO2 is a greenhouse gas. This is observed and tested. It is a FACT.\n\nMore energy remains in our atmosphere, than is reflected back to space. FACT\n\nWhen you look the infrared wave spectrum of waves leaving our atmosphere, you'll notice a gap at wavefrequencies CO2 has been known to absorb. This is a significant part. The infrared waves spectrum was predicted by models and has been measured and observed. FACT\n\nKeeling curves document the rise of CO2 for more than 50 years. FACT\nThe level of CO2 is rising in our atmosphere. FACT\nCO2 level is now at more  than 400ppm and still rising. FACT\nThe CO2 that causes the warming comes from human activities. FACT\n\nWhen you only use natural forcings in climate models, you cannot explain the recent warming. For that\nthe forcing of CO2 is needed. FACT\n\nAntropogenic climate change is a scientific theory. It is a fact.\n\n\n\n\nOh yes, I almost forgot.\n\nIf you thought that it isn't going to effect our way of life.\n\n- Certain islands will disappear because of sea level rise (a direct consequence of AGW).

FACT\n- Coastal regions will disappear, populations will need to move, sea water will populate inland fresh water sources, etc... all because of sea level rise. IF these are not disasters, I don't know what is. FACTS\n- Some weather phenomena become either more frequent or more severe or both. This will become more obvious in the near future. Data on this point is still small, but is accumulating.\n\nOther likely disasters are droughts, water shortage, beneficial animals and plants dying, collapse of ecosystems,etc...\n\nIf you don't think that this is not severe, then what is?\n\n\nI find it extremely dishonest of you that you first deny that climate change is happening and that you then use a paper that is about a natural forcing. You jump all over the place.\nWhat are you denying exactly?\n\nThe fact that AGW has a manmade cause, means we can still do something about it. If it was only because of natural forcings, it would be a lot harder to manipulate, we would've been sitting ducks. BUT ACTION is needed fast. And people obfuscating the truth are slowing down the view of the general public.\n\nA lot of people don't see the severity of what is happening, and this is because some rogue scientists, lobbyists, all paid by BIG OIL companies are slowing down the necessary steps in overcoming this beast that is AGW.

There's no place for opinion after the hypothesis has been falsified. After that, anyone expressing opinion in favor of the hypothesis aren't thinking clearly.\n\nTo my mind, we conducted such an experiment. The hypothesis that CO2 drives surface temperature was tested as CO2 levels continued to rise this century. So far it's not looking good for the hypothesis.

The present climate hypothesis makes zero effort to explain, let alone model, the previous warm and cool periods. Instead they want to \"get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.\" Being able to explain those major past climate changes would be great, but there's no guarantee we will find proxies for whatever forces are involved.\n\nFuture modeling efforts will have to deal with the fact that the temperature data sets have been corrupted to the point where any efforts to hindcast will be trying to model thousands of politically motivated \"adjustments.\" In some cases we no longer know what the real temperatures were, the original records having been destroyed.\n\nOne of the largest puzzles for me is the rock steady sea level rise since 1900. Although it is doubtless the result of ocean warming, it does not correlate at all with surface warming/cooling cycles. I suspect the deep oceans are warming steadily through some mechanism we don't understand.

In the 70's a very small number of scientists theorized that the Soot and SO2 emissions from factories could cause global cooling. This never got past the point of theory, was never tested, and there never was anything remotely like scientific consensus. Since we passed laws to stop the soot and SO2 we will never know what, if any, effect they would have had on global climate. \n\n\nThere is absolutely NO scientific evidence that CO2 levels increased AFTER \"Climate Change\" As early as the 1800s scientists had predicted that increasing levels of CO2 in our atmosphere would cause increased average temperatures. And the fact that you are looking at this as a \"right\" vs \"left\" issue is interesting. You should be looking for evidence first and then form an opinion. However, someone who looks at everything from a political viewpoint tends to do the opposite. They form an opinion first, then look for \"evidence\" to support that opinion. The fact that you state that you are neither \"left\" nor \"right\" doesn't take away the fact that that you brought politics into your \"argument\" and even mentioned Al Gore. A person who wants to be informed on a subject would look to people who are experts on that subject.\n\n\n\nThe experts in this case are Climate Scientists - the people whose job it is to study cliimate and weather. They are Meteorologists,  Astrophysicists. Atmospheric Physicists, Hydroclimatologists, and other scientists. They do not work for political \"think tanks\" and big oil. Scientists are not \"right\" or \"left\". Although each of them may subscribe to some political viewpoint, this is not how science works and political viewpoints should not ever drive a scientists studies. Scientists look for evidence first, then form opinions. There have been many honest skeptics within the scientific community, each of them raising honest questions regarding possible other causes of current Climate Change. The end result is that each and every other possible source has been proven NOT to the be the cause of Climate Change that we are dealing with. There is overwhelming  scientific consensus regarding Climate Change because there is overwhelming evidence of it. The overwhelming evidence shows that human activity, primarily burning of fossil fuels is causing current Global Warming because of the unprecendented amounts of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere..\n\n\nAnd, by the way, our \"Climate\" doesn't change four times a year.

As this happens, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases and this allows more ice to melt, reducing the reflectivity of the earths surface. Multiple sources from the IPCC and several other sources agree that this positive feedback loop will likely result in the 3'C rise in temperature. That temperature rise means even more water vapor can be held by the atmosphere producing more floods and severe storms.\n\nWe know it's man made CO2 because the isotope carbon 13 is less common in fossel fuels than it is in nature, and the amount of carbon 13 is declining even with the rise in CO2. While you might think, the planet emits way more CO2 than humans, \"Which is correct.\" the system was in balance with the land and oceans absorbing the amount it emits. Roughly 780 gigatons. We as people, emit about 30, but this extra CO2 is not being completely absorbed and hence where the problem is coming from. This is why CO2 is rising beyond its natural balance of about 180-280 parts per million, and is now pushing beyond 400.\n\nAs the ice caps melt and sea levels rise countries like the Philippines and Indonesia will actually have to be completely evacuated as they will no longer be able to sustain human life with no fresh water. Many areas in china are also on low lying land and this will cause problems for them as well, both in fresh water and flood issues. Storms will get stronger and stronger, like the jump from Hurricane Wilma to Typhoon Haiyan and cause even heavier damage along coastal cities in the US and Canada. So overall, while it will no doubt hurt the economy for now, we can afford it. We can't afford the loss of dozens of major cities and displaced people that are sure to follow as the climate finalizes it's changes. By the time it is done, we will be at a population of about 12 billion people.

He is on the advisory board of a foundation in the UK that is concerned with undoing any policy changes that might mitigate the effects of Global Warming.\n\n\n I am also familiar with the fact that most Climate Scientists agree that the questions that he has raised has offered decent food for thought, but, in the end, each of his arguments has been proven incorrect by the evidence.\n\n\nThere have been a great many scientists that have looked at his work, since this is what science is all about - trying to get to the truth of the matter. In one of his talks, sponsored by the Campaign to Repeal the Climate Change Act, scientists point out the many problems with his \"findings\" and assertions. First, he rests most of his criticism of other climate scientists on the fact that there are some unknowns and uncertainties regarding some aspects of cloud feedback processes . He therefore makes assertions that because there are some uncertainties that scientists know nothing. This is practically his whole basis for discounting what virtually every other scientist in the world agrees on. They go on to point out so many inconsistencies and outright fallacies in his presentation that I am not going to bother regurgitating them here.\n\n\nI don't agree with the majority BECAUSE they are the majority. As a scientist myself, I agree with the majority because their opinion is based on evidence. Over the many decades that Climate Scientists have been studying this issue, subjecting their study to true skepticism, they have yet to come up with anything that fits the data other than CO2 and other greenhouse gases that we are pumping into the atmosphere is causing the current Climate Change reality. \n\n\nI will continue looking at this issue because it is the most important issue facing our society. The good news is that since this is a problem we are causing ourselves, if we have the will and the good sense, we can solve it. We did a pretty good job on Acid Rain and looks like possibly on the Ozone problem by facing the facts and doing something about it. Good for us. I hope we also do something in this case before too much of the damage is irreversible.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Patricia Norris", "channel": "UC4p14EtledxIWJ98zoESsDQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSpF3u8Lc6Yz7s7YXDLtTBdBQ1qcwxM5LzkG_Jvww=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugixf5-moSABm3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-2Oho8TR_SR_k2az", "text": "+Belloran24\n\nHere is an excellent response to Ted's Bullshit:\n\n\" Paris climate agreement was never about climate science. Anchored in the premise that climate science is “settled,” the accord seeks to dramatically change humanity’s energy supply. Here, the matter really is settled: It’s not going to happen.\n\nParis advocates assert that, despite President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the agreement, we face an inevitable transition to a multitude of new low-carbon energy technologies that will consign hydrocarbons—oil, natural gas, and coal—to history’s dust heap. All we need to birth the new energy future are the right “incentives,” which Paris provides: The only way to meet aspirational carbon emissions reductions is to replace hydrocarbons.\n\n\nThis so-called multitude of options actually distills to just three things: biofuels, windmills, and solar panels. Some environmentalists include nuclear fission as well. There’s no new physics here: The first fission reaction was in 1939, the first photovoltaic cell was created in 1954, windmills date to the Middle Ages, and making alcohol (the dominant biofuel) predates recorded history.\n\n\nBut, say Paris supporters, all we need are moonshot government programs to see energy tech emulate the “Moore’s Law” progress that happened in computing (the doubling in computer power every two years). Yet to their inconvenience, the physics of energy won’t cooperate.\n\nFueling humanity is not like putting a few people on the moon. It’s like putting everybody on Earth on the moon—permanently. No amount of money obviates the costs of fighting gravity. But pundits in awe of Silicon Valley’s prowess analogize today’s green energy companies to the disruption of landline phone businesses after the advent of cell phones or the disruption of taxis by Uber.\n\nUnfortunately, the physics of energy production scales in exactly the opposite direction of the physics of information production. If aircraft, for example, followed Moore’s Law, a loaded Boeing 777 could reach Japan from New York by burning a housefly’s weight in fuel. Engineers and mathematicians can trick bytes to go faster and slip into ever smaller spaces, but only in science fiction are similar tricks possible with physical objects or humans.\n\nBetter technology has brought solar and wind costs down dramatically in the past decade. And, fueled by over $100 billion in subsidies, while wind and solar have increased 10-fold over a decade, they still supply, respectively, just 0.3% and 2% of America’s energy.\n\n\nRemember biofuels? Ten years ago Silicon Valley legend Vinod Khosla famously predicted that with biofuels there is “no doubt that 100% of our gasoline use can be displaced in the next 25 years.” Now, despite 40% of America’s corn crop used distilled into alcohol, that supplies barely 5% of U.S. transportation. No one expects America or the world to get anywhere close to Khosla’s forecast.\n\nBut there is a stubborn idea that more money—subsidies, tax incentives, grants, or enforced standards—will make solar and wind 10 times cheaper yet again. While all technologies get better over time, they also approach physics’ limits eventually. Aircraft turbine manufacturers brag about single-digit percentage gains in fuel efficiency precisely because those machines are near thermodynamic limits in converting heat to thrust.\n\nSolar cells and wind turbines are now in the same boat. There are no game-changing advances left in the core technologies; both are now on the curve of diminishing returns. (Biofuels crossed that Rubicon centuries ago.) Nor are there big gains in economies of scale for the underlying components—concrete, steel, fiberglass, silicon, wires, and glass are all already in mass production.\n\nIf we want a different energy revolution, we’ll need new discoveries in the physical sciences. That can only emerge from basic research, not from more subsidies for yesterday’s technologies.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the world’s nearly 8 billion people and $80 trillion economy depend on hydrocarbons to supply over 80% of global energy; oil fuels 98% of transportation. Meaningful changes to this status quo won’t come from the Paris agreement with or without the U.S., unless there’s a revolution in physics. And the latter will require very different priorities. Perhaps it’s time to chase real science.\"", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "Bruce Frykman", "channel": "UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT9nAHoHszJVuJ9cqwbvZ3EBY6SW9eGgk2i8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Or are we referring more to the burning of fossil fuels, which is comprised more of hydrogen water vapours, which are in fact a greenhouse gas than CO2; or Methane-gas another well-known greenhouse gas, which again is not CO2.  If people who profess to care so much about saving really cared then why are we not looking at ways to reduce our carbon emissions by: 1) Reducing immigration - by reducing immigration numbers into the country we also reduce the need for the amount of development, which equals fewer trees being bulldozed, which take in CO2, fewer cars on the road and lower rates of crime with the added benefits of more employment. 2) More coal-fired power stations, which as opposed to renewable energies being on offer which have a large carbon footprint require large amounts of energy to power them and are unsustainable, only have a comparably small footprint.

Silly as even God bound to the laws he instruct's unto His children, the big one is \"agency\" God has stated (Christ) he gives man this power of Agency thus even He will not violate nor man also. The word and what it inplys (force) men with guns, no my boy, Jesus did use the word socialism and dispised it!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lewelyn Fidler", "channel": "UCnRZh6Y7ACH9NIv91x2P7pw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR5fpYNdDVbQaTQNbMC6LhItit2vRop6UWVCnrp=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
