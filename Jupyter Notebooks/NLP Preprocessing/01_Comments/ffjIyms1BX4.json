{"cid": "Ugza0uLAFdxnQY9t_QZ4AaABAg", "text": "Thermometre readings all over the globe have shown general warming for decades.  This is a matter of record.  This shows up whether you include urban instruments or not.  There are two and only two ways to heat the planet: either we recieve more energy or we hang on to more.  The sun is our external source of energy.  We've had satellites directly measuring its' output for decades.  It's actually putting out a miniscule amount less energy. so the sun isn't the cause of increased warming.  The warming is happening over too much of the globe to be a simple change in large weather patterns like the Medieval warm period.  If this was a redistribution of heat from other parts of the globe we'd see them get colder.  The upper layers of the ocean are getting warmer but the layers underneath aren't getting colder so that's not the source.  Bore hole measurements around the globe reveal the same level of subsurface heat so that's not it.  The upper layer of the atmosphere is getting colder but it's normally colder than the layers below and heat doesn't travel en masse from cold areas to warm.  Also since the surface is warmer there should be more heat convecting and radiating up while the sun is still providing the same heat from the top so that's not the source either.  The heat absorbing properties of gasses like CO2 have been well understood for well over 150 years now and the amount of them in the air is the only thing that's changed while we've been observing warming.  If anyone has a better culprit in mind then I'm keen to hear it.  In the meantime that heat will do what heat normally does: cause stuff to expand, melt ice and evaporate increasing amounts of moisture into the air only to fall out in greater amounts elsewhere.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Glenn Martin", "channel": "UCt1pdnL9QM0TGf7bkvMTIwQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRLxGXJJE75jD4p_dgO1kvoIocF-8Bji_aP5g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

For example another fact is that the temperature of the planet has increased about 0.95 degrees since 1880, but half of this increase occurred before WWII, a period when industry was emitting a lot less CO2 than post WWII. Another problem are the models which show doom and gloom. The models of the 80's had the planet screwed by the 90's. In the 90's it was by the Millennia, etc. The fact is the only model that has been approximately correct is the Russian model, which shows the temperature going up almost another degree by 2100. The reason why this is important is because we have limited resources. If we spend out resources eliminating man produced carbon, and carbon isn't the cause than we are screwed. If climate change isn't caused by carbon, wouldn't it be better to spend our limited resourced on how to deal with rising ocean levels and other related consequences?

CO2 is the ls the source of all life on the planet and oil is the life blood. The first plants had 40,000 ppm (4%) CO2 before the first animals walked the earth and tar pits and open pools of oil were every where. The first bacteria ate oil and was responsible for all the CO2 in the air. At 300 ppm the earth is experienced a re-greening. The temperature is expected to continue to rise as we continue to exit an ice age. The survival of the earth's ecosystem now depends on man to bring oil to the surface to keep the CO2 level above 400 ppm which will increase crop yields and their drought resistance. As usual the socialist with fake scientist and children leading the  cause their only goal is power and money.  The Gulf oil spill was 1% of all the oil that leaked in the environment that year. Another 3% was man in other parts of the world and the other 96% was natural releases, most of which occur in the sea beds. Because man is now required to keep the CO2 level high enough to maintain life on the planet, man is now the most important part of the earth's ecosystem. If man dies, the earth dies.

However, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal infrared energy.\" \"When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Like coals from a fire that are warm but not glowing, greenhouse gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in ALL DIRECTIONS\". \"Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate heat in ALL DIRECTIONS, some of it spreads downward and ultimately comes back into contact with the Earth’s surface, where it is absorbed. The temperature of the surface becomes warmer than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating of the Earth’s surface by the atmosphere is the natural greenhouse effect.\" Up high or down low, I don't see any difference if NASA is correct. At the height of the Atmosphere, the Earth constitutes 1/3rd of the space. So the IR absorbed by the ghg, both for incoming sun heat and emitted Earth heat, will be absorbed then emitted in \"all directions\". 1/3rd will hit the Earth below and the other 2/3rds will go into space. Of the Earth emitted heat, 1/3rd of that will be absorbed by the ghgs going out, and sent back to the earth adding additional warming to the earth, this warming is the greenhouse effect according to NASA. So, water vapor and the ghgs, cool the earth by blocking out 66.4% of Sun heat, while keeping in only 11% (1/3rd of 1/3rd). The atmosphere keeps out six times more heat than it keeps in. If we add more molecules of CO2 they will absorb more entering sun heat and cool the earth more than they do now. With the earth getting less heat, there will be less heat to keep in, so the GHE should fall. I don't see how, if NASA is correct, we can be warming the planet by adding more CO2 to the atmosphere.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Bill Andrews", "channel": "UCcrROA3wjSQIyk1oLZC1FRQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSyCnXQMgipRiCFYz7PdTgb_CMKwi5e6jJtbQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyEq-efzexhNAUefil4AaABAg", "text": "I have the utmost respect for science. I have never doubted the scientific consensus concerning the acidification of the oceans, rising temperatures, increasing severity of wild fires and hurricanes. I have never doubted that increasing levels of carbon dioxide is the cause and that human activity is the source of that increase. However, you must also weigh the consequences of reducing carbon emissions. That is what thoughtful people do.\n\nThe other day I heard someone claim that we must eliminate carbon emissions now. I thought to myself, \"How could anyone be so stupid that they could actually say such a thing?\" Think about it. What would I have to do to eliminate my carbon emissions. Well, first I would have to stop breathing. Every time I breathe out I am spewing carbon dioxide into the air. Let's leave this one though. Assume it's ok for me to breathe. Let's concentrate on activities that involve fossil fuels. So,  I would not be able to drive my Toyota Prius because it uses gas. Perhaps I could drive an electric car? Well no. I live in an area where my electricity is generated by burning coal. So, while driving electric would be better than driving my Prius, it would not be allowed. Since my electricity come from coal, I would have to unplug my refrigerator and freezer. My potable water is pumped using fossil fuel energy so say goodbye to my water supply. I guess I would have hunt small game and cook it over a wood fire. I would be dead in a few days or few weeks at most. I do not have the skills to live without energy from fossil fuels.\n\nThe immediate consequences of not using fossil fuels are far far worse than the consequences of continuing to use them. This is also a fact every bit as much as the fact of global warming. Not recognizing this fact is just plain stupid. \n\nThe problem with climate change is that it is a huge problem with no simple solutions. Creating a world that does not depend on fossil fuels will require the energy of a lot of fossil fuel. Global warming is something that has already happened. As I write this California is having the worst wild fire season in history. But life goes on. Rising sea levels will not extinguish human life. People will move long before they are knee deep in water. \n\nWhat we need is rationality.  We need engineering. We need to know costs of doing nothing and the costs doing various somethings and then somehow make collective decisions about what should be done.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Matthew Eisentraut", "channel": "UCMJdFmTcNMD8xfAMDyD-anA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgXwib3b6z_gCiXijMANMZ143zeHRguPIa_g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgzhuzetHlYDxsnGmTp4AaABAg", "text": "It's not that people don't believe, well some of them. The problem is that science also tells us all the time that there have been previous climate warning stages and cycles and that we don't have all the information. So what part of science should we believe? Solar panels won't save us, they are equally toxic and Tesla cars use toxic batteries. We have to completely change our way of life to save ourselves. The planet will do just fine we act or we don't. Obviously, if we don't act we will perish, but the planet doesn't care a bit. Besides people are struggling to get a better life while all the rich people are just blaming the poor people to stop improving their lives and stop buying stuff. It's also a social problem. How will you avoid a poor family to buy a car when they have worked years for that, while you are on your mansion in California or wherever making youtube videos. We are not all in the same lifestyle. The problem is NOT that people don't believe, people like that will always exist, the problem is changing our way of life so that even if people don't believe things will get better. People also want to live in California and be YouTubers and have nice vacations just as rich scientists do. Maybe the smart scientist that earns thousands of dollars a year and works in the most consumerist society in the world should set the example first and stop the blaming game. Its easy to say people don't believe while you buy your nice Tesla and tweet from your iPhone pro or whatever and you can pay your expensive health insurance and your kids are not having nutrition problems. Try living in a third world country earning 4 dollars a day and look at how much you will care for climate change. Your nice stable society in the first world countries comes from the hard labor and hard work of all the rest of the world. The PROBLEM is NOT climate change, the problem is how society is built to serve the rich.\nBy the way, when there was most biodiversity on the planet there was no ice on the planet and the climate was way hotter.

Algae, already inhaling half of all the co2 that’s being inhaled and having exponential growth and the entire ocean to grow, may out grow co2 emissions ( I cant find a lot of studies on algae that can prove/disprove this but it would be fairly easy to test this, I think)\n2. The sun, emitting different frequencies of light, emits different “amounts” of different frequencies when their are more or less sunspots on the surface. Although the total solar irradiance seems to be hightened by the decrease of sunspots as shown by NASA, their is still the possibility that the lowering number of sunspots has caused frequency shifting in the light coming from the sun, and therefore more light could be absorbed at the surface of the earth where it is “trapped” better than inside higher layers of the atmosphere. Frequency shifting could potentially warm the earth in many other ways. \n3. The earths magnetic dipole are moving away from true north and south, which may cause more charged particles to enter the atmosphere and heat the earth. This may not seem obvious because true north seems perpindicular to the direction the suns light is coming from, however it is more obvious when you notice that true north is actually slanted and is not completely perpindicular. This is relevant  because magnet poles and other areas of a magnetic field are stronger  than others, and so stronger areas of earths magnetic field will be better at stopping charged particles than others.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe Mama", "channel": "UCUIK8U4UHs6tb-LG7f9SqIg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQpxWKNkKby_RXnZP9jn5ObS9Tw1Q5z5czvBzO-=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And what happened to the  global cooling campaign in the 1970s? Then the Global warming campaign that is now called \"climate change\". Has the science changed or did too many people get wise about the BS theories being mixed in with the the truth so the name had to change? I agree with the campaign and its aim to make more people take care of the environment but attacking people who agree with the facts but don't theorize and fear them is where you loose me.  Fact: people effect the environment. Fact: climate change occurs. Theory: People are melting the ice, raising the sea levels, increasing the worlds temperature and leading to global destruction. Please prove me wrong. Bill Nye makes the theory clear also but he is a little more honest in that he says \"People are the \"likely\" reason\". Subtle but it is there. You really have no facts to indicate that the Climate change is other than natural and will have an other than natural outcome. So believe what you will but don't lie and call your beliefs facts. Why make a video to tell others how to think and how to make an argument for your belief if it was fact? The facts stand on their own.

{"cid": "UgzEHTffD7viQbSTMBp4AaABAg.9ArxkMe0xFS9B-ihCL8Bnf", "text": " @Dundoril  Average temperature is just a mathematical invention. If you say, Sun can only heat Earth's surface to an average temperature of -18°C, what is this mean? This is nothing close to reality. Moon's average surface temperature is -20°C, but in reality you have temperature span from 120°C during Moon's day and -170°C during Moon's night.\r\nAnd same problem we have with Earth. Earth's surface temperature is -18°C, if Earth would not have atmosphere. So, max and low temperatures would be about the same as on Moon.\r\nNow let's look what climate science is doing.\r\nThey are treating Earth as if it was flat. They give entire Earth's surface same temperature. Entire earth's surface have the same amount of incoming solar energy. There is no day and night cycle, no difference in solar radiation between the equator and the pole. No Earth's tilt. Everything is average.\r\nAccording to climate science, surface that adding heat faster than atmosphere can dissipate it, the temperature will go up. OK, I have no problem with that, I totally agree. This is how climate scientists think that Earth's average surface temperature get from -18°C to 15°C hence, atmosphere is warming the planet's surface, more specific greenhouse gases. And this temperature rise is called the greenhouse effect.  BUT! Only because climate science treat Earth as if it was flat.\r\nhttp://mpe.dimacs.rutgers.edu/images/climate-system-energy-balance/\r\nThat means that entire earth's surface is receiving continuously flow of incoming solar energy, that means that entire earth's surface continuously emitting heat with equal strength into atmosphere and if atmosphere can't dissipate it fast enough, the temperature will go up! We have greenhouse effect!\r\nSorry to tell you but Earth's surface is not an average value. There is no square meter on Earth's surface that receive continuously flow of incoming solar energy non-stop. So, it can not emit constant heat to atmosphere. Longer the night, less heat it emits... it's cooling down.\r\nThe temperature during a day here on Earth is all Sun's work. Atmosphere don't help one bit to warm the earth (It actually prevent to be even hotter) during a day. But night is a different story. Surface that was heated during a day by Sun, emits it during a night in a form of long-wave radiation and what intercepts this? A water vapor and some little good ol' CO2. Problem is that CO2 and water vapor intercept just a part of this outgoing long-wave radiation. They can't completely stop the cooling proces. \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMWUK4WGkk&list=PLX2gX-ftPVXVzU5jGY3FaYEuuu3ANvMZb&index=21\r\nWater vapor do main bulk of work, CO2 helps a little, methane effect is so small and overlaps with water vapor. CO2 effect is almost already at max.\r\nAll and all! ''Greenhouse gases'' just slow down the cooling of the Earth's surface during a night, and not actually warm it.\r\nYou see, CO2 is harmless.

We have more instances of strong wind and wild weather in the 21st century compared to any other time. Not that they suddenly start occurring, but the rate at which incidents of strong wind  occurred increased. For example, one year, there were 160 incidents of strong wind. The next year, there were 500 incidents of strong wind. In this case, the rate of strong wind increased, yet strong wind was never suddenly born. Stop denying that the rate went up. Try this: Plot the number of named storms(all of them are significant) using a bar graph in which the x axis shows every year and the y axis shows the number of named storms in any given year. You will see that there is a trend of named storms going up. Named storms don't suddenly come in, but the rate at which they form slowly increases. As you can see, 2005 is an outlier, but the number of named storms  is slowly(or quickly depending on how you see the bar graph) going upwards. This debunks why I am correct. Using a bit of actual evidence, I can piece together that the rate of named storm formation is actually increasing(neat, isn't it). Also, you can compare the total number of named storms today with the 1990s. There is a very big increase. Tropical storms shouldn't even be a thing--they should be classified as hurricanes, because tropical storms are very dangerous(here in Brooklyn a building collapsed from Isaias and a tree fell on an elderly person, causing him to die). I'm thinking that you don't live in a place with tropical storms because you don't seem to understand how dangerous they are. Even with remnants of storms, there is costal flooding even with gale warnings mixed in. You can expect at least 2 inches of rain.

I checked my local weather, and on days that were partly cloudy(and no rain), the highs were 3 degrees lower and the lows(temperature measured at night) were 7 degrees colder than a cloudless night. Explain this if you believe in the contrary. It's not about humidity causing hot or cold temperatures. Because deserts have no water, it is rare for it to rain. Mountains are also blocking the path for storm systems to end up there. The moisture falls down before it reaches to the desert. the effects by CO2, NO2 and CH4 are much greater than water vapor(hundreds to thousands time the effect of water vapor). Our atmosphere acts as a buffer zone between the heat from the sun and the pleasant temperatures on earth. For example, mercury is hot because it is close to the sun and it has no atmosphere. Mars, on the other hand is very cold because it is far away from the sun. I doubt you even understand how greenhouse gases cause the earth to warm up. Water, which is H2O, has a slightly negative charge at the O and a slightly positive charge at the H. This is because the electronegativity of H is much less than the electronegativity of O. Therefore, the electrons are much closer to O despite being a covalent bond. Because of this lopsidedness, the energy of the sun is turned into heat energy. This is why O2 and N2 aren't greenhouse gases. They are symmetrical in electronegativity. This means that they aren't able to release heat. Imagine H20 as a spring. when you push the ends of the spring together, you have a lot of potential energy, but when you release, the spring bounces back and forth.

It can only do this if the energy it is receiving has increased but we are told it has not. The logic seems to be that the radiation that interacts with greenhouse gases would pass straight through the atmosphere without warning it. Once the radiation is used by greenhouse gases to warm the atmosphere instead, the rate of energy leaving the Earth cannot change, if it did the Earth would no longer be in equilibrium with the energy from the Sun.

{"cid": "UgxliRccIsVLxbFm34R4AaABAg", "text": "18. To Make The World A Better Place\n\nHumans build homes to stay, while animals just live in caves, live in the open field or just dig mud and stay. We humans for making homes cut down trees of the forest and then build homes. By this trees are getting reduced. Nowadays many people do not have to eat. If humans too stopped building homes and live in the open forest, trees would grow everywhere and so many fruits would be in the trees. If this is done no living being humans or animals would starve, because at present when we cut trees, so many birds and many animals which eat the trees fruits and leaves have to find some another tree. We would have to build schools, colleges, hospitals because without that we can't help ourselves. For clothes just we should hand stitch and just use white colour, because if we colour the clothes, pollution occurs. No plastic buttons should be used, only rubber buttons should be used. If there are no homes people could go anywhere, no need for two neighbouring countries to fight for land dispute at countries boundaries. At present what we are doing it is polluting the world and one day a major earthquake, tsunami, super volcano would come and many lives would be lost. So if we too lived in the open forest there will be no pollution, also our foods would be without chemicals. The very important thing no living being would starve.\n\n19. We build homes to stay which is wrong\n\nPreviously the whole world was forest. When a home is built, that much forest is destroyed, at that place there was a tree or some grass which the animals would eat. Human population is increasing year by year. New homes have to be built always. One day the whole forest, agricultural land would be homes. How would we produce food grains. Well it would take many years, maybe 50000 years or more from now on, I don't know , but then do we have to continue what is not right. We should live in the open forest as animals live and we have to survive. We have to find how to survive without harming the environment. Is there any choice, there is no other choice, we have to stop building homes. If we keep on building homes, then one day the whole lands of the world would be homes. When we build homes, we need so many things like mud, sea mud, cement, iron. They have to be transported from one place to another. For transportation we need vehicles and then for vehicles to operate we need petrol, diesel, oil. To get petrol we have to make oil rig platforms in the sea or land. For digging petrol so many machines have to be made. We need iron to make machines. We have to set up factories to make machines. But if we don't build homes to stay and live in the open forest as animals live, then we do not need the above said things. The above said things which when created and used creates pollution. If we don't use them, pollution also won't occur. Previously in the past when humans did live in open forest or caves, at that time all the animals, birds did have plenty to eat the fruits and leaves of the trees. Even humans before knowing fire, certainly they used to eat raw foods and somehow lived their life. When humans started building homes, after that forests became homes, trees were cut down and then the animals have to find some another tree for their food. The same is going to happen to humans if we keep on building homes. Simply we have to understand that this is not practicable. \n\nIf all of the earth's land would be forest, no roads, everything muddy, not even mud roads, then for transportation we need horses, bullocks, elephants. If a person has to be taken to a hospital immediately then horses, etc. may not be able to reach us immediately. At that time we have to use small airplanes or helicopters that would reach us immediately.\n\nIf we live in the open forest rainy season and winter season would be a problem for us. We may find shelter under the trees so that we won't get wet but if we still get wet then we may have to use raincoats which is not made from plastic as plastic is a pollutant. In summer season we could find shelter from the sun by sitting under a tree. But if we are travelling what should we do. Living in the open forest seems very hard but we have to find out to live somehow. Research should be made on this on a large scale. At present we are researching life on other planets and finding how to settle on moon and mars and even if that is possible we will one day pollute moon and mars and then we would have to go to some other planets. So much money is being spent on that. That research should be stopped till the earth is ok and that money should be used for researching on how to live in the open forest.\n\n20. If We Have To Live In The Open Forest\n\nAt present if we have to live in the open forest, it is impossible. We would have to face many problems. If we demolished all our building's and homes, then all the rubble has to be cleared and what should be done with the rubble, all the rubble should be grinded till it is thin like sand and maybe if we buried the rubble in the ground, then at that place could we grow trees and plants, it may or may not be possible. This should be researched.\nI think previously before humans were evolved, how nature was and when humans started evolving they were also going by natural means. We maybe have to do that only to save our earth. Previously humans did not know to speak and also what knowledge the world possesses now was not their before. If we started living in the open forest and face countless number of problems, we may also find a solution to the problems soon maybe, it may not take long.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugzv7X5so_SPam90QW54AaABAg", "text": "11. For People's Losing Their Jobs Or Businesses\n\nIf many companies are shut down then jobs and businesses are lost. Many people's should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming and a book must be written about how much amount of food of any type a person should consume, to cook foods half or full, because if we eat too much of a thing then some problems arises due to that. The lands of the companies can be turned back to forests, trees can be planted or turned into a farm.\n\n12. To Stop Using Perfumes And Powders Which Is Not A Necessity\n\nWomen's could simply keep a flower in their hair instead of using perfumes and powders. For men, it can't be helped. For bad smell in body both men and women should exercise and sweat, it would reduce the bad smell.\nIf you stop using perfumes and powders, we don't need perfume and powder manufacturing companies. So many perfume and powder bottles need not be manufactured, cartoon boxes need not be manufactured for packing them and transportations can be reduced. All of this would result in less pollution.\n\n13. Could We Stop Drinking Cow's and Buffalo's Milk\n\nWhatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow's and buffalo's milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. \nFor infants whose mother's have died or mother's who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow's and buffalo's milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use lime with tea and coffee. A lime should be cut into a few pieces and cooked with tea and coffee or something else can be used instead of lime.\n\n14. Medicines To Be Produced In A Different Way\n\nWe manufacture tablet and syrup medicines in a manufacturing company. The tablet and syrup medicines have to be prepared in vast quantities and then tablets has to be packed in a packet and syrups in a bottle. Whatever the tablet and syrup medicines contain for any type of illness, they would have made it from some type of chemicals. Transportation is needed and many other things are also needed. The pollution and waste gases generated from these companies are so much. We should treat illness from natural foods, plants, leaves, fruits or grasses for small to medium types of illness. We should research what type of foods, plants, leaves, fruits or grasses should be given to eat to the ill person to cure their illnesses. The ill person would go to a doctor and the doctor would tell them what foods, etc., should be eaten so that their illness could get cured and how much amount of food has to be consumed. The person would buy those foods and consume it. Major or urgency types of illness for that we have to use allopathy only, as it may be risky for the patients with ayurvedic, homeopathic, and other forms of treatment. The world should research on this method and if this method works then we won't need so much medicines manufacturing companies, so much warehouses won't be needed to store the medicines, so much machines won't be needed to prepare the medicines, so much transportation won't be needed to transport the medicines to so many places and all the things related with it and so pollution could be avoided. We could turn all that places back to forests. These companies require so much boring underground water, the water when pumped out of the ground they flatten and sink the ground.\nBut we would need medicines manufacturing companies for things such as glucose bottles, syringes, injections and other things like that.\n\n15. A Manufacturing Company Which Is Not A Necessity For Human Beings, If It Is Stopped, Then We Have The Following Benefits\n\nWhen a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings, if it is stopped, then we have the following benefits.\nThat company which is built in a place, that much land is saved, machines does not have to be manufactured, for machines to operate oil is needed and many other things, for which we have to make oil manufacturing company and all other companies for all other things like cartoon boxes, plastic ropes and plastic cans, registers, pencil, pen, stationery products. To make cartoon boxes papers are required and to stick papers gums are required. To make gums so much dough is needed and caustic soda is needed. If we don't manufacture cartoon boxes then that dough can be eaten. Transportation is needed to deliver things to all the shops. Roads have to be constructed. For transportation we need vehicles and to operate vehicles petrol is needed, to get petrol we have to set up oil rig platforms in the sea or land and to deliver petrol to a petrol pump that petrol is needed to be put in a drum, a plastic drum has to be manufactured and then many ships have to be manufactured for shipping the petrol to all the places. For all this works so much land is lost and so much pollution is created, from that pollution humans, land animals, sea animals, aerial animals and earth is suffering. Also many transportation items which requires huge trucks for transportation a driver has to drive only at night and his day life is lost. Surely at night time driving the driver would become sleepy sometimes and accidents do happen. \nAll of this can be reduced and this will be our benefits if we stopped a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings. When you stop making a manufacturing company then all the problems related with it won't occur.\n\n16. Why We Should Manufacture Less Nutrient Foods Like Horlicks And Bournvita\n\nBournvita, Horlicks should be given to only persons who cannot exercise and are too weak. For others who have deficiency and are not too weak, they should eat natural foods and exercise so that the foods would get absorbed well in their body and their deficiency would be alright. If still they cannot exercise and get tired easily, they could do some light exercises or yoga in their spare time which would take long to get tired. If this is done, we won't have to prepare so many horlicks, bournvita and other nutrients foods like that. So then we don't have to prepare the plastic, glass or paper pack bottles and hence less pollution.\n\n17. To Reduce Television Time\n\nTelevision programs is for 24 hours a day. A human works for 8 hours a day, 1 hour for getting ready in the morning, travelling time assume for 2 hours a day, half an hour would be spent in relaxing, talking to friend's for half an hour, talking with family for half an hour, 1 hour spent in a park and sleeping time for 6 hours. Altogether 19 and half hours are spent for weekdays. So only 4 and half hours are left. In that why television is then for 24 hours. Well non working women's and students going to schools and colleges have extra free time. As television is for 24 hours now, then many students instead of spending their time in studying watch television more and study less. Non working women’s in their free time instead of watching television could do some other activities. Television should be shown in evening from 7pm to 8pm, cartoon shows should be shown for kids at that time. From 8pm to 9pm teenagers programs should be shown. From 9pm to 11pm programs should be shown for grown-up peoples. If you watch colour television for more than 2 hours, the rays coming from television affects your health and eyes.\n\nAt present due to problems going on in the world, 24 hours news channels are required. So we can keep news channels for 24 hours. Sports channels can also be shown for 24 hours. \n\nOn Saturdays and Sundays television can be shown for 9 to 11am in the morning and 2 to 5pm in the afternoon and 7 to 11pm in the evening.\n\nAlso in a year so many movies are made. In a year there are 52 weeks, so only 52 movies should be produced in one country. One Sunday one movie should be watched. Their should be no production of video or CD cassettes of the picture, only uploaded in the internet, so that if anyone wants to watch any movie again, they can download and watch it again. \n\nAlso if their are only 52 movies in a week, there would be less downloading of movies in the whole world due to which there would be less amount of internet radiation.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgwpdkPREWomj-qmaEV4AaABAg", "text": "1.\tMany Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. What about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. Well companies and people's on one side and the earth on one side, which should we save, the earth is more important.\n\n2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.\nThis must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth's pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won't even have to research on how to clear the earth's pollution.\n\n3. Pickles should not be stored\n\nMost of the people buy pickles to eat, while some make it at home. If pickles are bought from a store then a company has also to make glass bottles to store the pickles. If made at home then still glass bottles are required to store the pickles. \nBut if we make pickles at home and only cook how much is needed for one time then we won't need glass bottles to store the pickles. Glass bottles when manufactured it creates water pollution.\n\n4. We Should Stop Using Makeup Products\n\nMany women's all over the world do makeup. Makeup is not a necessity for humans. Instead of doing makeup to look beautiful, women's should do exercise daily. If they exercise and sweat, eat fruits daily, they would have less dead skins and be naturally beautiful. They could save so much money if they stop using makeup products. If this is done then all the makeup manufacturing companies can be shut down. In this way all the pollution resulting from the makeup manufacturing companies would also be stopped.\n\n5. How To Reduce Transportation In The World\n\nIf one country invents a thing and then exports it to other countries in the world, much transportation is needed. Instead of that the invented thing should be taught to every countries in the world. If done like this transportation would\nbe less needed. Only raw materials should be imported and exported\nfrom one country to another. Countries should not import and export eatable things if it can be produced in their own countries. If one country has excess agricultural food grains, fruits, then only that country should export that things to other countries. If this is done, so much pollution can be reduced because of less transportation.\nIf one country has invented a thing and they would think that if they taught other countries the method to invent that thing, then they would lose profits, but that will not be the case as other countries when they will invent a thing, they will also teach the method to invent that thing to all other countries in the world.\nIf pollution problem was not present then no problem, one country after inventing a thing could transport it to all other countries in the world, but now as pollution problem is present, then this should not be done.\n\n6. Electricity Pollution\n\nWe create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.\nAs I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not a necessity for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. Then maybe we could provide electricity to the whole world from windmill and Solar panels which are not pollutant. If we stopped producing electricity from coal, water, etc., then the pollution resulting from them won't occur. Shouldn't we take this step to protect our earth as already our earth is suffering so much from global warming and climate change. Is their any other choice, I don't think so. \nAt present the world is researching how to solve the pollution problem, it would take how many years I don't know and also would it possible or impossible, God knows. Could we wait till that time when scientists would find how to solve pollution problems and till that the earth won't have a major natural disaster, nobody knows. We must shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans.\n\n7. Free Things To The Peoples\n\nAs I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless. So to solve this problem the world has to make food, clothing, shelter, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government's of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people's who have lost their source of income, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.\n\n8. Firecrackers should be banned\n\nFirecrackers should be banned because it is harmful for animals. Animals have different levels of hearing and when we burst crackers which have a loud noise the dogs run away from that place. The dogs may hear the noise more louder than humans. When we fire the rocket cracker up in the sky and it bursts and if any bird is near to the explosion then that birds internal organs are damaged and they die just because of that explosion sound. Also peoples who have asthma illness, they face problems during Diwali. So much papers and threads are used in manufacturing crackers. The persons working in the manufacturing companies also suffer.\nNow when their are animals rights for not harming them, then this step of banning firecrackers must be taken.\n\n9. Hair cutting salons are not required\n\nInstead of cutting our hair and shaving our beard in a salon, if everybody learns how to cut hair, then in a family everybody can cut each other's hair. If this is done then no need of hair cutting salons. All those hair cutting places can be used for other purposes.\nWe require scissors, blades, razors, shaving brush and shaving creams for hair cut and beard shaving. What if we use a hair removing soap for our hair cut and shaving purposes. Their is a soap for hair removal and it is also cheap. For women's who need hair cut for them scissors has to be used to cut the hair, no choice for that, but for men's hair cut and beard shaving if hair removing soap is used, he would become bald, but if we do this then we won't need to manufacture blades, razors, shaving brush and creams. All those manufacturing companies can be shut down and hence less pollution for the world.\nPeople use hair dye to colour their hairs. The hair dye manufacturing companies after production dumps its waste in rivers or seas which pollutes the water. So all hair dye manufacturing companies should be shut down. For the sake of our planet earth this step must be taken.\n\n10. We Can Stop Eating Sweets, Cakes\n\nWe consume sweets and cakes. We make it from many things such as wheat, coconut, etc. and add sugar to it. But what we want is the sweet thing to consume which we are getting directly from fruits. The fruit is naturally sweet. So if we want to consume sweets and cakes, we do not have to prepare it, just we have to eat fruits. So all the sweet manufacturing companies can be shut down. If you shut down a sweet manufacturing company, then so many paper boxes need not be manufactured which are used to pack the sweets.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I agree that water vapour can absorb energy in the short term, making the difference between day and night temperatures less, but it cannot retain energy to make the Earth' s long term temperature higher than the temperature determined by the Energy from the Sun.

The maximum average temperature is determined by the sun, the orbit of the earth, the tilt of the earth, the distance to the sun, and the reflectivity of the earth. IF the earth was at the maximum temperature, it would not have any ice on the earth. Its way to complicated to say the temperature of the sun is the cause of warming or not.\nDuring the little ice age, the earth cooled as the result of increase reflectivity. This caused glaciers to expand as less ice melted in the summer than was laid down in the winter. After the little ice age ended, the reflectivity decreased and again and more of the suns energy was absorbed.

The CO2 Climate change debate is about changes in the very short term when the factors you mention are not significant. My understanding is that CO2 interacts with radiation around the 15 micrometre range and within the first 10mtrs of the surface it essentially converts the radiation into kinetic energy in the air molecules around it. Satellite data shows that radiation in this range  is not being emitted by the Earth into Space. I am confused by what you say about water, it requires significant energy to raise its temperature and consequently when it is no longer being heated it will take longer for its temperature to fall. The rate that energy transfers from warmer to cooler depends mainly on the temperature difference that exists. The point I am trying to make is that a change to Earth's atmosphere cannot result in a change in the energy leaving the planet.

It has a range of frequencies it can absorb. it has a range it can emit on, but it primarily emits on one. That frequency is one that water vapor absorbs readily. It can also convert energy it absorbs from collisions with other atoms into infrared energy and emit it as well. This means that it absorbs energy from water vapor and emits it as infrared.\nWhen the infrared is around water, such as the water in the body, it gets absorbed rapidly but when it is above the level in the atmosphere that water vapor exist, half of the energy it release leaves the planet. Increases in co2 results in increases in the infrared leaving the planet.\nThere is a balance of energy that the earth receives and emit, but for the last 3 centuries the balance has been negative, i.e. the earth is retaining a good bit of the energy it receives. That energy is being stored in the water as it is warmed from ice to liquid. Its easier to think of water as the earth heat battery. When the earth loses its heat charge, the water freezes. When the earth energy recharges, the ice melts.\n\"The Earth has to stay in equilibrium with the energy it receives from the Sun.\" THis only happens if there earth is at maximum temperature for its position in the solar system and its angle.

I think to  understand the logic of the videos you need to follow them from the start. The other series on Radiation is also a good introduction into how energy transfers through radiation.

NASA satellites has shown an increase in infrared leaving the planet as co2 increases. In the early 1980's and late 1970's alarmist were insisting that co2 would increase the temperature of the stratosphere. \nSOME (not many) people said co2 would not rise to the stratosphere. NASA countered by pointing to the increase in infrared coming from the stratosphere as proof. The rest of the \"deniers\" pointed out that this increase proved that co2 was not trapping heat, and NASA stopped talking about it.\nWater vapor does not release infrared unless it gets really hot. As it rises in the atmosphere because of the heat, the water vapor encounters less air pressure and thus lower temperatures, meaning it will have more trouble releasing the energy via infrared. It can easily lose that energy via convection when low energy co2 hits it. Co2 can easily release the energy via infrared (as long as it is vapor, not dry ice). So in the upper atmosphere, a \"cold\" co2 will hit the water vapor, release its infrared causing it to be cold again and hit another water vapor molecule. Half of that infrared will head upwards, and since it will be above the water vapor at that point, will not be reabsorbed.\nWhat I meant by your understanding was not correct is that 18% of the earths radiation will travel through the atmosphere because it is frequencies that the atmosphere can not absorb, but the rest will be absorbed. The distance it can travel depends on thickness of the ghg. As an example, in Antarctica, where there is no water vapor, increases in co2 causes the temperature to drop because there is  so little ghg to absorb it. Water vapor is the ghg that absorbs more of infrared the earth releases.\nThe biggest problem is that you seemed to believe that the earth is in equilibrium. IF the earth received EXACTLY as much energy as it released, it would not change its temperature. NASA has shown that there is a small discrepancy between the receiving and losing energy, resulting in the earth warming. As co2 increases the discrepancy decreases.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "robert hicks", "channel": "UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQX_Kr-fKitOz9Nc8sixfpX3X4HSVG9l2zq1A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What the temperature will be is determined by the amount of energy absorbed rather than reflected by the object. Clearly if the energy reflected increases the temperature will be lower. Similarly if the energy of from the source changes the temperature will change. It is the idea that a body can retain energy to increase its temperature and as a result appear cooler to an outside observer (less energy being radiated implies a lower temperature) I find difficult to accept. If a body increases in temperature as a result of retaining energy, it must in turn radiate more energy. It cannot be warmer and radiate less.

For instance Mercury is tidal locked, meaning it always shows the same face to the sun and the other side always faces away. This means the surface facing the sun is always the same temperature and the face away is always the same.\nThe earth is different. Clouds, snow and such reflect the sun's light on a continually changing pattern. The energy that the earth absorbs is there fore constantly changing. When more energy is reflected and radiated than is absorbed, the water loses its energy thus enters a lower state, i.e. ice. Then when the earth absorbs more than it reflects+radiates, the water stores more energy and thus changes to the liquid state.\nWhat this means is the the equilibrium is not stable. In the long term, the amount of energy that is reflected and radiated will match the energy the earth receives. BUT for the short term, there is no equilibrium. IF you were to take the total energy over a million years, it would be so close that it would have to be said to be the same BUT over short term, like a century or even a thousand years, no, it is too variable.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "robert hicks", "channel": "UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQX_Kr-fKitOz9Nc8sixfpX3X4HSVG9l2zq1A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwY6MtnUHCOb8NJtNZ4AaABAg", "text": "Climate change is only small not as they are putting it all over the media. The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly  up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

If 400ppm is 1 degree C, the next degree takes an additional 800ppm,  the next 1600ppm.   Sea levels are not rising in fact in many places they are decreasing. World-leading sea-level expert Prof. emeritus Nils Axel Mörner presents some stark examples that show how the IPCC and climate activists are wildly exaggerating their claims of rapid sea level rise. Mörner studied the Kattegat Sea between Denmark and Sweden. In this region, sea level has not increased as announced by climate alarmists but instead decreased. Stockholm’s tide record is the second longest in Europe; the mean long-term change in sea level is a decline of 3.8 mm per year.  In addition, Every temperature chart published shows CO2 lagging temperature change not driving it.  Every model produced by these \"scientists\" is completely wrong and had they not faked the historical data making it colder, the change in temperatures would be even less than we have.  The only model anywhere near a real reduction is the Russian atmospheric model.  Every model produced by others has been proven drastically wrong.   Please, No more anecdotal evidence,   you are going to have to show me the hard data, not the proverbial \"hot air\" explanations.  BTW,  water vapor is the 90% driver of atmospheric temperature change as every cloud has a latent heat exchange warming the atmosphere.

During the end-Triassic extinction 200 million years ago, for example, CO2 values jumped from about 1,300 ppm to 3,500 ppm thanks to massive volcanic eruptions in what is now the central Atlantic.

But consider what happens when more CO2 is released from outside of the natural carbon cycle – by burning fossil fuels. Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in millions of years.

I'm all right jack blow you! We have less than 15 years may be less than 5 as change is rapidly increasing, What are they not telling the public in fear of panic and enoki. We must change today not tomorrow.

{"cid": "UgxsRYR_n3I8WAPUpCh4AaABAg", "text": "Naive Malarky. CO2 has risen to levels not seen in twelve million years. Yet temperatures haven't budged one bit from the last twelve thousand year Holocene interglacial average. Temperatures have been naturally increasing since the Little Ice Age in the 1600s. The thermometer was invented in an uptrend one hundred years later. A natural uptrend that has only reached halfway up the natural historical pattern of the Holocene. The thermometer hasn't been around long enough to understand how much today's climate is completely normal. In our current Holocene interglacial, temperatures have risen and fallen at least four degrees C (~8 degrees F) at least a dozen times. Today we're right in the middle of that twelve thousand year range. The late twentieth century coincidental rise of CO2 with temperature is just that - coincidental. Temperatures rose just as much and just as fast during the early twentieth century before any significant CO2 rise. The temperature change is completely normal. The CO2 increase is not. (normal CO2 during our Holocene interglacial has been 180-280ppm) probably from a combination of fossil fuel use and aggressive land clearing. But since CO2 is NOT THE CONTROL KNOB OF CLIMATE, has an increase in CO2 been harmful or beneficial? The answer is COMPLETELY BENEFICIAL. A little more CO2, in the context of the 600 million year natural decline of CO2 from 7000ppm to today's natural near lethally low levels, a little more CO2 has been a Godsend.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Barry Bateman", "channel": "UCNsbXZGeUaRQ5UXXjLxm0LQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRffMziUml6dZLje-hHQez13Nf8EAxpxole8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Heat up 2 lb of copper of 5000 pounds of copper is nothing!   My second point is sublimation.    Co2 will not condense into a liquid.  IT DOES ON VENUS BUT not ON EARTH OR MARS! \nThey point to Venus and say the co2 is responsible for its 900-degree heat.  Venus has 90 times the pressure of Earth and will allow its co2 to be effective as a greenhouse gas!\n\n\n  When Mars has roughly the same amount of c02 concentration and is ineffective in heating Mars.  The difference is Sublimation ie Pressure allows the co2 in venus to condense into a liquid.  Mars and Earth do not have enough pressure for co2 to condense.  Dry ice goes from solid to gas skipping the liquid phase.   It is why science and the physics on Earth does not consider Oxygen or nitrogen or Argon as a greenhouse gas.     \nThe reason is you cannot blame water vapor that is the major greenhouse gas because water vapor does confidence.   Water in the state of Ice will melt into a liquid then to a gas phase and it reverses the same.   \n\n\nYessssssss! the earth is heating up!  but co2 is not the reason. The earth has been heating up since the last Ice age.. and Yes faster right now... Reason?

The reality is that heat is the catalyst for expanding CO2, not the other way around. Anyone that makes this claim was obviously sleeping during 7th grade science lab. Further more, plants thrive on CO2. And for those of you that were sleeping through 3rd grade science class, plants convert CO2 into oxygen through a process called Photosynthesis. \nThe earth has been through many warming and cooling cycles since the it's creation. And at worst, the current global temperatures are very mediocre compared to our past. \nSolar cycles  always correlate to the Earths warming and cooling periods. This also explains why the Mars polar ice sheets were melting at the same time the earths glaciers were melting. \nThe good news is that the earths glaciers and sea ice packs are now seeing record growth and the hole in the ozone layer is now shrinking. The bad news is that we are at the precipice of a Grand Solar Minimum. This means much longer and colder winters resulting in crop failures. Already a long winter last year shortened the global growing season by 5 weeks. That combined with record breaking low temperatures and snowfall during the fall harvest has resulted in massive crop losses in the United States and other parts of the world. \nMake no mistake cold kills in more ways than one.

{"cid": "Ugysja1zL1cJryXkTud4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

It’s only 400 parts per million in the whole of the earths atmosphere. That is 0.04 percent CO2 only in the whole atmosphere. From that only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is fossil fuel CO2, not even a fart in the wind. We are being misled to believe that that tiny tiny amount is causing a climate emergency. Climate alarmists are funded by billionaire greens and know nothing about climate science and ignore all facts too. The ice cores clearly show in the past that sometimes the temperature has been much higher than today, and also some of those times CO2 levels were even lower than today. You are right too about CO2 following temperature change and not causing it, with an average 800 year lag. It’s also been as high as 8000 parts per million too, and the more CO2 the greener the planet as CO2 is the gas of life. The ice cores show that too. It’s all about taxing us more in the name of CO2 and the billionaire elites getting even richer at our expense. They say hottest since records began etc etc. Very conveniently their records only start from the late 18 hundreds to the early 19 hundreds when we began slowly coming out of the end of the last mini ice age. They completely ignore the records before then as they would blow their puny short time scale charts out the window. They mainly predict through computer models which have all been wrong and exaggerated too. Notice some millionaires in the man made climate hoax are building their mansions on beaches that they said would be under water 20 years ago, one name springs to mind ! We had a small cooling period in the 60 s to 70s and warned of a coming ice age if we don’t warm the planet up. Then it naturally started to warm slightly again and called it global warming and warned us to cool the planet.

Mathematics and logic are both closed, self-contained systems of propositions, whereas science is empirical and deals with nature as it exists.  The primary criterion and standard of evaluation of scientific theory is evidence, not proof.  All else equal (such as internal logical consistency and parsimony), scientists prefer theories for which there is more and better evidence to theories for which there is less and worse evidence.  Proofs are not the currency of science.\n\nProofs have two features that do not exist in science:  They are final, and they are binary.  Once a theorem is proven, it will forever be true and there will be nothing in the future that will threaten its status as a proven theorem (unless a flaw is discovered in the proof).  Apart from the discovery of an error, a proven theorem will forever and always be a proven theorem.\n\nIn contrast, all scientific knowledge is tentative and provisional, and nothing is final.  There is no such thing as final proven knowledge in science.  The currently accepted theory of a phenomenon is simply the best explanation for it among all available alternatives.  Its status as the accepted theory is contingent on what other theories are available and might suddenly change tomorrow if there appears a better theory or new evidence that might challenge the accepted theory.

I was making a general comment on how the public tends to view and interpret scientific data. And specifically in regards to climate change, this is causing a state of panic and mob-mentality. This has led people to blindly assume, in the name of science, that humans will go extinct. Considering such drastic consequences, based on so little we know about climate science, a field already riddled with so many unknown unknown variables, warrants additional skepticism. Again, I'm not saying climate scientists are wrong (in fact, they're more likely to be right than anyone else on this world), but I would be much more hesitant before jumping to extreme conclusions as to what and to what degree those effects will be.As for my personal opinion on climate change, I'm still trying to find a stance, which is why I was watching this video. I do believe that there is a good chance that climate change is real and that humans influenced it, but the outcome of these events (extinction, or other extreme consequences), to me, seem way over exaggerated. I do, however, full heartedly support making changes to have a cleaner environment, for health reasons and to stay on the cautious side.

IF you increase their cost, such as a tax, then they have to pass it on to their customer. They can not eat the cost, or it means they have a lost. IF they lose money for long, they go bankrupt.\n\nLets say there is a company making donuts. That company has a gas fired oven for banking. They buy flour and sugar, and other farmed products.\n\nThe government adds a carbon tax to the farmers, flour mills, the shippers and to the gas company. The farmers have to get more money, or they lose the farm. The mills first have to pay more for the wheat, then get taxed for their carbon use and they have to get more money for their flour. Others have to pay more for sugar, and for their production of the sugar. Then the stores have to pay more for the flour and sugar, so the baker has to pay more for their product or go out of business. On top of that they have an increase in taxes because of their stove.\n\nThe result is the cost of the donuts go up by 50% to pay for all the taxes. That means the customers pay more for a tax that is not put on them.\n\nYou are not told the truth about co2. \n1) It is a very tiny part of the atmosphere, only .0004 part of the atmosphere.\n2) it is not a ghg in the same way that water vapor is. H2o can not release much in the way of infrared but co2 is. That is the reason we have co2 lasers and not h2o lasers. In fact, co2 lasers are the most common lasers in the industry. Low powered ones are used for alignment and high power are used for cutting materials. They can be used to drill very precise holes in steel or tougher metals. They are even used by the navy to knock down missiles on some of their newer ships.\n\nWhat co2 is, is a REGULATORY gas. That means if the temperature is low, it helps to slow temperature leaving the planet, but it if gets too high it helps to get rid of the excess.\n\nNasa satellites have proven that increasing co2 increases the amount of energy that is leaving the planet.\n\nThose experiments are designed to fool you. The fact is, co2 emits infrared in a small range of frequency, which is absorbed by h2o. Those cups have both co2 and h2o. This means the co2 will absorb the infrared, then the glass prevents that infrared from leaving the jar. Instead it gets absorbed by the water vapor and thus warms the jar.\n\nIF you do the same experiment without the water vapor AND with walls that are transparent to infrared, it does NOT heat up.\n\nYES you can make models that will tell you anything they are designed to show you. IF you program the model to show that the atmosphere has a sensitivity of over 2°, it will show a major increase. If on the other hand, you program it to show a sensitivity of less than 1° it does not do so.\n\nHere is the rub. EVERY model with a sensitivity of greater than 1° is off in 20 years. The way to test a model is to take the data from the past, say 100 years ago, and see if it matches what happened. Not one of their models can do that. They cant even do it if you give it the data from 20 years ago.\n\nThere is one model that can accurately predict the preset. It was created in the late 1940, and it totally ignore co2. After 70 years, its prediction are only off by +1°, i.e. it said it would be 1° hotter than it is.\n\nThis model was created using the melting of the glaciers as the CAUSE of global warming, not the result. They noted that there is evidence of a 60 year cycle, and other smaller cycles (12, 5, and 6 year cycles). When they ran these cycles, they got almost the exact warming we have had for the almost 80 years since.\n\nIn other words, the only model that has been proven to be closest to reality, is one that has an atmospheric sensitivity to changes in co2 of zero.\n\nYes, we have never increased co2 this fast, but the temperature is going up just the same as it in the first half of the 1900's.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "robert hicks", "channel": "UC0TPdvG3xiLwzMJbdJzNw5g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQX_Kr-fKitOz9Nc8sixfpX3X4HSVG9l2zq1A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That land area around have lot of dead animals and other biologic materials stored in permafrost that didn't melt for 500 000years. Now is started to melt. Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2.\nWe have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get  even more gas. The reason why   this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans.\nIf we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land  so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise ..

(I say most likely because its not 100%.. but more like 90% proven, close enough for me, I say that because we didn't have the means to measure a lot of things back then)\r\n\r\nok, so now we come to the heart of the problem, CO2 does not act in the way that most people believes it does, CO2 absorbs only very specific wavelengths, 2.7, 4.3, and 15 microns, once absorbed it then radiates them in every direction almost instantly (this happens in 83 femtoseconds) in completely different wavelength that fluctuates but the average is about 25 microns, meaning they are not re absorbed by other CO2 molecules, with the current amount of CO2 this all happens in about 10 meters, meaning that those 3 wavelengths never make it to the ground... then once IR reflects off the ground... those three wavelengths make it about 10M off the ground before they are all absorbed and changed into another wavelength... thus  all of the suns energy absorbed during the day leaves through the atmosphere during the night.\r\n\r\nif we where to double the amount of CO2 the same process would happen in about 5M instead of 10M I can explain this mathematically if you wish.  what does this really mean?

That land area around have lot of dead animals and other biologic materials stored in permafrost that didn't melt for 500 000years. Now is started to melt. Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2.\nWe have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get  even more gas. The reason why   this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans.\nIf we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land  so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise ..

And stating, \"well it is\" doesn't prove your point either. I could just say, \"Well it isn't,\" and that has just as much validity as your statement. But with a hypothetical, I'll show you why it's not the worst thing that could happen to humans. \n\r\nIf a war were to break out that is so massive most governments stop functioning properly and crime is the norm, from torture to murder and so forth. And this lasts for generations. Would you prefer that reality or extinction? Choosing extinction means you agree extinction is not the worst possible scenario for humans. \n\r\nAnd to actually detail my point originally, it's not to diminish Climate Change's importance and our job to stop it, but that it could take quite awhile for it to actually become a critical extinction danger for humans, though of course other animals like polar bears are already affected much more and will be extinct far sooner than us, and that is definitely something worth stopping but doesn't make it such a critical danger (yet) for humans. \r\n\r\nThough also, the most significant impact any individual can have on climate change, is to have a plant-based / Vegan diet. The last time I checked (about a year or two ago) Animal Agriculture is the LEADING cause of green-house gas emissions, even more than all the world's transportation combined. Veganism is when you care for the animals and that's why you don't eat animal products, but even if you don't care about them, being plant-based (which is the same as Veganism but without you caring for animals) is beneficial to you and the world because it is the best thing any individual can do if you really want to stop or slow down climate change.

{"cid": "Ugy04GwVaPDvusP0qF54AaABAg", "text": "ok So most normal people believe that the earth is warming, You loose some people when you say that we are the cause, although most normal people will say we at least contribute to the problem. You loose more when you say if we get rid of fossil fuels the problem is solved, because most normal scientist will tell you they can't guarantee that it will stop global warming. As mentioned the earth was a lot warmer before humans were even alive. I have no issues with moving towards cleaner air and water, however I do not go along with the green new deal who do not take into account for money, jobs and poor planning. Because if you don't plan properly and you don't test ideas in small areas, you can do more harm than good. The easiest would example would be to go back to the 80's when we were all told that plastic bags were going to save the planet. That paper bags and packaging were causing irreputable harm to the environment due to deforestation. It was scientist who told us this along with conservationist. How did that work out? I don't think most of you realize how bad the chemicals are that go into solar panels. Electric cars are really Coal burning cars at this point in time. So let's all not panic, Work hard to find good solutions. Test them in small areas until we sure they won't do more harm and go forward. By the way you don't need the government to do anything, for you to use less fossil fuels. Get a small car or motor cycle or better yet rid a peddle bike. Switch to LED lighting. Shut off your cable box because it uses more electricity than any other appliance in your house.(unless you have a 1970's fridge). Use reusable bags. Take public transportation.  There are a million little things all of us can do to use less energy. If your not than you are part of the problem. Be the solution. Be an inspiration to others to use less energy. Don't be someone on a pedestal preaching to others.

Revolutionary Technology that Could Change world Destiny\n\nworld is suffering from a massive deficit  causing losses of agriculture, and losses of hundreds of lives of poor farmers committing suicides throughout mother planet Reservoirs in several states this year have already reached dead storage level which will also result in severe fall in hydro electricity generation, causing even industrial output to come to a standstill. Artificial rainfall inducing methods through cloud seeding . A team developed indigenous formula with the help of natural herbal pulp which is three years process.\n We believe that the government must look at alternative solutions where certain either to unknown technologies can be explored to overcome this grim situation. Here there for we would like to offer our survey, Observation and experiment based solutions to climate  where every effort. With observations and surveys  over 26 years we have gathered sufficient data and knowledge through which we strongly believe we can produce unfailing rains in areas spread over hundreds of square kilometers.\nOur experiments have shown us that the micro physical processes involved in the formation of weather can be suitably altered to increase atmospheric precipitation in the lower levels of the troposphere causing formation of Stratus and Cumulus clouds which could further progress and develop to Nimbostratus clouds yielding heavy rain over vast areas running into hundreds of square kilometers. Through our experiments of years we believe we now have the technology to create cloud formation . observation a team of our people spent extensive periods of time to identify what caused rain clouds,  We have concluded in years of observation that clouds have been forming mostly over specific types of trees translating into rain.\nWe have discovered that certain types of vegetation have immense powers of gathering humidity and causing condensation to form rain bearing clouds. This became the basis of our experiments and hence to establish to the world the rain causing potent of these trees, we have created a biological amalgamation using a base of these ingredients. This blend which we have created, when exposed to sunlight for a few days over certain spots, at certain heights, has a tremendous effect in creating clouds allowing them to precipitate into rainfall. . We have also developing several methodologies through which rain clouds can also be moved to a few hundred kilometers from one area to another where there is a serious deficit. There are comprehensive technicalities involved in the entire process to explain. However we will be able to physically demonstrate the  a While we admit that we ourselves do the science these processes, we are yet able to produce  successfully through our experiments.\nOur claims of creating this revolutionary mechanism have been laughed at, since this whole process has the potency to change weather and therefore the world itself. However we affirm that our experiments have produced positive results and have strengthened our determination. We have thence strongly resolved to demonstrate this technology to the world now.

These are not small numbers I know but I say “only” because the overwhelming majority believe we are causing climate change. So the issue isn’t so much denial anymore as what to do about it.   It certainly seems to me that humans are causing climate change. My issue with the climate crusaders side of this argument is the insistence that renewable energy sources that don’t work or even do more environment harm are going to solve our problems.  \n\nSolar produces CO2 free energy (kinda), but what happens when they are used up, obsolete, or damaged?  Off to China with the rest of the e-waste.  That’s just ONE simple example of many that shows what’s wrong with current renewable energy technology. \n\nPoint is these are complex problems that aren’t easy to solve and many of the climate crusaders as guilty as of putting on blinders to the facts as the climate deniers.

The extremes in weather and also natural disasters like tornados, fire and so on will cause that there'll be not enough food. This can cause other extremes in civilisation, everything is possible. \nBtw obviously other possibilities which could cause climate change have been tested as well. E.g. the sun became even colder since the measurements. \nClimate change, especially caused by emissions caused by humanity, has been predicted since centuries and they were always proven right when s.o. tried to falsify it. It is therefore even one of the safest theories that exist. The only thing which is practically impossible to calculate is HOW FAST EXACTLY till it's too late and most life on earth will be dead. This is obviously too complex to calculate. So it's a scientific fact that we must do something as fast as possible, cause it might be soon/already too late. For too long the oil/and other industries could prevent the USA to do something against it. And it is of course possible to live without oil/or only use it very rarely for some plastic things which really can't be replaced by something else for now.

I left but thunder and lightning followed and it rained like that for almost 3 months. That was my last good memory of a proper rain pattern. It would always come on time, either the first week of April or the last week of May. Last year, I saw very little rain. It would rain for 3 days a week and then it would be dry again. I miss the scent of rain clouds. It almost never rains during the day time anymore here. Only during night.

Otherwise, I think we're capable of spontaneously wanting to do good. It's just that it's a lot easier etc. if the systems of human interaction, such as economics or politics, are set up to encourage it. In other words, to get deep change in human behaviour, it really helps strategically to have the law on your side. So political organisation is required for effective change. But that won't click in, I pessimistically think, until the reptures in life around the industrialised world due to CC etc mean that we know we have more to gain than to lose by changing those systems. And by then, of course, it will be too late. But if you can be more optimistic than me, more power to you, buddy.\nPersonally I think we need to break our economic dependence on industry. This means society learning to live without needing to economically expand. And since capitalism requires expansion in order for its economics to work (as result of the profit motive), that means things will get really bad before changing industrialised economics will obviously be less damaging to those economies than not changing it. \nThe degree of future damage is mitigated by all the good actions we do now. However, I don't think non-law-affecting action can stop the eventual collapse of the global economy, and a century or so of bloody global chaos as a result. It's even more regretable due to the fact that we can see the collapse coming but not clearly enough to make enough of us want to change enough of our behaviour to stop it. But again, that's why we need law on our side. (Once the political aspect clicks in you're well into the cycle of political revolution. That's another story.

He stated (at 3:44) that from 1900 until today that the average temperature in the world has increased 1 degree. And then concluded that within the next 100 years we will see a temperature increase from 2.4 to 4.8%, and a subsequent increase in sea level by 1 meter.  Politically I’m “independent” so I don’t have a dog in the political fight - but rather I’m seeking the truth.\n\nBecause I’m over 50 years old, I’ve been around long enough to see a lot of scientific “facts” turn out to be wrong.  And while I love science, I also am enamored with the study of human behavior.  That being said, I’ve seen waaaaay too many scientists start off with the conclusion, and then try and prove what they already believe to be true.  I just found out that there’s actually a term for it, “confirmation bias”. (It’s when you form an opinion and then you create a theory. And then you work hard to prove it).  Does anyone remember when “killer bees” were going to wipe out North America, and it was a sure thing?  Or when it was determined as fact that the “walking catfish” in Florida bodies of water were going to wipe out the entire fish ecosystem throughout the U.S.?  I’m not doubting some of these facts, especially the CO2 situation.......but can someone point me to a better source of information that does more than leap from the 1 degree historical temperature change, to the 2.5 - 5% that is “certainly” coming our way? (While I do have a skeptical eye, I am teachable and want to know the science of what we know and don’t know about the future climate change situation........and help is GREATLY appreciated!!).

{"cid": "UgxnB0wRUIxFCLaLPWp4AaABAg", "text": "This video is condescending and Full of lies. The warmest decade was in the 30s but of course the climate change people ignore that information so they can make their little models work, well we know how good the models are because they have missed the mark on every model they produced.  Their models are all made by academics who have no idea what they’re doing. If you build a model that has garbage going into it you get garbage going out. That’s the way of models. For any model to be working properly and it needs to be validated. The correlations they put in for CO2 versus temperature are basically created out of nothing.  If CO2 was driving temperature and the CO2 has doubled why has there not been a sharper increase in temperature. The temperature is been rising almost at the same rate since 1950 after a declining Before that. Yet  these liars will tell you that it’s jumping at 10 times normal. So they agreed temperature was rising that it’s just about how fast. Using the scientific principle you change one variable to see how the other responds. Well we’ve been fortunate in the case of CO2 because it has doubled and yet the temperature is almost flat in relative terms. Why is it not doubling in fact if you look back in the ice record You do see a correlation between temperature and CO2. Some might say the temperature is leading and other say CO2. But this is the first time there’s been a dramatic departure and we know CO2 is leading. What else do you need to know if CO2 was driving the temperature it should be off the scale. But it’s not. He starts off by mentioning polar bears yet the polar bear population is thriving and has reached its highest in Decades.  Perfect example of anecdotal data they used to try and scare people thinking the planet is coming to an end or at least life on the planet. They are the climate change pug who cried Wolf and soon it will all come crashing down as they’re running out of time to steal your money in the name of saving the planet from global catastrophe. Yes it is about global catastrophe because the globalist on the planet want to eliminate borders and the only way they can do it is to find a cause that everybody can get behind. Don’t give up your sovereignty to the united nation clowns. The real sad part here is they want to dedicate resources that could go to feeding people housing people and making clean air. Travel to some of the poorest countries in the world and you can’t see across the street. Much of it comes from the burning of organics such as wood and whatever else they can get their hands on. That’s not CO2 in the air. It costs millions of lives every year and yet they want to focus on a gas that has no affect on health. This behaviour is verging on criminal. He also states that the Oceans are more acidic. The oceans are not acidic, They are basic about 8.2. He refers to the Arctic ice is shrinking but then makes an extremely revealing confession that 1400 years ago the ice was the same as it is now. So how is it that if it’s so extremely warm now that the Arctic ice was in the same condition 1400 years ago yes you get to see the picture this is not an unusual thing on the planet to have the Arctic ice recede. He does talk about sea level rising .1 inches a year. Wow like that hasn’t happened before. The oceans have risen 300 m since the last Ice Age .1 inches a year doesn’t seem that a normal does it. He throws in a comment about how icebergs seem to be disappearing or at least the ice shelves are disappearing. Last time I checked That was a natural process where the icebergs flow off the continents into the water where they disappear. What he fails to mention is that all of those ice sheets that are supposedly going to cause the oceans to rise are already floating. And the last time I checked when floating ice melts it doesn’t increase the level of the water. And guess what folks the average temperature at the South Pole is minus 56 deg f so it’s not going to melt. He finishes off with A wild statement that the ocean is going to rise a metre which is catastrophic to people on the earth. Well I would say that’s a huge overstatement in that very few people are going to be affected by an ocean rise of a metre even if it did happen. And right now people in Miami are betting against that because it’s some of the most expensive property in the world.

How you all sound (but a couple comments are in the know). The earth's climate changes...that's a fact. The earth's warming and cooling cycles are actually tract and we have been much warmer in previous centuries (surprise) when there was no CO2, etc. If any are really curious about the truth and are interested in educating yourselves go watch the youtube video \"The Dark Winter 640\" by Dr. John Casey a former NASA climatologist who has been ringing the hoax bell for decades. Oh yes, the change from global warming to climate change (how convenient). At first, I think the UN's scientists (the UN is where all the climate change computers are kept) was sincere though driven by greed. When it was obvious to them the warming period was coming to an end they started parameterizing the data into the software of the climate change computers. In other words, they fudge the numbers to get the results they want and switched the fear mongering cry from global warming to climate change. This reminds me of when the French sold the idea of bottled water to the Americans. What a concept, now thousands liter our earth with plastics unintentionally yearly and poison themselves with mini plastic from regular use of drinking from plastic containers.\n\nWhat we really need to do is clean up our planet. That doesn't mean we have to throw our gas cars away either. If climate change was so very real; eating meat would be outlawed (all the clearcutting and animal factory farms give off more greenhouse gases then all of the factories and all of the vehicles on the earth combined (surprised?). Anyway, for instance, the warming of the oceans are blamed on the coral bleaching that is destroying our reefs around the world. This is a natural process that happens to corral all the time but the thing that is actually killing them is the pollution created by us. All the reefs are estimated to be saturated/covered with plastics measuring an average of 5cm long with the coral harvesting, ocean pollution, and bad fishing practices adding to the problem. Corral is a live animal and can't breathe when covered in plastic that 'we' put in the ocean:  it's such a shame that we don't seem to care anymore.\n\nWe have gotten away from the average person recycling and don't dry your clothes in a dryer and don't buy anything in plastic; covering the whole realm up to cleaning up environmental sprays etc, etc... The garbage of the world is created by us and here we are embracing climate change which has nothing to do with how we are destroying this planet. The climate changes, that's it. You see, the globalist elite cannot make money with just cleaning up the planet: there's no money in it. But with man-made climate change, they can force mass migration, build electric cars and plants when fusion energy would have been so cheap and so convenient. So the global elite makes up these fantastical claims, that have taken us away from cleaning up our oceans, and our lands; to cringe in fear at nature.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Rap", "channel": "UCGLa9fUGWpEIRfFU4p3Y1Uw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRE-rqGUNyHRNasc5VdpZdzRvfGlwdz2syvxuTKNA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Therefore this video is all rubbish, apart from the old Revelle and Arrhienus thesis there is neither proof nor fact for CO2 being the main culprit. The models are continuously adjusted to follow the reality and predict nothing. Water, clouds and solar cycles are not considered in the models. The ice core data show that the CO2 lags the temperature.  On the NASA website they cite the IPCC report as proof and IPCC cites NASA as proof. In the IPCC references there is also no other relevant proof for the CO2 thesis. The temperature data only comes from two US government agency sources (NASA and NOAA) so they report as required. The data are modified each year to 'adjust' for biases. Unbiased data do not show anywhere near the warming and the manmade component is most likely minimal but exists. Supposedly 15 degrees is the optimal average temperature (which is nonsense in itself) and we are at 14.8. Worldwide FIVE BILLION dollars are paid to climate change researchers EACH YEAR by governments. Not any oil interests who anyway couldn't care less about this as it just raised the price of their product. The inventor of the statistical hokey stick joke Michael Mann gets paid millions from the EPA. Talk about scientists being paid off. Even the Arctic and Antarctic icepacks are today in the official sources within the statistical error for the average if the last 30 years. According to Al Gore the Arctic should be gone by now and all polar bears dead. We have a five fold increase in polar bears to 25000 in the last 20 years because they restricted the hunting. How much more stupid stuff can anyone believe. Finally, I am all for reducing emissions and cleaning up our air as we have done in Europe in the last 30 years where pollution in large cities dropped 70%. If anyone would REALLY believe that CO2 is the problem then the only real solution would be nuclear energy which could be up and running in a decade. Why not ? Because everyone knows it is not a real problem. Any other idea especially renewables are just nonsense. It is all about taxing the wealthy countries and distributing the money to others. The UN wants a $100 BILLION from the US alone EACH year. Now that is the only reason for the climate change scare! The UN and IPCC admits they won't change anything but they still want the money.

The\nplanet has been warming for the last 100 years because we have been in a solar\nmaximum for the last 100 years, since the last solar minimum called\nthe Centennial Minimum which ended at solar cycle 14. The last seven solar\ncycles have been especially high in amplitude with average amplitude of 200.05\nresulting in an even more rapid warming of the planet. But the Grand Solar\nMaximum ended with solar cycle 23; solar cycle 24 started in 2009\nwith an extremely low and long minima, two very low peaks (2012 and 2014),\nand since has nose-dived back to minima levels. Cycle 24 will\nbe amplitude 116.4, the lowest since the aforementioned cycle 14 which\ncame in at amplitude 107.1, and cycle 25 will be at least 30% lower\nputting us back to Dalton Minimum levels. Many expect cycle 26 to be low also\nand if that happens we will experience Maunder Minimum conditions. GCR's will\ncontinue to increase due to the solar minimum and these cause increasing\ncloud nucleation, seismic activity and volcanism. Cloud nucleation and\nvolcanism will increase the albedo effect and the planet will\ncool for the next 20-50 years (or longer if we are unlucky). By then we should\nhave burned up all of the carbon trying not to freeze and still heat our\ngreenhouses so we can feed ourselves. Problem solved, remember: stay calm and\ncarry on. Climate change is real but humans do not need to and should not try\nto avert it, we will fail. What we need to and will have no choice but to do is\nadapt to the changing climate like we always have, if we can.

A number of claims have been made about an increase of hurricanes, tornadoes, and now forest fires due to global warming and yet the records for the past 120 years show a decline for them all. It's the foolish hype people fall for that is amazing. Here is how stupid a number of the people in the world are. The progressives of the world now say solar energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.  If that were the case companies and people would be buying solar panels as fast as they could but they are not. I'm pretty sure communist China doesn't allow the fossil fuel industry to dictate what type of energy to use. It is my understanding China is the largest producer of solar panels and yet they complete a coal fired power plant every 10-14 days.

For example:\r\n\r\n1) CO2 is more abundant in the atmosphere.\r\n2) Bacteria break down much of the methane to form CO2. \r\n3) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than methane, since methane readily reacts with other molecules higher in the atmosphere.\r\n4) Methane levels, and methane's impact energy balance, have begun leveling off, while CO2 levels and impact continue to increase.\r\n5) Methane ends up being responsible for a minority of the anthropogenic impact on energy balance, with CO2 making up the majority. \r\n\r\n\r\nI cite some scientific evidence for each of these points right before figure 4 in section 2.3 of:\r\n\r\n\"+Myth: Attributing Warming to CO2 Involves the Fallaciously Inferring Causation from a Mere Correlation\"\r\nhttp://blamethenoctambulantjoycean.blogspot.ca/2018/04/myth-attributing-warming-to-co2.html\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso see:\r\n\r\n\"Methane is the second most abundant GHG after carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for 14 percent of global emissions.

My comment could have been better focused had I included that it is more likely that American Government and sponsored Special Interest organizations research statistics often ignore Methane impact on global climate change. Here is a quote from: onegreenplanet.org\n\n\"Focusing on carbon emissions is only half the battle – or 74 percent of total emissions to be exact – but, focusing on the percentage of total emissions is extremely misleading because it ignores global warming potential altogether.\n\nWe’ve seen that methane, which accounts for only 14 percent of emissions worldwide, traps up to 100 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 5-year period. This means that even though carbon dioxide molecules outnumber methane 5 to 1, this comparatively smaller amount of methane is still 19 times greater a problem for climate change over a 5 year period, and 4 times greater over a 100 year period.\n\nTo put it another way, any methane molecule released today is 100 times more heat-trapping than a molecule of carbon dioxide, or potentially even higher according to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\nWith the UN establishing various tipping points for irreversible climate change damage on the horizon, it’s time that methane enters mainstream consideration. And better yet, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that livestock production is responsible for 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, while other organizations like the Worldwatch Institute have estimated it could be as much as 51 percent – it’s time that we look beyond our gas tanks and on to our plates.\"", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "1dir", "channel": "UCBr_J-5lIUU7wHoGqGeZpmg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTJjP4A6ofswQmcMOEyDbLZ-ysLI2AWHSzWGfUqiQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Which is why government funding is a must if it's going to happen. So we could realisticly cut down 25% of co2 coming from man made sources.

But many of the predictions of doom were SO overblown that the idea totally lost credibility with me.  I read one article that said the US and Canada would be like the tropics by 2020 and poison ivy would have leaves that were 10 inches across.  I don't think any of that is going to happen in the next two years.  I read that Florida would soon be underwater.  Also not happening. \n\nSo, I stopped believing and thought it was all nonsense. But I still believed humans should use renewable energy and recycle and use less energy.  Doing better for the Earth is always a good idea, whether Global Warming was real or not.\n\nNow, I do believe in Climate Change.  I believe humans are contributing to it.  I believe we need to change.  I don't believe all the overblown doom...\"it's the biggest threat ever\" sort of stuff...nah.

{"cid": "UgzTR_2iqsGfn4RHWh14AaABAg", "text": "So, did you really think that no one would actually fact check your evidence? And, just remember, you asked what we thought, so here's my critique.\nI stopped checking your work half-way through item 10. I found that I had already taken up too much of my own time and too much space with the writing of what I had checked to that point, so I gave up on the rest. I just don't think that I should have to spend more hours fixing your work.  \nIn response to your preamble, I'd like to say that what scientists do or do not agree on or believe should be of little consequence anymore than when politicians want to disagree with facts. Most scientists of their day didn't believed Galileo, Pastuer, or Alfred Wegener. What science can PROVE, IS important.\nPsychological statements like, \"The climate ship has left the dock,\" inferring that those who disagree are left behind those who are so much more enlightened is, to be frank, insulting. You will get no one to listen to your arguments except those who have already been indoctrinated. You change nothing, nor change anyone's mind using this technique. Maybe I should re-phase that to no will change their mind to your way.  \nUsing words like 'could happen' or 'might happen' throughout your presentation does not give me a clear sense of your absolute knowledge of the science. Nor does not predicting larger hurricanes beforehand, but adding them after-the-fact to your repertoire of justifications.  \nItem 3. Since CO2 levels have only been measured since 1958, how does the WMO know what levels were before 1790? It's a SWAG (scientific wild a$$ guess). The fine print on page 2 admits that they are making an assumption. And we all know what ASS-U-ME means, right? This is not the science fact that you promised. Item 6-same problem.  \nItem 7- CO2 levels haven't been this high (>400 ppm) since before humans existed. And your point is.....? I could say that it hasn't been this dark since last night. What does my statement prove? The bottom line is that there was a time that CO2 levels were this high and human intervention was definitely not to blame. It's been 70-80 times that amount of time since that last real dinos roamed the earth. One million years is nothing, when compared to the life of this planet.  I could easily deduce that the cycle for this higher concentration is 1 million years and that this is normal. Yes, I know that this is most likely not true. I recognize the human hand of destruction to our environment. But, I also don't recognize how your statement is an absolute proof in yours or anyone's theory. You've basically stated that there are times that CO2 is high and humans had nothing to do with it.\nItem 10- You show that, worldwide, all volcanoes are only responsible for 0.2 gigatons, or 200 megatons (million tons) of CO2. But, the same source that you, yourself used clearly states that just one volcano, Mt. Pinatubo, is thought to have injected more than 250 megatons of gas into the upper atmosphere on A SINGLE DAY. It also states that in an AVERAGE year, volcanoes release between about 180 and 440 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. I'd say 200 was low-balling the estimates since we don't even know what an average year looks like. Yes, we've been measuring CO2 for 70 years. Compare that with the Earths 5 billion year age and the solar and earth tilt cycles that can take millions. We can't have a real average of volcanic output, just another rough SWAG.  \nYou wouldn't normally use two languages to write one argument, so don't use two measuring systems. In 18 you state that ocean levels are rising by 1/10th inch per year. At the end of your video you state that with the current trend, ocean levels will be up 1 Meter by the end of the century. 0.1 inch = 2.5 mm x 100 (years)= 250mm. That's 1/4 of a meter (did you see how I used your trick of cross measurement there?) And with the fact that electric vehicles and alternative energy sources are in their infancy, this means things will get better without the hype. But, still, if you're going to exaggerate your numbers, try to keep your answers the same throughout your argument. And no, I didn't fact check either of these numbers. I just found an inconsistency in your statement.  \nFor the record, I would like to say that I thought I was a believer in climate change. I certainly was more of one before I watched this video. I would love to believe that we humans have the power within our grasp to lower ocean levels, acid levels, and stop mass extinctions, hurricanes or any other natural disasters. But, what I want and what I get are not always the same. I certainly want to believe that our scientists wouldn't collude in emails and texts to make sure that they get their facts correc........the same. I would also like to believe that they are considering all the facts. But, I am beginning to believe that climate scientists are deliberately avoiding some very important points.   \nEven I know about Milankovitch Cycles. I also know that the billions of square kilometers of land that were buried under 3-5 km thick ice sheets, were compressed by all that weight.I know that even today it continues to rise (an estimated 1 km so far) since the ice melted, back to it's normal height. This has led to more water shedding off into the oceans.  \nI know that the drying up of the Great Salt Lake (think Lake Superior emptying into the ocean), the Caspian and Aral Seas, and other trapped inland waters, along with the emptying of the prehistoric aquifers, both under the U.S. and Canada, and the Sahara desert being pumped dry means that these water displacements have to go somewhere and be accounted for. This planet is a closed loop system. No one seems to be taking these facts into account when measuring the height of the rising oceans. How do we stop the Great Salt Lake and others from evaporating? Do we tell the Russians and Africans that they are not allowed fresh water to drink and grow their food? Maybe we should tell North Americans to conserve their dwindling aquifer by not growing corn for ethanol or eating so much? OK, forget that last one. That's actually a good idea.  \nAnd I haven't even gotten into the Gulf of Mexico coastal erosion caused by the US army corps of engineers, or the Gulfs dead zone, or the assumption (note the word assume) that the Sahara is covered in green for thousands of years due only to a minor shift in the Earths tilt in one of those previously described cycles, Possibly every 30-40,000 years. And we have no control over this, either.\nIn conclusion, we non-scientist outsiders don't have a problem believing REAL science. Pythagoras's theorem can be proven again and again. Einstein's theory of relativity can be shown to be accurate the same as Darwin's theory can be. Yet, despite your best selling methods, what few climate control predictions there are appear to be failing almost as badly as Y2K and 2012. One degree rise over decades does not evidence give. Especially if, as one real scientist, with a Nobel prize points out, your data is flawed. And maligning his reputation proves more about who you are than countering his argument.  Also, that rise in temperature can be explained with other facts that are out of our control.\nNow, can we move on to the real science? Watching the ozone layer closing back up because of the direct efforts of scientists and nations working together; this is real science.

{"cid": "UgwZGhUu96CbTiHyJ4F4AaABAg", "text": "I used this video for follow-along notes and a reflection for my science class.  I hope this helps someone looking for content.\n\nClimate Science: What You Need To Know (STUDENT VERSION)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjIyms1BX4 \n \nLet’s not beat around the rapidly melting iceberg here: climate change is happening, and we’re causing it. The evidence is overwhelming. \n\nScientists usually reserve this level of agreement for claims like “Earth is a planet” and “air is real” yet here we are, the climate change ship has now left the dock, and lots of people on shore are still debating whether boats can actually float. \n\nBUT, maybe you’re a person who trusts and accepts what climate scientists are telling us, it’s just sometimes it’s hard to explain why. I mean we’ve all been there… \n\n“I mean I care about the environment. I figure with the polar bears and everything we might \nas well try electric cars. What do we have to lose?” \n\nAnd then they go CAPS LOCK SERIOUS saying they have proof that climate change is a hoax \nperpetuated by scientists paid off by the Polar Bear Lobby as part of a plan to install Al Gore as supreme world polar bear emperor. WAKE UP SHEEPLE! \n\nTo keep that from happening, we put together this handy reference. \n\n1. The _____ is the source of warmth on Earth, so thanks for that, Sun. Ice and clouds reflect some of its light away, and the rest is absorbed by land and water and re-emitted as heat. \n\n2. Some heat escapes to space, and some is held in by the atmospheric _______________ effect. \n\n3. The insulating effect of Earth’s greenhouse gases are the reason that life exists as we know it, but human activities have increased the concentration of one of them, carbon dioxide, _____% since the Industrial Revolution. \n\n4. We know the sun’s output has varied during history, but since 1970s, the period when global temperatures increased in the fastest, temperature and solar activity have moved in _______________ directions. \n\n5. If the sun was to blame, it would cook the upper and lower layers of atmosphere together. Instead, we only see warming in the ________ layers, the same place that human greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are piling up. \n\n6. Since 1870, with fossil fuels, cement production, and land use combined, humans have put about 2,000 gigatons of _______ into the atmosphere, that's two million million tons, and about 40% has stayed there. \n\n7. Studying gases trapped in ____  ________ have let us see what Earth’s atmosphere was like in the past. At more than 400 parts per million, today’s CO2 levels are the highest they’ve been for almost a million years. That’s before humans even existed, totally uncharted territory for us. \n\n8. More carbon dioxide in atmosphere means average temperatures across the globe are ______________, and fast. Right now, Earth is warming about ten times faster than at the end of an ice age. \n \nOk, so CO2 is increasing. How do we know it's our fault? \nThe best evidence comes from looking at what isotopes, or different kinds of carbon, are in the atmosphere. \n\n9. Fossil fuels come mainly from old __________. Plants prefer to use the lighter isotope carbon-12 over the heavier carbon-13, so they contain a higher ratio of 12 to 13 than the atmosphere does. When more fossil fuels get burned, the percentage of carbon-12 in the atmosphere should go up, and that's exactly what we see. \n\n10. And it's not because of volcanic activity. Volcanoes only emit about ___% as much CO2 as we do. \n\n11. Normally that CO2 is balanced and exchanged between the atmosphere, plants, and animals, BUT eliminating carbon ______ has released centuries worth (of CO2) in just a few years. \n\n12. Other greenhouse gases are also increasing, like _________ from farm animals and natural gas processing, or nitrous oxide from fertilizers. \n \n13. If we run simulations just using natural causes of climate change, they predict ___ change, or even cooling in 20th century and that is not what’s happening. \n\n14. It's still gonna get cold in some places, but in 2000s there were twice as many record highs as record lows. Each of the past three decades has been __________ than any other decade since we started measuring in 1850. \n\n15. Since 1900, actual temperatures around the world increased almost a full degree, and most of that has happened since the ________'s. \n\n16. Looking at data from tree rings and ice cores, the past 30 years is probably the warmest \nin eight centuries. Of course, not every place on Earth warms equally. \n\n17. Oceans cover more than 70% of Earth, and they absorb more than _____% of the heat added to the planet. Naturally, that’s where we see most extreme changes. \n\n18. Around the world, oceans are rising a tenth of inch per year, and they’re up _ inches since 1901. \n\n19. This is because water expands as it warms; \n\n20. and when ice sheets and glaciers melt in Greenland and Antarctica, water that’s normally on frozen land gets put in the ocean. \n\n21. The oceans are Earth's largest carbon sink. As more CO2 enters atmosphere, more of it dissolves in the ocean, which makes the water more __________. \n\n22. This doesn’t mean that the oceans will be made of acid, but animals with calcium shells are super-sensitive to pH. We’re on course for the oceans to hit pH 7.8 in 100 years, which could wipe out one-third of species in the ocean. \n\n23. We also know that levels of summer sea ice in the Arctic have decreased ____% since 1978, they might be the lowest levels in 1400 years. \n\n24. That white sea ice usually __________ the sun’s energy back into atmosphere (albedo effect), BUT the dark ocean is soaking it up like a black shirt on a sunny day, which feeds the cycle forward. \n\nIf CO2 emissions continue on their current trends, Earth is on course to be 2.5-5 degrees °C (4.7-8.6 °F)\nwarmer, and the oceans could be up to a meter higher, by the end of this century.\n\nIs that a big deal? Yeah! It's the biggest deal. This is by far the greatest issue facing our species. The last time the Earth averaged a few degrees colder, most of North America was covered in a mile-thick sheet of ice. That many degrees warmer? We're gonna have a bad time. \n\nSo now you're armed with the facts. Why we know climate change is happening, and why we’re causing it. Please, share this information with the people you know, and let me know: \n\nDid it change any minds? Did it change your mind? I mean, are facts enough? If not, then why do so many people continue to NOT believe in climate science? We'll answer that question in our next video. \nStay curious. \n~ END\n\nReflection Questions (Please answer on a separate sheet of paper and turn it in.):\n1. If you already accepted Climate Change, how did this video help you understand it better?  If you did not accept the science of Climate Change, did this video change your mind? Why or Why Not?\n\n2. What is a question about Climate Change you still have (list at least one)?\n\n3. How high may the oceans get by the end of this century if CO2 emissions follow the current trend AND how may that affect coastal communities?\n\n4. By burning Fossil Fuels, what percent of Carbon Dioxide have we added to the atmosphere AND how does that upset the natural Carbon Cycle? \n\n5. Explain how the above disruption of the Carbon Cycle leads to the warming of earth’s temperatures AND where do we see the most warming (land, atmosphere, oceans)?", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Mr Iacovino", "channel": "UCqw6jUnFLoakhhM3SbEITFw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR71J1RkRl_Z8tMD6g-mkIx5kSj_2efESxXkmh6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Swedish education is very progressive whereas in the US it is compromised by pressure groups trying to mould education to their world view. \nThe Swedes (and Scandinavians in general), by and large, are quite collectivist in their outlook. They generally subscribe to the idea that everyone is better off when we work for collective gains. This is why Scandinavians are far more relaxed about paying high taxes than others: They are confident that well-invested taxes provide exponential results. Americans are far more individualistic. They don't take kindly to being told what to do or how to think, and the White House hates the idea of being subjugated to international bodies such as the UN, the ICC or the IPCC. Since America is so corrupt, they have no faith in their governments disbursing tax receipts constructively. Big industry, in particular big pharma, the fossil fuel industry and the military industrial cartel, are the big winners from US tax spending.  \nYou could also add that the very religious Americans are kinda gullible and prone to latching onto any viewpoints that accord with their own world view, whereas the more pragmatic Swedes place their faith in scientists.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Jonnie Park", "channel": "UCNbqDbC3eFJ0uvaq8LEZuQw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQXdq1K05sXK-S4yKHfJvHCbUv4utEfG1dRjo2aW5k=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz2tNXH_FaakoPbEqt4AaABAg", "text": "There's definitely something weird about the climate where I live (Utah) in the last decade or so...it seems BOTH extreme seasons have been getting, well, more extreme.  And closer together!  I kid you not, two weeks ago we had an end-of-summer wildfire so close to my town we had trouble with coughing and stinging eyes for a week...and as I write this, it's been raining all night and _there is frost vapor on my window_.\n\nIT'S NOT EVEN OCTOBER YET!\nI mean, sure, this doesn't mean that every day from now on is just gonna get colder and colder, but c'mon, frost on the windows only a WEEK after the last SUMMER wildfire finally got under control?  Even in a quickly-changing-weather biome like a desert (we had an Arizona-like summer this year, too) or mountain (\"Greatest Snow on Earth!\"--don't look at me like that.  It's a phrase on our license plates) doesn't normally change THAT fast.\n\nSummer this year contained like two weeks in a row where the high of the day didn't fall below 100 (Fahrenheit, I'm an American and this is about a place in America--I'm not saying it was literally BOILING! :P) and yet I feel fairly certain that winter this year will do similarly as it did last year, after a just-as-hot summer:  contain entire weeks where the high of the day doesn't break into two digits.  (For you metric users: That's DEFINITELY colder than 0 C.)  It seems odd (and kinda unfair) to have both hot summers AND cold winters; you'd think that the warmer summers would mean milder winters or the colder winters would mean cooler summers.  NOPE! \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I have empirical evidence, gathered from my own real-life experience of living in the same place for decades, that SOMEthing funky is going on with the weather.  And if it's not us?

You think solar and wind are cheap? Solar is only cheap because it's subsidized  by enormous amounts of Tax dollars, which means the Taxpayer ends up paying more in the long-term. Also, solar panels are complicated to manufacture, and require extremely dangerous chemicals like Hydrogen Sulfide, which destroys bone. Or Cadmium, which has problems of it's own. AND, they wear out from sun-exposure.\nSecondly, Wind turbines are also expensive to manufacture, and in California, they've had a bad history of wearing out bearings and catching fire.\nLastly, most solar and wind is manufactured in China, which has looser Regulations on pollution, so they GET all/most of the money. Do we WANT to send more money to China?\n\nAlternatively, there are arguments that say CO2 is only a small part, about 4%, of the greenhouse gases that hold the Sun's warmth, and thus cause Global Warming. Water vapor is 95%. \nNo one I know knows how to control water vapor, which is mostly from sea-water evaporation. It's why the Paris Accord only promised to LIMIT the PROJECTED temp rise of 3 to 7 degrees, by .05 degrees! And cost US 2 Trillion dollars! Such a DEAL!\n\nThat said....why not approach the problem from a Technical viewpoint? Like, say, setting up a Space Umbrella to shield the Earth from 5% of sunlight?

The earth did warm from 1978 to 1988, but it also cooled from the 1939 until 1977 and guess what back then they were blaming human activity for the cooling.  But, in all actuallity humans have little to no effect on global temperatures, all you have to do is study the temperatures of the Pacific Ocean to understand why the climate changes.  When the eastern part of the ocean is warmer than the western part, like it was from the early 1900s to 1938 and from 1978 to 1998, the earth warms.  When it is the other way around, like it was from 1939 to 1977 and from 1998 until present, you get cooling.  Also, the 1930s was the warmest decade on record.  CO2 may be at the highest it has been since humans have been on the planet, but it is nowhere near the highest it has ever been. about 570 million years ago it was 20 times higher than it was today.  Then there is also the fact that the average temperature of earth has varied from 12 degrees celcius to 22 degrees celcius at all levels of CO2.

{"cid": "UgirvOA6styktXgCoAEC", "text": "Several of his \"facts\" are completely wrong.\n\n#1.  Yes, the sun is the source of the majority of Earth's \"warmth\" - thanks for that, captain obvious.\n\n#2.  Yes, the Greenhouse Effect does trap some of the heat that would otherwise be re-emitted into space.  But it is interesting that he never actually explains how much...   Not so bad in #2 but very bad for #3 as you'll see.  It is also incorrect to say that the Sun's output hasn't changes.   The thermal output hasn't changed much - at least not in a way that would explain the temperature increase but its magnetic output has increased.   This causes a reduction in cloud creation.  Fewer clouds means warming.  In fact, according to scientists like Svensmark (see a documentary on him called the \"Cloud Mystery\" for more information).  You'll see that changes is the Sun's magnetic output better explain the warming we've seen than CO2.\n\n#3 .  There is where the wheels really begin to come off this ridiculous wagon.  Saying that CO2 has increased 40% since the Industrial Revolution sounds like a lot.  However, a more honest way to describe the increase would be from ~280 parts per million by volume to about 400 ppmv.   Again, that sounds like a lot expressed as a percentage increase or even as the raw increase of ~120ppmv but what is it as a percentage of the whole?  100ppmv is another way of saying 0.01%.  Also, prior to the 1900s (or 1960s, depending on who you ask) humans didn't increase CO2 enough to affect climate in any way.  Even though the Industrial Revolution began in the 1700s, it is important to remember that it was a very localized phenomenon for most of that time.  Only in the 1900s did it become a global event.  So how do you explain the warming that happened prior to the 1900s?\n\n#4.  This is totally wrong.   The temperatures didn't \"increase the fastest\" in the 1970s and neither did CO2 concentration.  Part of the problem with the hypothesis that anthropogenic CO2 has driven the warming since the end of the Little Ice Age is that the correlation between CO2 levels and temperature from the 1700s to present is so poor.  Sometimes they rise at the same time, sometimes they go in opposite direction.   Look at the cooling period in the mid 20th century where, despite record increases in CO2, the average global temperature actually fell - to the point that, in the 1970s, scientists were predicting a possible ice-age.\n\n#5.  He's actually shooting himself in the foot here.  If CO2 were the primary driver, we'd see warming in the troposphere that we're simply not seeing.  The warming we are seeing is not consistent with being driven primarily by CO2.\n\n#6...  Ok, that's it.  I'm done with this nonsense.

Mann also admits that global warming has continued:\n\n\"The rate at which the earth’s temperature has been rising eased slightly in the past decade, but temperature is still increasing; calling the slowdown a “pause” is false.\"\nhttp://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/articles/articles/MannSciAmApr14.pdf\n\n\"Making sense of the early-2000s warming slowdown\n[...]\nWe do not believe that warming has ceased [...]\nA point of agreement we have with Lewandowsky et al. 26 concerns the unfortunate way in which the recent changes have been framed in terms of GMST having “'stalled', 'stopped', 'paused', or entered a 'hiatus'”. Just exactly how such changes should be referred to is open to debate. Possible choices include 'reduced rate of warming', 'decadal fluctuation' or 'temporary slowdown' — all try to convey the primary mechanism involved, which in the recent example is likely to be internal decadal variability.\"\nhttps://courses.eas.ualberta.ca/eas570/warming_slowdown.pdf\n\n\n\n\"I am curious why it is that many predictions made by scientists including the \"hockey stick\" Al Gore Model don't appear to be accurate today.\"\n\nSee the following Youtube video:\n\"23 -- Medieval Warm Period -- fact vs. fiction\"\n\nIn that video (from about 2:10), potholer54 discussed the hockey stick pattern, in which recent global warming occurs at a much faster rate than warming during the MWP [medieval warm period]. potholer54 also discusses the multiple lines of research supporting this hockey stick pattern. And figure 4 of the following paper again confirms the hockey stick pattern by comparing different temperature constructions: \n\"Continental-scale temperature variability during the last two millennia\"\n\nThe hockey stick pattern also shows up in the following papers:\n\"Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age and 20th century temperature variability from Chesapeake Bay\"\n\"Inter-hemispheric temperature variability over the past millennium\"\n\nThe following paper addresses, and rebuts, criticism of the hockey stick pattern:\n\"Robustness of the Mann, Bradley, Hughes reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures: Examination of criticisms based on the nature and processing of proxy climate evidence\"\n\nMann even showed the same hockey stick pattern without the tree ring proxies that many people had objected to:\n\"Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia\"\n\nAlso, the following paper compares recent warming to Northern Hemisphere temperatures back to 1000AD. This data seems to suggest modern warming stronger than that seen in the medieval periods displayed (see figure 2):\n\"Ensemble reconstruction constraints on the global carbon cycle sensitivity to climate\"\n\nFurthermore, see the following for an alternative account, where recent modern temperatures were warmer than the vast majority of the Holocene, reversing a long-term cooling trend:\n\"A Reconstruction of Regional and Global Temperature for the Past 11,300 Years\"\n\nFor further discussion of this at a laymen's level, see:\nhttps://www.skepticalscience.com/broken-hockey-stick.htm\n\n\n\n\"Please, don't assume that everyone who is skeptical of climate change is \"denying the facts\" or is paid off by big oil companies.\"\n\nSkepticism is not denialism; we shouldn't conflate the two.

Thats very convenient, because you don't mention the fact that it hasnt been the hottest in 2000 years, when it was FAR warmer than today, before that we had multiple climates, including the ice age, and between that peak the temperatures have came down to way less than today (The Little Ice Age that drove the vikings out of Greenland) and then back up until today.

Another solar metric, TSI, thats how strongly it shines,  is also up in the last century, and has stayed up.\"\n\nThe sun does not account for recent global warming (since about the 1970s).\n\nHere's NASA dumbing it down for you:\n\n\"Is the sun causing global warming?\nNo. The sun can influence the Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards.\nOne of the “smoking guns” that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun’s energy reaching Earth.\nA second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting “hotter.”\"\nhttp://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?\n\n\nAnd here are some scientific papers showing that the sun did not cause most of the recent global warming:\n\n\"Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate\"\n\"Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century\"\n\"Evidence of recent causal decoupling between solar radiation and global temperature\"\n\"Solar trends and global warming\"\n\"Small influence of solar variability on climate over the past millennium\"\n\"Quantifying the role of solar radiative forcing over the 20th century\"\n\"Unusual activity of the Sun during recent decades compared to the previous 11,000 years\"\n\"Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850\"\n\"Can solar variability explain global warming since 1970?\" \n\n\n\n\"oceans absorb 90% of the heat added to the climate.  This is completely bogus.\"\n\nNope:\n\n\"Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence).[...] On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010.\"\nhttp://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf\n\n\n\n\"Loss of arctic  sea ice is a net NEGATIVE feedback for two reasons\"\n\nNope. The melting ice decreases Earth's albedo, promoting warming. This positive feedback is discussed in sources such as:\n\n\"Observational determination of albedo decrease caused by vanishing Arctic sea ice\"\n\"Estimating the global radiative impact of the sea ice–albedo feedback in the Arctic\"\n\"The central role of diminishing sea ice in recent Arctic\ntemperature amplification\"\n\n\n\n\"In summary, we do know it is getting warmer, we do know we are contributing to that, but the effect is small and therefore entirely beneficial\"\n\nNope. Numerous scientists know the following (hence the scientific consensus these):\n\nA1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century.\nA2) Humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of this recent warming.\nA3) Most of the recent (or near future) climate change is (or will be) caused by humans.\nA4) Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity.\n\nThe consensus on A1 and A2 is discussed in:\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\nThe consensus on A3 and A4 is discussed in:\nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/\n\"The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016\"\n\n\nThe following sources provide scientific evidence on A1 and A2 (there are at least 50 scientific papers providing evidence on A2):\n\n\"Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century\"\n\"Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations\"\n\"Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance\"\n\"Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979–2005\"\n\"Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset\"\n\"A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming\"\n\"Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature\"\n\"Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change\"\n\"Evidence for external forcing on 20th-century climate from combined ocean-atmosphere warming patterns\"\n\"Observed 21st century temperatures further constrain likely rates of future warming\"\n\n\nAnd the reason for the consensus on A4, is that there's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause):\n- increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality)\n- increased drought intensity\n- economic losses from sea level rise\n- increased hurricane intensity\n- ocean acidification (which results in things such as loss of marine crops and marine food)\n- reduced crop yields\nand so on.\n\nHere's some research on this, to get you started:\n\n\"A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation\"\n\"Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation\"\n\"Ocean Acidification: The Other CO2 Problem\"\n\"Nutrition and income from molluscs today imply vulnerability to ocean acidification tomorrow\"\n\"Economic impacts of climate change in Europe: sea-level rise\"\n\"Economic losses from US hurricanes consistent with an influence from climate change\"\n\"Tropical cyclones and climate change\"\n\"Anthropogenic warming has increased drought risk in California\"\n\"Contribution of anthropogenic warming to California drought during 2012–2014\"\n\"Increasing drought under global warming in observations and models\"\n\"Global warming and changes in drought\"\n\"Climate warming will not decrease winter mortality\"\n\"Winter season mortality: will climate warming bring benefits?\"\n\"Winter mortality in a warming climate: a reassessment\"\n\"Heat-Related Mortality and Adaptation to Heat in the United States\"\n\"Projecting Future Heat-Related Mortality under Climate Change Scenarios: A Systematic Review\"\n\"Climate change effects on human health: projections of temperature-related mortality for the UK during the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s\"\n\"Comparative Assessment of the Effects of Climate Change on Heat and Cold-Related Mortality in the United Kingdom and Australia\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Midlevel clouds provide a positive net cloud feedback that is a combination of a positive SW feedback partially canceled by a negative feedback in the longwave (LW). High clouds have only a small impact on the net cloud feedback because of a close cancellation between large LW and SW cloud feedbacks.\"\n\n\"A net decrease in the Earth’s cloud, aerosol, and surface 340 nm reflectivity during the past 33 yr (1979–2011)\n[...]\nThe amount of the longwave offset plus changes in atmospheric absorption determine whether the cloud plus aerosol change represents a net positive or negative feedback.

Anthropogenic greenhouse gases did. Do your homework, denialist.\n\n\nClimate scientists know that the sun did not cause the recent global warming, while anthropogenic greenhouse gases did cause the recent warming.\n\nHere's NASA dumbing it down for you:\n\n\"Is the sun causing global warming?\nNo. The sun can influence the Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards.\nOne of the “smoking guns” that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun’s energy reaching Earth.\nA second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting “hotter.”\"\nhttp://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?\n\n\"But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the sun:\n- Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased slightly.\n- If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.\n- Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.\"\nhttp://climate.nasa.gov/causes/\n\n\nAnd here are some scientific papers showing that the sun did not cause most of the recent global warming:\n\n\"Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century\"\n\"Evidence of recent causal decoupling between solar radiation and global temperature\"\n\"Solar trends and global warming\"\n\"Small influence of solar variability on climate over the past millennium\"\n\"Quantifying the role of solar radiative forcing over the 20th century\"\n\"Unusual activity of the Sun during recent decades compared to the previous 11,000 years\"\n\"Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850\"\n\"Can solar variability explain global warming since 1970?\"\n\n\nThough cosmic rays likely influenced climate in the past, cosmic rays did not cause the recent global warming period, i.e. the global warming since the mid-20th century. This is discussed in scientific sources you're ignorant of, such as:\n\n\"Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate\"\n\"Dynamical evidence for causality between galactic cosmic rays and interannual variation in global temperature\"\n\"Reply to Luo et al.: Robustness of causal effects of galactic cosmic rays on interannual variation in global temperature\"\n\"Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements\"\n\n\n\n\"As for what you say, the theory that WV increase at 7%/K is just a theory, and has not actually happened.  If you look at all data sets there has been no SH increase associated with the recent warming.\"\n\nBertie Blue and I already corrected your fabrications on this long ago. Stop repeating your distortions. Try to address Bertie Blue's point in an intellectually honest manner:\n\n\"The only claims for 7% have nothing to do with specific humidity.\"\n\"Link 4 (Google book): This says that the SATURATION VAPOUR PRESSURE increases at a rate of 7% per Kelvin, NOT the specific humidity. This is NOT a claim of global warming - it is an experimentally verified fact. If you place water in a sealed container, the vapour pressure in the sealed space above the water will rise at 7% per Kelvin. It is the MAXIMUM vapour pressure - the actual vapour pressure will only equal that when the relative humidity is 100%. The saturation vapour pressure is used to calculate the RELATIVE humidity. It is the WATER HOLDING CAPACITY which increases at 7% per Kelvin, NOT the actual quantity of water in the atmosphere. Yes, if relative humidity were to remain the same under warming, then that would mean specific humidity would also increase by 7%. But the prediction is that relative humidity will DECREASE under warming. The predicted increase for SPECIFIC humidity is 1-3%.\"\n\"So you refuse to learn the difference between \"saturation vapour pressure\" and \"specific humidity\". Trenbath's paper: \" water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1°C warming\" (your 4th link uses the same teminology).\nAs I already explained, water holding capacity is the ability of the atmosphere to hold water vapour, NOT the amount of water vapour it actually holds. As average relative humidity FALLS (as predicted), the actual quantity of water vapour in the air will rise by LESS than 7%.\" \n\n\nAnyway, the expected changes in water vapor occurred. AGW began predominantly in the mid-to-late 1970s, and was preceded by global cooling from the 1940s to the 1970s. Scientists observed the expected increase in atmospheric moisture over the relevant time-frame of 1980 - 2010, when the warming is most pronounced:\n\n\"Increasing evidence from observations and climate models indicates that anthropogenic activity is increasing atmospheric moisture (Boucher et al. 2004; Willett et al. 2007; Santer et al. 2007; Min et al. 2008).\n[...]\nMost studies of global atmospheric moisture indicate that recent warming is associated with an increase in specific humidity and little change in relative humidity (Dai 2006; Trenberth et al. 2007; Willett et al. 2008). A more recent analysis suggests that reductions in relative humidity have occurred because of a lack of increase in oceanic moisture being supplied to warming land surfaces (Simmons et al. 2010).\n[...]\nHourly temperatures in the United States have warmed since 1930, with much of this warming occurring since 1980. [...] There have been no long-term changes in dewpoint temperatures or specific humidity but rather there has been a decreasing (1947–79) and then an increasing (1980–2010) trend in both variables.\"\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-035.1\n\n\n\n\"And no, clouds are not  a net +ve feedback,  you are wrong\"\n\nStop being in denialist of the evidence. Clouds can act as positive feedback or negative feddback, though on the whole they are a net positive feedback:\n\n\"Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record\n[...]\nOur results suggest that radiative forcing by a combination of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and volcanic aerosol has produced observed cloud changes during the past several decades that exert positive feedbacks on the climate system.\"\n\n\"A net decrease in the Earth’s cloud, aerosol, and surface 340 nm reflectivity during the past 33 yr (1979–2011)\n[...]\nThe amount of the longwave offset plus changes in atmospheric absorption determine whether the cloud plus aerosol change represents a net positive or negative feedback.

It kinda goes over it but mostly it just assumes it's bc of CO2. But the problem I have is when people argue against it they say that we assume that the co2 is the significant reason for climate change.\"\n\nIt's a well-evidenced fact that humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of the global warming that occurred since the mid-20th century. Arguing about this point, is like arguing over whether HIV causes AIDS or whether smoking causes cancer.\n\n\nThere are at least 50 scientific papers showing this. These papers use various techniques, including:\n\n- model-based prediction, where those models were tested against previous data, including paleoclimatological data, akin to how one can predict the generate astronomical models that explain the motion of planets/satellites and then use those models to predict the motion of other planets/satellites; the models predict how much warming would result from solar forcing, CO2 release, etc. based on how much warming resulted from these factors in the past\n\n- examining warming patterns in different layers of the atmosphere (since different forcings produce different patterns of atmospheric warming, with greenhouse gases having a particular atmospheric warming pattern).\n\nSo different methods have yielded much the same conclusion. That is a hallmark of good science: consilience of different results on the same, accurate conclusion. That way, the strengths of one methods can compensate for the weaknesses in another method, and you know that your result is not just due to the flaws of one particular methods.\n\nHere are some of the 50+ scientific papers on this:\n\n\"Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century\"\n\"Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations\"\n\"Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance\"\n\"Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979–2005\"\n\"Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset\"\n\"A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming\"\n\"Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature\"\n\"Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change\"\n\"Evidence for external forcing on 20th-century climate from combined ocean-atmosphere warming patterns\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Looks like the simulation is not working right, we are not getting the \"right\" answer, tweak those numbers a bit.\"\n\nIn the 80's they told us (in elementary school, through a program called CARE), that by 2001 we'd all have to wear protective suits to be able to go outside. Also we were supposed to have used up all the oil by 2001 (or maybe it was 2010).  They told us a lot of stuff that wasn't true.  So forgive me for not trusting these people, they have a bad track record that they have NEVER addressed.  Why were they wrong in the 80's, and why are they right now?  The kids who were brainwashed in the 80's are they heading up these climate science research projects?\n\nI don't trust climate scientists because they are living in an echo chamber where the only acceptable answer to any question is the popular one.

Arguing about this point, is like arguing over whether HIV causes AIDS or whether smoking causes cancer.\n\nThere are at least 50 scientific papers showing this. These papers use various techniques, including:\n\n- model-based prediction, where those models were tested against previous data, including paleoclimatological data, akin to how one can predict the generate astronomical models that explain the motion of planets/satellites and then use those models to predict the motion of other planets/satellites; the models predict how much warming would result from solar forcing, CO2 release, etc. based on how much warming resulted from these factors in the past\n\n- examining warming patterns in different layers of the atmosphere (since different forcings produce different patterns of atmospheric warming, with greenhouse gases having a particular atmospheric warming pattern).\n\nSo different methods have yielded much the same conclusion. That is a hallmark of good science: consilience of different results on the same, accurate conclusion. That way, the strengths of one methods can compensate for the weaknesses in another method, and you know that your result is not just due to the flaws of one particular methods.\n\nHere are some of the 50+ scientific papers on this:\n\n\"Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century\"\n\"Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations\"\n\"Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance\"\n\"Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979–2005\"\n\"Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset\"\n\"A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming\"\n\"Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature\"\n\"Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change\"\n\"Evidence for external forcing on 20th-century climate from combined ocean-atmosphere warming patterns\"\n\n\n\n\"The only argument is the carbon isotopes argument, could you develope more on that please?\"\n\nThere are quite a number of ways we can confirm that the recent CO2 increase is anthropogenic. For example, we can:\n\n1) use carbon isotope ratios in atmospheric CO2\n2) show that the oceans likely aren't a net releaser of CO2, since the oceans are acidifying (indicative of net CO2 uptake, not net CO2 release) and CO2 levels are increasing in the ocean\n3) measure emissions from other non-anthropogenic sources (such as volcanoes), and see that anthropogenic emissions outweigh those sources\n4) observe the decreased atmospheric O2 levels that one would expect from burning of fossils fuels as a contributor to CO2 emissions\n5) observe the correlation between increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions and increased atmospheric CO2\n6) the radiative forcing and temperature response changed from before to after the industrial revolution, consistent with anthropogenic CO2 emissions resulting in warming (as opposed to it just being non-anthropogenic)\n\nAnd here are some background sources on these points:\n\nPoint 1:\nhttps://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JD017048/full\nhttps://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/viewFile/16286/pdf\n\nPoints 1, 2, 4, and 5:\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.713.6770&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nPoint 2:\nftp://oce.orst.edu/dist/OMEL/Diazo_CO2/Doneyetal2009.pdf\nhttps://eprints.soton.ac.uk/363195/\n\nPoint 3:\nhttp://minsocam.org/MSA/RIM/RiMG075/RiMG075_Ch11.pdf\nhttp://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2007/07_02_15.html\n\nPoint 6:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Theologos_Dergiades/publication/287372610_Long-Run_Changes_in_Radiative_Forcing_and_Surface_Temperature_The_Effect_of_Human_Activity_over_the_Last_Five_Centuries/links/568d515008aead3f42ed982b.pdf\n\n\nSkepticalScience discusses some other lines of evidence as well:\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/anthrocarbon-brief.html", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugj2fJ7V99Tj6HgCoAEC.8ONFW6yvxnP8Pwgg9Z2u_J", "text": "The distinction you are making between denialists and skeptics is way too involved for my money.  I'm just using the term in the common manner.  I'm skeptical.  When I say I'm skeptical, I don't mean \"professionally,\"  I mean I'm not sure I believe the claims of climate science and I have various reasons which keep me from completely buying into the idea.\n\nIf I was going to make a convenient distinction to serve my argument, I would make one between Climate Alarmists and climate scientists.  A climate scientist has to wait for the result of his prediction to empirically confirm his theory.  You don't have that with Climate Alarmists.  Climate Alarmists do not wait for data that confirms their prediction, and they are willing to suppress data  which refutes their prediction.  Climate Alarmism is belief in an unproven prediction that human carbon dioxide emissions will catastrophically alter the Earth's environment.\n\nClimate Alarmists have staked entire reputations on these predictions.  I don't know much about climate science, but I do know a lot about human nature, and scientists are like all other people.  They do not merely make mistakes, they are capable of deluding themselves.  If one's immediate superior is a Climate Alarmist, there are many and diverse sociological motives which will effect the gathering and interpretation of data.\n\nI have a book called Forbidden Archaeology, which documents cases where members of the scientific community have suppressed evidence and destroyed the careers of colleagues who threatened to undermine consensus on subjects on which prominent community members  have built their careers and reputations.  \n\n\"Because the models/simulations are compared to data to make sure they are accurate.\"  \n\nThe models are only accurate to the available experimental data.  The source of experimental data is the actual climate.  There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to runaway global warming would look like.   Most of the data used to compare with the models is the data gathered \"so far.\"  So the predictive reliability of these models is still questionable and could be way off due to yet unknown factor or programing error. \n\nNone of the predictions of these models are empirical.  So when people say 97% of Climate Scientists agree on global warming, I'd like to know just exactly what they are agreeing about.  Do they all agree with the dire and unconfirmed predictions of these models?  \n\nOne of the most important aspects of science is experimentation.  Experiments have to be repeatable so that results can be confirmed.  We don't properly have that with climate science.  All we have is a simulation which keeps getting run, over and over, and the scientific nature of that simulated reality is perfectly reasonable to doubt.  \n\nThe climate is a very big thing to study,  I'm not convinced that we have come so far that  we know all the factors involved and that our simulations are replicating reality.  For instance, in chemistry, some reactions have limitations in a given environment.  Does the effect plateau?  And the degree and nature of the change caused by rising CO2 levels is a question for which we do not have empirical answers. \n\nThe point of saying that is not to say, \"THEREFORE!  Climate Change is a Hoax!\"  I'm not saying that.   When I hear appeals to authority and to consensus and see great social pressure being used to push a point,  I instinctively dig in my heels.  That's just my nature. I frequently play devil's advocate to myself in my own head and try on different ideas.  Just going with the crowd is not in my DNA. \n\nI understand we can't afford to run the experiment of climate change.  In fact, the point of climate alarmism is to force human society to change, using the power of the state, in order to avoid climate change, is it not?  \n\nSo, there are some intense pressures here.  If the Climate Alarmists fail to change human activity, and little or no climate change occurs, then the Climate Scientists and Alarmists alike are going to seem more and more like chicken little and will fall into disrepute.  \n\nOn the other hand, if Climate Alarmists succeed in changing government policy, and little or no climate change occurs, they will have succeeded in seizing great power and influence for themselves \nwithout having had to prove that any of there predictions were experimentally valid.  \n\nIf they are right, and catastrophic climate change does occur, that is a price no one wants to pay.  Even so, if true, the process is not likely to be reversed due to social forces.  I recall learning that the last time a single species came to dominate the world it led to a mass extinction (I do not recall if the two were related).  Mass extinctions are part of life and death on planet earth.  \n\nI don't wish to become extinct or to watch the natural world become less rich. But the destruction of one epoch gives rise to another.  According to the fossil and geological records, mass extinctions open up new opportunities for new life forms.  If the former inhabitants of the earth had never died off, we never would have come to be.  We cling to the earth as it currently exists, but it is going to change, whether because of our activity, or because of external factors.  Gradually, or suddenly, it will change and various life forms will perish, and new life will emerge, or perhaps, finally, death will reign. That's also a strong consensus opinion out there.\n\nOK, that is a very fatalistic view. So, I want to ask, what if there is only marginal climate change?  What if the changes in the climate are not catastrophic, but just generally \"bad?\"  And by \"bad\" I mean that the changes cause smaller extinctions and disturbances to the environment.  How small?  How about small enough that people will willingly pay the price? \n\nGlobal warming is a bit of a catch-all phrase.  How much global warming do all these scientists agree on?  Because the amount makes a big difference.  Personally, I think that is what causes Climate Alarmists to make dire predictions instead of conservative ones. Climate Alarmists use fear because they know that if we had to sacrifice all the polar bears, so that every human could live that first-world lifestyle, that we would get a solid worldwide majority who would vote to let the polar bears die, and deal with the regret later.  \n\nThat's what I think drives the fear among climate alarmists.  They need to use the power of the state to force changes on people before those people realize that climate change may involve prices they are willing to pay in order to live with modern conveniences.  Without the fear of catastrophic changes, most humans would be willing to make a devil's bargain to obtain prosperity at the price of environmental degradation.  That is what drives Climate Alarmism.  There is not enough data to justify Climate Alarmism.  \n\nThat is the outcome I actually find reasonable, because in spite of being skeptical about the claims of climate science,   I instinctively feel that having so many people doing so many things is bound to have at least SOME impact.  I just question the dire nature of the predictions.  I feel that the masses are being manipulated towards panic in order to make them agree to societal changes they would not agree to if they believed the coming climate changes were more minor. \n\nI don't mis-remember CARE.  I might have their predictive dates off, but it was coming early this (21st) century.  This was not some rogue teacher, this was (at least) a district wide program, and probably much larger. I remember the information because it came in the form of worksheets that had some very nice artwork and well crafted propaganda.  The information was presented in the form of a letter from the future.  A future student was writing back to the 11 year old me in 1984 to tell me what life was like in 20xx). It was striking and haunting. \n\nWhen I said \"There's one reason I'm skeptical\"  that was not a very well written sentence.  I should have said \"Here's one reason,\"  because I have a number of reasons for being skeptical, none of them very strong, but all joined together they prevent me from believing the claims of climate alarmists.  Some more rational than others, but as I said, all uninformed (in terms of climate science).  General suspicion is one reason I remain skeptical of the claims of climate alarmists.\n\n When I saw, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\"  I was somewhat swayed, and seriously considered what the impact of skyrocketing carbon dioxide might be on the environment.  The exponential growth on Al Gore's chart was so visibly alarming but when I considered the implications I came to believe that whatever the results are, they are inevitable.\n\nIn regards to the echo chamber claim.  The claim (not mine) that 99% (97%?) of climate scientists agree means that they are indeed in an echo chamber. What comes from their mouths is what they hear from their colleagues, and they may be right, but they are living in an echo chamber.  This happens in science all the time.  You really need to study scientists from a sociological point of view.  Science is empirical, scientists are human.  \n\nFantastic claims require fantastic proof.  Fantastic claims offered by people living in echo chambers can be reasonably questioned (especially when the evidence is a computer program they all worked on together).  If they say global warming is an urgent and existential threat to the earth and that 97% of scientists agree on \"climate change\"  (though it is rarely stated HOW MUCH climate change they agree on)  I think it is entirely reasonable to suspect that there are more sociological forces than empirical science at work.\n\nI tried posting this earlier but it wouldn't show up.

Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a straw man used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50).\"\n\n\n\n\"The models are only accurate to the available experimental data\"\n\nNo. For example, take the following paper:\n\"Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record\"\n\nThat paper compares cloud data, to the cloud predictions made by climate models. The climate models were made before this cloud data analysis was done. So the cloud data (presented in the analysis discussed in the paper) had not yet been fed into the models. Instead, the models were made/published, the cloud data was then analyzed, and then the models were compared to the data.\n\nAnother example of this is the IPCC first consensus prediction. It fit the data that followed it did rather well, as discussed in the following paper:\n\"Assessment of the first consensus prediction on climate change\"\n\n\n\n\"So when people say 97% of Climate Scientists agree on global warming, I'd like to know just exactly what they are agreeing about.\"\n\nThere's a scientific consensus that:\n\nA1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century.\nA2) Humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of this recent warming.\nA3) Most of the recent (or near future) climate change is (or will be) caused by humans.\nA4) Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity.\n\nThe following paper documents that consensus on A1 and A2:\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\nFor the consensus on A3 and A4, among AAAS (American Academy for the Advancement of Science) scientists with relevant expertise, there's a 95% consensus that climate change was a serious problem and a 93% consensus that recent warming is mostly caused by humans:\n\n\"Earth Scientists Views on Climate Change\"\nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/\n\nAnd in another survey, ~87% of climate researchers thought that humans caused (or will cause) most of the recent (or near future) climate change, while ~86% of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and a threat to humanity:\n\nFigures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of \"The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016\"\nhttps://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf\n\n\n\n\"None of the predictions of these models are empirical.\"\n\nNonsense, since the models make empirical predictions that can be compared to the empirical data.\n\n\n\n\" I'm not convinced that we have come so far that  we know all the factors involved\"\n\nWe don't need to know all the factors involved in order to know what caused most of the recent warming, just like I don't need to know all the factors involved in a murder to know that the defendant killed the victim.\n\n\n\n\"One of the most important aspects of science is experimentation.

What qualifies as a catastrophe?  This is what I'm talking about.  Out of one side of your mouth you say, I quote, \"~86% of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and a threat to humanity:\" That sounds catastrophic to me. \n\nBy the way, the whole \"Climate Alarmists vs Climate Scientists\" was merely a \"tit for tat\" ad hominem attack on the motives of scientists.  Just as you have essentially been attacking the motives of anyone who dares question their unsupported claim that their observations predict a THREAT to humanity.  You denied the validity of skeptics you don't agree with.  Do you realize how incredibly childish that is?   \"They're deniers, not skeptics!\"  It becomes an essentially sociological argument at that point.  It's a \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. \n\nThe globe has undergone many changes while humans have inhabited it.  These Climate scientists are obviously no anthropologists.  There once was a place called Doggerland, it was swallowed by the sea during a period of global warming, humanity survived.\n\nI made no reference to a Venus situation, but I don't know why that would be ruled out in any case.  As the most resilient of the large mammals, anything that threatens humans threatens most mammals.  Perhaps most chordates.  I really don't know because the threat is unspecified.\n\nStarting at \"a threat to humanity,\" most humans would consider things that can threaten all of humanity with.... extinction?  Sunburns?  What is the threat?  That's why you people come off as preachy zealots.  Amorphous threats are the tools of despots. \n\nCloud predictions?  A model that predicts clouds is not a model that predicts that clouds are going to threaten humanity.  How are the clouds going to kill us?  Are the models predicting consecutive months or years of total cloud cover?  That would indeed be a threat.\n\nA predictive model has to be relevant to the prediction you are making.  We are talking about a humanity threatening change in the earth's climate.  Exactly which model predicts that, and exactly what data goes into that.\n\nI reassert that any models that predict \"a threat to humanity\" are not empirical, and probably do not exist.  What is happening is that scientists are looking at models that tell them the earth is warming and they make the judgment THEMSELVES that it is a threat to humanity.  And what is much more likely is that the global temperature change is a threat to specialized animals in certain cold environments.\n\nHere is something for you to think about.  If the industrial revolution never happened.  And humanity was limited to half a billion people living a sustainable lifestyle.  Can you guarantee the climate would never change?  Of course not.  \n\nYou made a bad analogy here \"We don't need to know all the factors involved in order to know what caused most of the recent warming, just like I don't need to know all the factors involved in a murder to know that the defendant killed the victim.\"\n\nThat is a bad analogy.  We are not trying to solve a murder, we are trying to predict the future.  Those two operations are NOT analogous.  Predictive models which lack critical elements will give bad predictions.  That is something I should not have to argue.   \n\nIt makes no sense that experiments have to be repeatable?  It's called the scientific method. You really ought to Google that.  If the climate scientists you are listening to think that experimental data does not need to be confirmed by repeated experimentation and observation, those are not scientists.  \n\nAn hypothesis generated as the result of a single astronomical event would be considered an UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS.  An observation is made, an hypothesis is made, more observations, perhaps a prediction.  Confirmed predictions from observations of similar events are observed, the hypothesis may be considered confirmed or perhaps plausible.  If you see something once, an hypothesis about the observation would not be considered confirmed and any prediction based on those observations would be greeted with natural skepticism.\n\nRight now,  the \"threat to humanity\" claim is an unconfirmed hypothesis, not based on observation, but based on conjecture.  It is not scientific.  Not every statement made by a scientist is a statement of science.\n\nI said  \"There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to runaway global warming would look like.\"\n\nYou said\" You're attacking a straw man again, since not even the IPCC thinks runaway global warming is likely:\"\n\nOk, I told you I was ignorant.  I didn't realize the term \"runaway global warming\" specifically referred to a Venus situation.  I thought it just meant irreversible and  humanity threatening global warming.\n\nI'll restate my argument: \nThere is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to one in which humanity is seriously threatened would look like.  \n\nHow bad does the climate have to get in order to threaten one of the most the most adaptable species to ever exist?  Catastrophically bad?  \n\nSee, that is what I'm talking about.  You are making a distinction without a difference.  How bad do the models say it is going to get?  How does that compare with changes in global temperature in the past?  Climate scientists are attempting to use fear and threats to manipulate human behavior according to their beliefs about how humanity should live.  I don't trust them at all.\n\nI said, \"When I hear appeals to authority and to consensus and see great social pressure being used to push a point,  I instinctively dig in my heels.  That's just my nature.\"\n\nTo which you replied, \"That's contrarianism and pseudoskepticism. That is not a good thing.\"\n\nBullshit. Willingness to yield to social pressure and consensus is how you authoritarians manipulate people.  I will never consider my initial reflex to reject majority opinion a liability.

For instance, diabetes, automobile accidents, allergic reactions to peanuts, etc. are serious problems that don't end the world, lead to humanity-ending catastrophe, etc. Similarly, anthropogenic climate change can be a serious problem with serious negative consequences, without collapsing human society, ending the world, etc.\n\n\n\n\"The globe has undergone many changes while humans have inhabited it.  These Climate scientists are obviously no anthropologists.\"\n\nYou're making a very silly argument here. Past non-anthropogenic climate change doesn't change the fact that most of the recent global warming was caused by humans through the production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. To say otherwise is as ridiculous as saying that humans can't cause forest fires now, since humans didn't cause a forest fire that occurred hundreds of years ago:\n\n\"These examples illustrate that different climate changes in the past had different causes. The fact that natural factors caused climate changes in the past does not mean that the current climate change is natural. By analogy, the fact that forest fires have long been caused naturally by lightning strikes does not mean that fires cannot also be caused by a careless camper.\"\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-6-1.html\n\n\"Critics have argued that, if temperatures were as warm or warmer than current conditions before the onset of anthropogenic forcing, this would provide evidence that “natural” fluctuations alone could explain current conditions, since greenhouse gases were only ~280 ppmv during Medieval time (versus 400 ppmv today).\n[...]\nWith the increase in irradiance and a decline in explosive volcanism in the early 20th century, global temperatures might then have returned to an unperturbed level similar to that of the MQP [Medieval Quiet Period], but *the rapid rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gases propelled temperatures well beyond that level, as positive anthropogenic radiative forcing overwhelmed natural variability (Myhre et al., 2013).*\"\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/291523102_The_Medieval_Quiet_Period\n\n\n\n\"Cloud predictions?  A model that predicts clouds is not a model that predicts that clouds are going to threaten humanity.\"\n\nStop moving the goal-posts.

You really ought to Google that.\"\n\nI already dealt with this mistake of your's:\nThat makes no sense. For example, various astronomical events are not repeatable, yet these astronomical events still count as evidence for various astronomical theories. Similarly, climate science does not need to repeat various events in order to have evidence.\n\nSo, once again, one does not need repeatable events in order to have scientific evidence. For example, we have evidence on human evolution from non-human animals, even though we have no repeated that event. We can have a forensic evidence on a murder, even though we have no repeated the murder.\n\n\n\n\"We are not trying to solve a murder, we are trying to predict the future.  Those two operations are NOT analogous.\" of climate change.\"\n\nClimate scientists are trying to figure out the causes of climate change, which is analogous to figure out who caused a death. Climate scientists even use terms like \"fingerprinting\" to discuss trying to figure out the causes of climate change, even different causes of climate change have a distinct pattern or \"fingerprint\" that can different them from other causes of climate change:\n\n\"Application of regularised optimal fingerprinting to attribution. Part II: application to global near-surface temperature\"\n\"Adaptation of the optimal fingerprint method for climate change detection using a well-conditioned covariance matrix estimate\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll restate my argument: There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to one in which humanity is seriously threatened would look like.\"\n\nYou don't read the peer-reviewed scientific literature, so you have no clue what the data shows.

You're basically just making up baseless conspiracy theories about climate scientists, while making incorrect statements that reveal a lack of understanding of the relevant scientific evidence and how scientific reasoning works. And I'm not cherry-picking at all. I'm dealing with specific things you said, and showing how they are wrong.\n\n\n\n\"I start to feel like I don't want to listen to you, because you are not really listening to me.

You're now doing the same thing, so I suggest you stop complaining about it (lest you engage in hypocrisy).\n\nThe likely problem here is that you're not used to the sort of debating I do, which is the sort of debate done in philosophy and science: I address specific points someone makes, and provide evidence/arguments against those points. This is not what many non-experts like you do. Instead, you guys just tend to make stuff up (without any evidence), and rely on the other person not to call you on this. Sorry, but that's not how I operate.\n\n\n\n\"For one,  I do not say that global is not happening.  I do not say that global warming is not caused by human activity.  In fact, I said that the idea made sense to me on a gut level.\"\n\nYet in your first post, you said that:\n\"There's one reason why I'm skeptical.  Simulations. So much of this rides on the trustworthiness of simulations written by people who went into the climate field, very likely BECAUSE they believed the climate was changing and that man was responsible.  How do I know that this bias is not being programmed into the simulation.  \"Opps!  Looks like the simulation is not working right, we are not getting the \"right\" answer, tweak those numbers a bit.\"\"\n\nThat sounds like someone being \"skeptical\" (really being a denialist) about whether \"climate was changing and that man was responsible\". And this person was misrepresenting scientists and their simulations/models, in order to justify being \"skeptical\".\n\n\n\n\"You claimed, \"Stop moving the goal-posts. You claimed that the models made no accurate empirical predictions.\" I never claimed that.\"\n\nYes you did. You said:\n\"None of the predictions of these models are empirical.\"\n\"And the degree and nature of the change caused by rising CO2 levels is a question for which we do not have empirical answers.\"\n\nYou said this before I ever mentioned climate change being a serious problem and/or a threat to humanity. So please don't pretend your claim was an objection to that. Instead, you were objecting to my claim that:\n\"Because the models/simulations are compared to data to make sure they are accurate.\"  \n\nWhen I then showed you evidence of the confirmed empirical predictions of these models, you moved the goalposts to demanding that the models show that climate change was a danger to humanity.\n\n\n\n\"Serious problem and a threat to humanity are not equivalent.  So when climate scientists say \"threat to humanity\" where do they get the evidence for that?\"\n\nI already cited evidence on that to you. Please stop acting otherwise.

Humanity is a collection of humans, and killing humans is a obviously a threat to humans. Of course, we often put up with threats to humanity, for various humans. For example, we put up with smoking because we want people to have the legal freedom to smoke. We put up with peanuts (which kill people via peanut allergies) so other non-allergic people can enjoy them. And so on.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, but increased heat related deaths of the very old and very young is a serious problem, but it is not a \"threat to humanity.\"  Keep your baby and grandparents cool.\"\n\nIt takes a truly unscrupulous person to pretend that increase mortality isn't a threat to humans. Anyway, not everyone has access to adequate home cooling; otherwise, no one would ever die from environmentally-induced heat stroke. And if you'd bother to read some of the research in question, then you'd know that the increased heat-related mortality occurs even with adaptation strategies (like home cooling). For instance:\n\n\"Heat-Related Mortality and Adaptation to Heat in the United States\"\n\nThis is one of the main problems with you, Paul: you just make stuff up (usually, whatever you think will help your position) without reading up on the evidence to see if your claims are supported.\n\n\n\n\"Glad to hear you concede that I'm right about the science not providing evidence that humanity is \"threatened\".\"\n\nI said no such thing.\n\n\n\n\"But you are wrong about the sociology, climate scientists are promoting climate alarmism by claiming global warming is a \"threat to humanity.\"\"\n\nI dealt with this distortion of your's the first time you offered it. Please stop repeating your debunked point. Once again:\n\n\nThe scientists at the IPCC are fairly accurate in their model-based predictions. And when they get things wrong, they tend to under-estimate the effects of global warming, as opposed to exaggerating them, contrary to the claims made by denialists about scientists being \"alarmists\".

You are getting entangled in gathering rhetorical victories without actually addressing the point I'm actually trying to make.   \n\nYou're basically just making up baseless conspiracy theories about climate scientists,\n\nOne, it is not a conspiracy, it is fear-mongering and it is absolutely being done.  I believe it is being done out of a sincere belief on the part of climate scientists that global warming is happening, but in order to provoke people to change, climate scientists are giving their silent approval to climate alarmists by not doing a very good job reproving them.\n\nYou might complain a bit about my changing position.  That's because I'm learning and I don't have an entrenched position.  I'm one of those middle Americans whose friends all believe global warming is a hoax, but I think there may be something going on.  So shoot me.\n\nI showed you that Puttnam video.  In the comments, I dare you to say he is being alarmist when he claims that within a century global warming would cause human extinction.  You will get your head bit off!  \n\nTwo, my questioning of BIAS in testing and interpreting data is NOT a conspiracy theory, it is a well-known sociological phenomenon which researchers do well to be wary of.  It is a valid concern, especially when some of the scientists in question may believe that if no action is taken we may irreparably damage the Earth.  If you are trying to prevent a disaster, you might be tempted to turn a blind eye on  a little alarm.  \n\nThree,  the assertion that climate alarm does not exist is manifestly not true.  Do I really have to fill this comment with references to people claiming that the coming climate change is an existential threat to the human species?  \n\nwhile making incorrect statements that reveal a lack of understanding of the relevant scientific evidence and how scientific reasoning works.\n\n\"As an uninformed skeptic\" I think I made it clear from the beginning how much I know about climate science.  I'm merely an everyday fellow looking in on a subject I'm only marginally interested and running into you, is this what climate fundamentalism looks like?  Insulting or attempting to shame me into submission will not work.  If you really care about the environment, you should study human nature. \n\nAnd I'm not cherry-picking at all. I'm dealing with specific things you said, and showing how they are wrong.\n\nNo, you are cherry picking.  The cherries are the specific things I said which you feel are most useful in your line of argumentation (that I am a climate denier).  The issues which are at the core of my questioning of climate science you dismiss without consideration.  Bias, fear-mongering, and a tendency to authoritarianism.  Those are my concerns, but you treat them as if they are merely tools I use to undermine Climate Science.  I may be doing that on some level, but that does not mean that my opinions are not sincerely held.\n\nFor example, you did not address the video I linked, which is clearly alarmist.  \n\nThe likely problem here is that you're not used to the sort of debating I do, which is the sort of debate done in philosophy and science: I address specific points someone makes, and provide evidence/arguments against those points.\n\nThis comment literally makes me groan and figuratively makes me want to puke.  I've been engaging in philosophical debate for over twenty years.  I am very familiar with the kind of debate you are engaging in (for better or worse).  And I am very used to people who do not understand the other side of a question consistently pushing the debate towards ground they are comfortable with. \n\nI'm doing the same thing this time but I will respond to every point, that is my usual custom, but this is not my field of interest, so I was not following my custom.  It's not some grand thing.\n\nThis debate is essentially over my comment.  Your assertion is that I'm a climate denier.  It is the most pointless kind of debate, because I have already demonstrated that I am not a climate denier.  Just because I am not an expert on climate science does not mean that I can't be sincerely skeptical and question claims that global warming is an existential threat to the human species.  Claims you say are not being made, ok, but, in fact, I have heard those claims being made.  They are implicit in the video my comment is attached to.\n\nThis is not what many non-experts like you do.  \n\nFull of yourself much? I had no idea my comment on this video would attract the notice of someone so astute and important as yourself!  I fan my self in nervous apprehension!\n\nAnd I am an expert.  Just not in climate science. \n\nInstead, you guys just tend to make stuff up (without any evidence), and rely on the other person not to call you on this. Sorry, but that's not how I operate.\n\nHey, before I throw up after having attempted to swallow your virtue signaling, I'd like to remind you that this is not my area of expertise.  I never claimed expertise in this area, and judging me as if I had claimed so is transparently unfair and demeaning.\n\nAs far as the \"no evidence\" claim, that is not completely true.  Suspicions do not require evidence. Motive is different from direct evidence but no less worth of consideration.  And as far as my claim that there is a lot of climate alarm going on out there, I have plenty of evidence for that, I provided one source and really this is a point which does not need to be proven, because it is self-evident.  You are simply denying that Climate SCIENTISTS are alarmist.  When I hear an alarmist, I assume he is basing his alarm on something a scientist said.  That may be incorrect.  But since you have confirmed that scientists say global warming could be a \"threat to humanity\" I think it is a fair assumption.\n\nMy claim For one,  I do not say that global is not happening.  I do not say that global warming is not caused by human activity.  In fact, I said that the idea made sense to me on a gut level.\n\nYour assessment Yet in your first post, you said what I said. \n\nThat sounds like someone being \"skeptical\" (really being a denialist) about whether \"climate was changing and that man was responsible\". And this person was misrepresenting scientists and their simulations/models, in order to justify being \"skeptical\".\n\nWhat it sounds like to you becomes a moot point once I clarify my mind to you, since this is a question of what I think, and on this score, I am the authority..  \n\nI questioned their motives, I questioned their bias,  I did not say that I myself was convinced that there is no global warming or that could not be a human caused problem.  You keep trying to cast me as a \"denier\" but I am clearly a \"questioner.\"  Why is it that you cannot understand that distinction?  Even religious people question their faith, and questioning my belief in climate change is like that, because I don't believe it based on science, I'm ignorant of the science,  I believe it based on other factors.

This is an error of logic on your part.\n\nSo a threat to the whole human race does not, I repeat does not, include things which merely increase human mortality like  \"obesity\" or any of the things you listed.  Linguistically, you are living in George Orwell's 1984.\n\nThese are the things which are commonly classified as potential threats to humanity.\n\nArtificial intelligence.\nSynthetic biology.\nExtreme climate change.  (I did not add the \"extreme\")\nNanotechnology.\nNuclear war.\nMajor asteroid impact.\nGlobal pandemic.\n\nNotice, things at the level of obesity and severe drought don't make the list.  They are not threatening humanity as a whole and have little potential to threaten humanity as a whole. And humanity is the whole of humans.\n\nHumanity is a collection of humans, and killing humans is a obviously a threat to humans.\n\nIncorrect.  Humanity is ALL HUMANS.  Not a collection.  A threat to humans is not a threat to humanity.  On this level I am probably more of an expert even than you.  You are not going to bully me on language.  You are totally wrong here.\n\nOf course, we often put up with threats to humanity, for various humans.\n\nNo, threats to humanity apply to all humans, not to various groups of humans.  By definition.  And I mean that.  This is a major blunder.  Category error.\n\nFor example, we put up with smoking because we want people to have the legal freedom to smoke. We put up with peanuts (which kill people via peanut allergies) so other non-allergic people can enjoy them. And so on.\n\nYou should stick to the environment.  When it comes to changing the meaning of words to suit your purpose, I will catch you.  This is what happens when you degrade your opposition, you begin to believe I am actually as ignorant generally as you suggest I am on the environment specifically and justifiably.\n\nIt takes a truly unscrupulous person to pretend that increase mortality isn't a threat to humans.:\n\nThat, is what they call moving the goal posts.  You went from a threat to humanity to a threat to humans.  A knife is a threat to humans, not to humanity.    If there were no hippopotamuses, it would save a few hundred lives a year.  So does that make hippos a threat to humanity?\n\nDid you not consider that the current climate is actually a threat to humans?  What if the climate changed for the better?  (This is purely hypothetical) What if the climate changed in some hypothetical way so that humans lived longer?  In that case, the current climate is a threat to humanity.\n\nIt takes a truly unscrupulous person to pretend that increase mortality isn't a threat to humans.:\n\nUnscrupulous is the wrong adjective in that sentence.  You mean stupid.  Really no other word makes sense.  It takes a truly stupid person to pretend that increased mortality isn't a threat to humans since increased human mortality clearly kills humans.\n\nAnyway, not everyone has access to adequate home cooling; otherwise, no one would ever die from environmentally-induced heat stroke.\n\nI understand your moral point about scruples, even though your point about threats to humanity was inaccurate.  I care about people too.  And I care about the environment. \n\nWhen I say \"keep your baby cool\" what I'm saying is that people might choose to live with those risks, just like they choose to live with smoking.  But I believe that climate change is being advertised as a threat to human existence which, if not dealt with, will amount to human suicide.  \n\nWe already have people dying of heat stroke (and have had) for all of human history.  It is s serious problem, but people deal with it.  Stopping global warming will not end heat related deaths.  There is (as I suggested) a more ideal climate for humans than the current one.  Death by exposure is a constant threat to human life. (Still not the same as a threat to humanity).  Always has been.\n\nAnd if you'd bother to read some of the research in question, then you'd know that the increased heat-related mortality occurs even with adaptation strategies (like home cooling). For instance:\n\n I think what you mean is that the cost of maintaining a livable environment would make certain areas uninhabitable for all practical purposes.  We have put men on the moon.\n\nThis is one of the main problems with you, Paul: you just make stuff up (usually, whatever you think will help your position) without reading up on the evidence to see if your claims are supported.\n\nMy main problem with you is that you don't see what I am.   I don't really have a position.  I kind of believe in climate change, but I kind of mistrust climate alarmist claims of Armageddon, I think they get that idea from models, so I wonder if the models could be wrong.  You deny the alarmist point of view exists among scientists, but I,  the uninformed moron, have happened to hear the alarmist claim repeated over and over. I see it in movies and on YouTube.\n\nIt seems like you want to demean and shame me into studying the field of climate change.  I don't respond to shame due to the way I was raised.  Personally I think climate science has enough apologists.  I wanted to watch a video where my admittedly uninformed opinions would be informed. This video wasn't it.  I commented and went back to my normal activities, which include total disinterest in climate change.  If I was full before, I'm bursting now.  I'm not going to read a research paper.  \n\n*\"Glad to hear you concede that I'm right about the science not providing evidence that humanity is \"threatened\".\"\n\nI said no such thing.*\n\nYes, I see, you define threats to humanity as threats to humans.  A category error.  Logic, don't leave home without it.\n\n*\"But you are wrong about the sociology, climate scientists are promoting climate alarmism by claiming global warming is a \"threat to humanity.\"\"\n\nI dealt with this distortion of your's the first time you offered it. Please stop repeating your debunked point. Once again:*\n\nThere's the rub, you don't want to address what I'm seeing, you are denying that a threat to humanity means a threat to humanity.\n\nThe scientists at the IPCC are fairly accurate in their model-based predictions. And when they get things wrong, they tend to under-estimate the effects of global warming, as opposed to exaggerating them, contrary to the claims made by denialists about scientists being \"alarmists\". See the following source on this:\n\nOk, but you are saying that a threat to humanity does not mean a threat to humanity, but a threat to humans.  So how can I trust what you are saying since the meaning of your words is unclear?\n\n*\"Climate Change Skepticism and Denial: An Introduction\n[...]\nA constant refrain coming from the denial campaign is that climate scientists are \"alarmists\" who exaggerate the degree and threat of global warming to enhance their status, funding, and influence with policy makers.\"*\n\nTThat is not really what I'm saying.  I'm saying that they believe in climate change and that they exaggerate the threat in order to make us do something about it, because most people would rather deal with the consequences of global warming than do anything about it.  \n\nI don't think they do it for money.  I think they do it because they think they know what is best for the world.\n\n*And this is some of the relevant supporting research on this point:\n\n\"Reexamining Climate Change Debates: Scientific Disagreement or Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs)?\"\n\"Global warming estimates, media expectations, and the asymmetry of scientific challenge\"\n\"Climate change prediction: Erring on the side of least drama?\"*\n\nI'll keep that in mind if I ever become sincerely interested in the subject.\n\nMy claim Right there, you moved the goal posts from threat to problem.\n\nYour response Not a goal-post move, since I mentioned \"serious problem\" *before\" I mentioned \"threat to humanity\", and I made it clear that this was an \"and/or\" claim. Here the first instance in which I mentioned them:\n\nEvidenced by A4 Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity\n\nOk, but from my perspective you've been moving the goal posts the whole time if the point was to address my comment on this video.\n\nI question the idea that climate models predict human extinction.  Uninformed as I am, I assumed this position came from the models and scientists behind them.  I have seen video (either fictional or non) of climate models showing an apocalyptic end to climate change.

I cannot EMPHASIZE that enough. That's what sensible people do. \n\nFor example, I don't know much about macroeconomics and I'm only marginally interested it. However, I wouldn't invent some baseless, silly conspiracy theory about how: \n\"economists are building their bias into their models/simulations, so the economists can claim humans are responsible for bad things!!!\" \nI would instead ask questions about the subject so that I could learn. Or I'd read reputable sources on macroeconomics, such as peer-reviewed papers in the subject or textbooks.

Those are my concerns,\"\n\nBaseless concerns for which you have no evidence.\n\n\n\n\"You are simply denying that Climate SCIENTISTS are alarmist.\"\n\nI'm not just denying; I cited evidence against it.

For example, one can be prosecuted for \"crimes against humanity\", even if one doesn't commit a crime against all humans:\nhttp://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity\n\nFurthermore, public health issues and anthropogenic climate change are categorized as threats to humanity, even if they don't kill everyone. See, for example:\n\n\"Zika virus: a global threat to humanity: a comprehensive review and current developments\"\n\"The counterfeit anti-malarial is a crime against humanity: a systematic review of the scientific evidence\"\n\"New vision, new paradigm: health and wealth for all by 2100 — or for no one\"\n\n\"Infectious diseases are a major threat to humanity, and accurate\nsurveillance is essential.\"\nhttps://hal-amu.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01199455/document\n\n\nYet here you are, acting that something must be a threat to the entire human race in order to be a threat to humanity.

By analogy, the fact that forest fires have long been caused naturally by lightning strikes does not mean that fires cannot also be caused by a careless camper.\"\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-6-1.html\n\n\n\n\"not saying the oceans will become acidic because in fact they are not acidic, they are becoming less basic. The oceans are currently becoming more neutral and projected to not become acidic at all, but we fib and call less basic acidic. We are on course for the oceans to hit ph 7.8 in 100 years, which is still not acidic. Acid is ph 7 or less but we think our viewers are scientifically illiterate idiots and we make it sound like the oceans are becoming acidic when we know they aren't\"\n\n\"Acidification\" does not mean something has become an acid. It means a decrease in pH. For example, blood acidosis involves blood pH dropping below 7.35. So a blood pH of 7.1 counts as acidosis (i.e. acidification), even though the blood pH is above 7 and thus the blood is still basic.\n\nThis is covered in junior-high-school level courses. Please do your homework:\n\n\"Ocean CO2 uptake, however, is not benign; it causes pH reductions and alterations in fundamental chemical balances that together are commonly referred to as ocean acidification.\"\nhttp://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanacidification/documents/doney_annrev_marsci_2009.pdf\n\n\"A time-series view of changing ocean chemistry due to ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and ocean acidification\"\nhttps://eprints.soton.ac.uk/363195/\n\n\n\n\"I don't have any specific reasons why it's catastrophic.\"\n\nDrop the \"catastrophic\" straw man:\n\n\"Polluted Discourse: Communication and Myths in a Climate of Denial\n[...]\nAdditionally, we find that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a straw man used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50).\"\n\n\nAnyway, among AAAS (American Academy for the Advancement of Science) scientists with relevant expertise, there's a 95% consensus that climate change was a serious problem and a 93% consensus that recent warming is mostly caused by humans:\n\n\"Earth Scientists Views on Climate Change\"\nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/\n\nAnd in another survey, ~87% of climate researchers thought that humans caused (or will cause) most of the recent (or near future) climate change, while ~86% of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and a threat to humanity:\n\nFigures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of \"The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016\"\nhttps://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf\n\nThat consensus arose (in part) because there's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause):\n- increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality)\n- increased drought intensity\n- economic losses from sea level rise\n- increased hurricane intensity\n- ocean acidification (which results in things such as loss of marine crops and marine food)\n- reduced crop yields\nand so on.\n\nHere's some research on this, to get you started:\n\n\"Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling, and Modern Observations that 2C Global Warming Could Be Dangerous\"\n\"A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation\"\n\"Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation\"\n\"Ocean Acidification: The Other CO2 Problem\"\n\"Nutrition and income from molluscs today imply vulnerability to ocean acidification tomorrow\"\n\"Economic impacts of climate change in Europe: sea-level rise\"\n\"Economic losses from US hurricanes consistent with an influence from climate change\"\n\"Tropical cyclones and climate change\"\n\"Anthropogenic warming has increased drought risk in California\"\n\"Contribution of anthropogenic warming to California drought during 2012–2014\"\n\"Increasing drought under global warming in observations and models\"\n\"Global warming and changes in drought\"\n\"Climate warming will not decrease winter mortality\"\n\"Winter season mortality: will climate warming bring benefits?\"\n\"Winter mortality in a warming climate: a reassessment\"\n\"Heat-Related Mortality and Adaptation to Heat in the United States\"\n\"Projecting Future Heat-Related Mortality under Climate Change Scenarios: A Systematic Review\"\n\"Climate change effects on human health: projections of temperature-related mortality for the UK during the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s\"\n\"Comparative Assessment of the Effects of Climate Change on Heat and Cold-Related Mortality in the United Kingdom and Australia\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgiU012swSfVyngCoAEC", "text": "This entire video presupposes that the \"97% of scientists agree that climate change is real\" argument is somehow valid.  Is the climate changing?  Yes, nobody disagrees.  However, there is evidence that the climate is changing at a slower rate today than in the past, destructive climate events are not as prevalent as in the past, and we are gaining ice in the south as fast as we are losing it in the north.  Additionally, only 2% of scientific papers on climate change were in agreement that modern climate change has any relation to atmospheric CO2 concentration.\n\nYes, the theoretical model for climate change due to the greenhouse effect is respectable, but unfortunately, the theory doesn't fit the data.  This happens all the time in science.  Just look at supersymmetry, which was a beautiful theory that has now recently been found not to be true thanks to the data collected at the LHC.  Theory looked good, had a ton of support from physicists, but they just couldn't get it to explain the data they were getting.  \n\nThe problem is that there is already too much money in climate change, so despite that fact that global warming models are not able to explain the data (at least not without unethical scientists manipulating data) we just can't seem to let it go so we can go back to the drawing board and start fresh on the science.  It is no longer a scientific debate at all, even though climate change alarmists will yell \"science this! science that!\" without a shred of evidence.  \n\nThe reason why climate change is such a compelling and money generating narrative is threefold.  The guilty party is EVERYONE and not just some greedy corporation overseas clearcutting a jungle somewhere, the consequences are tantamount to the apocalypse, and it is supported by a scientific theory that normal people will not understand but will buy into because it is \"science\".  \n\nFor comparison, you can go tell a factory dumping waste into a river that they need to clean up or you can tell an agricultural export company to stop clearcutting overseas, but to the general public they are unlikely to become interested and form any kind of widespread movement because it does not directly effect them.  With global warming, we have a scientifically backed hypothesis that not only provided a doomsday scenario, but also provided a responsible party that can be anyone on the face of the planet.  \n\nThis is pay dirt, greenies ate it up.  Now they can tell the guy driving a big diesel Ford that he is killing the planet, no matter where he is.  Now the guilty party is you.  And now they can sell you something to help you make up for it.  \n\nNot only that, but the narrative is perfect from a political standpoint, because as soon as you buy into it, the enemy becomes everyone that does not buy into it by default.  You already bought an electric car, you did your part, now that asshole still driving his truck and doesn't believe in climate change is the one killing the planet!

{"cid": "UggROEnb5JuWengCoAEC", "text": "So our friend here Joe Hanson is a Phd in Biology. If that is so, then he has a little explaining to do. Firstly he starts out by making a big claim that \"climate change is happening, and we are causing it\". Well the climate may be changing, but there is no definitive evidence that 'we are causing it'. Even the IPCC does not make such an absolute statement. He has started out with propaganda, now lets see if he gets any better with his list of \"facts\". \nOk, his first 3 points are science based and acceptable. It is number 4 where the trouble starts. When he talks about 'solar activity' he means sunspots. But why use data only from 1970 ?? That is only 3 solar cycles. Why not use more of the record? The reason is because using other parts of the record disproves his assertion. Using the whole solar record DOES show a general correlation between sunspots and temperature. Secondly he claims that the temperature rose fastest during the period of the graph. That is simply not true. The rate of temp rise from 1910 to 1940 was the same as for 1975 to 1998, and it was roughly the same amount.

Naturally, because of the higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, plants have a much more favorable environment to grow in, which means they can multiply their numbers. As a result of this, they can generate more oxygen which we breathe. The warmer world also allows for more frequent rain events because of higher evaporation rates off of large bodies of water, which makes the environment even more favorable to grow crops. This means there is more food which we can grow for ourselves, as well as animals.\n\nAdding on to what you said, a warmer world would also mean longer growing seasons, which then means higher supplies of food, which would then cause prices to plummet and make it more available to undeveloped nations. Hell, I've been told that, back in the days of the Vikings, the climate was so warm that they actually grew grapes for their wine as far north as Greenland (which I think was called Vineland or something). Not sure about that, though.\n\nCooling, on the other hand, would cripple the growing season sooner and longer, cause a considerable drop in food supplies, which in turn would cause food prices to soar.

For example: the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. Within a matter of YEARS (and possibly sooner) after the initial impact, the climate went from being steamy and tropical to frozen and completely desolate. Secondly, as mentioned in one of my previous posts, when the supervolcano Toba erupted like sixty or seventy thousand years ago, it plunged the world into a multi-decade long volcanic winter, only a few years after the eruption. The human race as a whole was almost completely wiped out. Even as recently as the early nineteenth century, Tambora erupted in Indonesia and caused several years of unusually long and harsh winters. It was responsible for causing the \"Year Without a Summer\" in the United States, which brought about massive crop failure and widespread starvation. Hell, there was even measurable amounts of SNOW on the ground in New England in JUNE or JULY, directly the result of Tambora.\n\nOf course it's going to do bad things when an abrupt climate shift occurs (and by bad I generally mean cataclysmic), but that's normal. To suggest that humans have changed the climate faster than anything in history is a ridiculous statement, simply because it takes A LOT to make it change very abruptly. CO2 won't do it.

They'd probably love being in an even warmer and steamier climate. Just because the world gets warmer doesn't mean it'll be consumed by a planet sized desert, and the reason for that is because we have vast quantities of water all over the planet. In order to boil all the water off of the surface, you would need the planet to be hundreds of degrees hotter so that it couldn't condense back into a liquid and rain down to the surface. Such massive amounts of warming has practically no chance of occurring for the next several billion years until the sun finally dies.\n\nThere may be more extreme storms in a warmer world, but there are likely just as many of them in an equally colder one. This probably isn't a very good example, but look at the outer planets of our solar system. They're absolutely frigid, but they produce extremely powerful storms in their atmospheres. Neptune's atmosphere actually produces sustained winds of like 1,000 mph, and it's the planet farthest from the sun. So warmer doesn't necessarily mean more powerful.\n\nAs for the cooling bit, I said nothing about there being cooling at the moment. I merely added onto another person's comment by saying a colder world would hold much more disastrous effects on society than a warmer world (longer and fiercer winters, shorter growing seasons, lower food supplies, higher food prices because of the lower supplies, mass starvation, etc.)\n\nBy the way, I'm pretty sure a solar minimum would cause significant global cooling because of there being less solar radiation being generated by the sun.

(sidenote: the Antarctic Sea Ice is currently in recovery, so it is improving, but with the trend that it has been for decades, that improvement will likely be overshadowed by more melting.)\n\nYeah, you're right the 97% thing is complete bs, but even so in a UCSD study with 928 scientific papers made by climate scientists on Climate change found that 75% of scientists explicitly/implicitly agreed on the \"consensus view\", which is that global warming is real, is man-made, and is harmful to the environment and society. 25% of them said nothing on anthropogenic climate change and instead focused on paleoclimate (climate back then), and none of them disagreed with global warming.\n\nThen again, I do have a mental disorder and should totally be ignored.                                                           <-------------------  not sarcasm there", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "Kevin Ren", "channel": "UCJgUSBQrJIJhWjsO4r3corg", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRaVkm2mnFYdy8FEPPbjluJ3k_wtPCfszMI_AVV8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Either way, the answer is that not just taste pleasure comes into the equation here, one can acquire many things from animals that sometimes are very hard to get from plants (B12 I'm looking at you), and is much easier and simpler to just consume animals. For pure taste pleasure, maybe not, but when there are multiple choices involved, humans naturally take the simplest and least suspicious option available, like eating meat, a natural custom, instead of taking \"weird\" vitamin pills every day, or eating meat, which has more proteins (around 4 times as much.) So if you are making a comment purely on taste, I would probably not eat meat. But normally, because it is much simpler and easier, then I would eat meat, and taste pleasure is an added but welcome benefit. (Some people disagree and say that it doesn't taste good, and I say that they can eat whatever they want.)", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Kevin Ren", "channel": "UCJgUSBQrJIJhWjsO4r3corg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRaVkm2mnFYdy8FEPPbjluJ3k_wtPCfszMI_AVV8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Tradition\n4. Habit\n\nFor me it was just a habit. Judging from your comment you eat animal products mostly for convenience and taste. \n\nAnyway, your next point was that it's unnatural and somehow \"hard\" to take a B12 supplement, yes? I don't see how it's hard, as my B12 supplementen tastes like vanilla and takes less than 10 seconds to consume. So unless you also have trouble consuming Mentos, you won't have a \"hard time\" consuming a B12 supplement. And if you are, for whatever reason, against taking supplements, you can just eat vegan foods fortified with B12. There, problem solved. I just take B12 supplements because it is a reliable and cheap option. \n\nOh and you can't just say \"meat has 4x more proteins\" and then not mention which plant food you compare it to. That's un-scientific. But I'm judging from that comment you are concerned about protein, yes? Fear not because all plant foods have all 9 essential animo acids. \n\nmichaelbluejay.com\n\nOn this website you can find more information. I urge you to read this article if you want to know more. \n\nAnd lastly, thank you for answering my question with intellectual honesty.

{"cid": "UghyDLzhwyVcZ3gCoAEC", "text": "Please keep in mind that this fellow is WRONG and IGNORES a LOT of history.\n\nBill Gray, who died on April 16, 2016, was a world renowned expert on hurricanes.  From an article on his work, \"In recent years, he had been known for his challenges to the science behind human-caused climate change. In March 2015 he wrote a column in the Coloradoan criticizing a Fort Collins plan to reduce its use of fossil fuels.\n\n“He has always been at the forefront of a being a free-thinker,” Landsea said. “All of us as scientists need to be skeptical. If we are not being skeptical, we are not being scientists.”\n\nHe also had a sense of humor. Every year on Aug. 20, Gray went into the offices where the Colorado State hurricane researchers worked, rang a bell and announced: “I have been appointed by Chicken Little to inform you that the heart of the hurricane season has begun.”\n\nBill Gray would fall into that category of people who just don't know better.\n\nHistory:\n\nIn the 1450's French nobility were passing laws against the importation of British wine because it was hurting the French wine industry.  You did not know that the British produced wine?  They haven't because they are now 200 miles too far north to produce grapes in Britain.  Not the case some 600+ years ago.\n\nThe Weather Channel USED to run a clip of a older bearded man wearing a hat exclaiming, \"We haven't seen conditions like this in Alaska for 6000 years!\"  I am a native English speaker.  This sentence tells me that we HAVE seen conditions like this in Alaska approximately 4000 BC.  Now, I did attend public school until my college days, but I don't think that my history classes were all that wrong.  In 4000 BC we have no evidence of a large installed industrial base.  Whatever caused the conditions in Alaska in 4000 BC, it is highly doubtful that it was caused by human activity.\n\nWith the censorship in science, Bill Gray, despite his towering academic stature did not get invited to a lot of speaking engagements.  Anybody out there applying for grants to investigate any other POSSIBLE cause for temperature increase BESIDES CO2?  If they are, it is highly unlikely that the grant requests will be awarded.\n\nHistorically human populations have THRIVED during periods of warmer temperatures and suffered during periods of lower temperatures.  The opposite might be true for polar bears, but hey, I am not a polar bear.  Sucks to be them!\n\nPlease feel free to challenge this fellow on all the bad science he is spouting!", "time": "5 years ago (edited)", "author": "Paul Everitt", "channel": "UCf2WL_nXw-hR3gtiBNEm5qw", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRawkrOuOF-K-Ex-1-J7TsKRKkLxCoZ2AEGHg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjYXhvEpHkYVXgCoAEC.8Hed6AcHL2Q8PQyC7vEsck", "text": "+Steve C D    No the industrial sector in Germany is doing fine - thank you very much. (As I know).  The energy prices in Germany (and Japan) have always been much hihger than in the US. Did it keep these countries from being successful - for instance in car manufacturing ?  The \"Energiewende\"  (losely translated New Energy) is a double-edged sword. A conservative spineless, big-biz serving, long-term  chancellor (Angela Merkel) dismantled the plan of the former government for an exit from nuclear power  plants ( 30 years or older). Instead she arranged for longer operation times with not too much investment. A gift to the industry.\n And then came Fukushima and very negative polling. So she had a \"change of heart\" and went green and  arranged an ABRUPT \"exit from the exit\". You can see that her heart is not really into renewables in the haphazard and erratic way these policies were enacted.\n\nThe thing about renewables (mostly PV,  wind) is: production is already cheap and will get even cheaper. Storage is the unresolved technical challenge. And good storage/battery/artificial fuel solutions would RADICALLY CHANGE  the nature of the energy sector and also the influence of politics in that sector. Green power would lead to decentral, maybe citizen-operated units. At least \"small is beautiful\" would be possible. The old energy sector needed big players, large and centralized plants and power lines through the country.\n\nThere is a political aspect: large companies especially when they are natural monopolists,  usually offer a lot of cushy jobs for ex politicians. Small decentral power plants have no need to \"bribe\" politicians (revolving door, cushy jobs, in the US campaign donations) and they would not have the financial means for it either. \n\nMeaning, that gravy train for CEOs, board members and politicians would stop with New Energy.\n\nGermany is known to excel in complex technology, including cars. They prefer the Diesel motor, the most complicated motor of all - no one can compete with German technology here, the Chinese certainly not. The Japanese would be the only challenger but because of the coincidences of history they never got as much invested in that technology as the Germans. \n\nAn ELECTRIC CAR is much easier and cheaper to build, more durable and easier to maintain - think  brakes, clutches, motor. Countries with less engeneering brainpower could start building electric cars in good quality. The natural advantage of Germany (high techology) would be obsolete. It goes without saying that the German automotive industry is VERY cosy with politics (gravy train, revolving door). And since Germany is such an important country in the EU, their interests are also well represented in Brussels. \nThat was the incubator for VW's Diesel Gate. The pressure was on to come up with  more and more  \"clean\" and \"energy-efficient\" Diesel motors, they were operating at the limits of the technology (it also shows in failures rates, a German Diesel motor used to be a long running, very robust device, now they often fail after only 5 years regular use).\n\nA leader with a vision would have disregarded all these petty considerations. She would have put the long-term success of Germany first, she would have studied the inevitable changes, and would have come up with a formidable research program for storage solutions - in the spirit of the bold US programs like the Race to the moon or the Manhattan project. That would be the new export hit of the German industry compensating job losses in other industries and empowering the rural areas.\nNot.\nMerkel instead did \"same old same old\". She always, always serves big biz and special interests first, if then there are some resources  left, she will throw  some bones to all other businesses and to affluent conservative voting citizens.\n\nSo they came up with an investment plan that favours big investors for solar and even more for wind farms. (And to a lesser degree for citizens).\nWind energy is harvested in the north, the electricity is needed more in the south, they are now building the necessary new power lines to transport that electricity. Remember no good storage solutions yet.\n\nThe financial burden for that systemic change was slapped onto the consumers NOT the industry or medium sized enterprises. Not that it would be that bad IF the whole thing woud make sense for the future of the country. \nIt is a present to the industry with a big green bow. And she could avoid the criticism for the nuclear fission technology.\n\nWith the money they used for that plan (courtesey of consumers!) they could have done much better things. She is not into renewables - but if she thinks she needs them to ensure reelections and good polling she will use them - but not for the greater good of the country or with a long term vision. No, it must be an immediate advantage for HER buddies - big biz, big banks.\n\nThere is a reason that wind was favoured as well. Solar (PV) panels are produced in China. The German producers could not compete with cheap Chinese labour anymore (I would have demanded the use of German manufactured goods for the subsidized projects - not doubt some \"free\" trade agreement - which Merkel also likes very much - does not allow such provisions). \n\nSiemens (German big player) had invested in a wind tower manufacturing plant in Denmark and there are other companies in Germany as well. So wind it was.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Xyz Same", "channel": "UCr51HmsgC03OLi1a-TUlIUQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRLo8jTjFLrCPyzI66VWVXu2ea53jtznbOGCw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Well some people (MIC) see that as massive disadvantage !\n\nThe absolute costs of energy signify little. As long as the citizens can easlily pay them. And as long as their spineless politicians do not make them compete with much less and much more expolited nations.\n If the devices for renewables are produced in the US (or any of their trading partners with the same standard of living and costs) these COST FACTORS also CREATE DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR CONSUMERS.  All these costs stem from someone installing, building, designing, repairing and selling these new energy solutions. It just needs avoiding that over the top profits for a few suck the life blood out of the money cycle. That can be fixed with good wages and high(er) taxes. Worked like a charm from 1945 - the 1970s.\n\nI guess we will need to have more durable goods, less throw away stuff, recycle more, find compostable substitutes for plastic, we would pay more for food and energy, and much less for housing. Big ag is very energy intense and not good for the soil which is a very valuable (but currently underrated resources. So less big AG, and more people working in smaller farming. And we will use more robots and work shorter. Maybe more costs for healthcare (new technologies and higher life expectancy).

When new technology is created that allows us to make these devices at a lower cost is invented, the supply curve increases, the market price will decrease and the quantity traded will increase.

When we have somethign like fusion how ever we will basically be able to use gasoline and other fuels like a battery, which will more or less eliminate any need for electric cars, since fuel is a more stable energy storage medium than any form of battery.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Seth Apex", "channel": "UCjQ6KDEouB6RXir0ylttpsA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTrf5KHgoF7ej5KCJJoF_noT7r9kzyZxai3wPz66A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That's because they are people literally hired by oil companies and such. Do you know why they have bad grammar? That's because if they use bad grammar, ONLY all of the, no insult, \"dumb\" people usually respond to them, only to fall to their side.\n\nAlso, have you noticed that those people also don't use proof? Evidence from another source is useless. You need evidence from GOOD, TRUSTED sources, and multiple of them to consider it as a proof.\n\nI feel that some dude, hired NOT by the government but rather oil companies, who literally tries to convince as many people that global warming is a hoax is gonna respond to this comment and say that I'm an idiot to try to make me feel guilty and left out so I switch sides without even reading my whole comment.\n\nJust try to help the environment in indirect ways for now, like Seth Apex said. More trees and such = less CO2. You can't help solve the problem in a direct way (unless you have a lot of power, of any kind), so don't try.\n\nThe question isn't whether global warming exists or not: It does. It's not if there's a solution to the problem: There is. The question is what the best solution is, and if that solution is worth it: It probably is, but we're not 100% sure about it.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Rikri", "channel": "UCBVau1V2ckDz6SKARVk6fAw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRV4d82RV26m_RCU_TC16oxAHV8-NwNN3OiSw92xQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

To begin heading toward renewables is not in itself a bad idea. It would be great for some young entrepreneur to discover a way to provide the world the energy it needs to continue its population and economic growth through the use of renewable resources. \n\n\nThe problem arises when governments begin to enact regulations that stifle the current means of energy production in an effort to artificially enhance the competitiveness of renewables before the technology exists to truly provide a direct replacement.   \n\n\nThe reason is simple. All of the advancements in technology that the human race now have to thank for elevating the standard of living have a direct link back to cheap and plentiful energy. Humans have been faced with many challenges in the past that have all been rectified by the technological boom we have seen since the industrial revolution (caused by the discovery of cheap and plentiful energy). I might suggest that the answer to successfully overcome the problem of climate change is not to stifle the means of energy production, in turn, slowing the rate of technological advancement needed to combat the \"impending doom\" of climate change. Instead, we should do everything in our power to exploit the resources currently available; fossil fuels, to the provide the young entrepreneurs out there with the lowest cost materials and cutting edge advancement available so that they may create something with a higher energy density than fossil fuels.\n\n\nIn short, allow the markets to do what they do best. Reward those with the greatest minds to be handsomely rewarded by being better than the competition.

Are we emitting gasses that expedite climate change? Yes. Is this bad? Possibly. We know that several thousand years ago the Sahara was a jungle. Why isn't it? Global weather changes. We also know that 65 million years ago California was a tropical forest/swamp. The climate does and always has changed. The main thing to consider is that ocean levels will rise as temperatures increase and the majority of the population is costal. That is bad. So we simply pick up and move. With current statistics I understand that converting our consumption of fossil fuels will only mitigate the time frame for which this occurs. In order to reverse what we've done we need to replant millions of acres of forest and grassland and reduce the rate at which gasses enter the atmosphere and oceans. It's sad to me that people assume this is a One way road. To know climate change is real is synonymous with thinking the Paris Climate Accords were a good idea, assuming we can and should try to reduce our carbon footprints, and that somehow we can accurately predict what the changes will look like. Personally I know the American corn belt is the biggest carbon eater globally. Better than the Amazon Rainforest and better than he swaths of plankton and algae in our oceans. But it also needs nitrogen in its soil and so is demanding. What we really need is to replant forests and work on giving land back to wildlife and wilderness. Without large amounts of plant life we cannot change the climate effectively. So this is a nonissue because it's not economical to give land back to Mother Nature. The real question facing us is how to make it economical, niece people realize they can make money reversing clumsy change they will believe the science. I for one think we should let it run its course, after all it's not necessarily bad especially when you consider Earth was at the period of most biodiversity that we can measure and as such it's likely to reduce certain populations and favor others as environments change. We as humans have the unique ability to witness, know beforehand, react, and successfully understand, all of the changes we face and as such will survive whether we do anything to stop climate change or not.

Zero CO2 means the death of all plant and animal life. 150 ppm CO2 means the beginning of Mass Extinction for all C3 species (85% of all plant species, and nearly 99% of all food crop species). 400 ppm = today. 800 ppm was the approximate threshold which led to the evolution of C4 species to cope with CO2 starvation. 1,200 ppm CO2 is the level at which wheat and rice yield +30 to +40% over 400 ppm. Somewhere between 1,600 to 2,300 ppm is the average CO2 level for the last 600 Myrs. At 2,000 ppm, wheat and rice yields are still +5 to +15% above those at 400 ppm. 20,000 ppm produces yields that are roughly equivalent to those at 400 ppm, and it's  NASA's maximum recommended CO2 level for astronauts for up to 1 hour.\n\nClimate change is the only constant in climate.

Everything the mainstream media says about \"climate change\" shows that it's bad; nothing ever good. If there were a good climate to have, we'd likely have to change to get there.

And the amount of water vapor released from that immeasurable CO2 warming is vanishingly small -- perhaps enough to fill a bucket, but for a planet the size of Earth, that's nothing. So, no. I did address your point. Nothing + nothing = nothing!\n\nWhen CO2 can continue going up, as it has on numerous occasions for hundreds of years, while temperatures go down, it shows that CO2 is a very, very weak green house gas. When you look at Al Gore's graph in his \"inconveniently wrong\" film, you see a monstrous spike in CO2, but we've had no commensurate spike in temperature. Compared to the ups and downs over the last 650,000 years, the spike in temperature should've been +10C of warming, but we've barely had +1C, and that meager warming had already been planned by nature as part of the 1,000-year cycle of warming periods throughout the Holocene interglacial of the current Ice Age.\n\nNow, do you see why CO2 is a non-issue with warming?\n\nBut worse for the warming alarmist side of the argument (and I used to be on that side), global warming is far, far, far better than global cooling at our current stage near the bottom of Earth's livable temperature range.

How about we try this without being rude.\r\nYou say humans can take upwards of 20,000 ppm? Wouldn't you kill someone many times over with those levels? When CO2 reaches levels of \"1000 to 2000 ppm, the air quality is low. From 2000 to 5000 ppm, CO2 concentration starts to cause problems (headaches, insomnia, nausea). It is a dirty air. From 5000 ppm, the presence of other gases in air is altered, arising a toxic atmosphere or poor in oxygen with fatal effects as the concentration increases.\"\r\n\r\nCO2 was at its highest before modern humans even existed, the highest I've seen are 4,000 ppm. \"The last time there was this much (today's level of 400 ppm) carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist.\" You're safety level is a whopping 50 times that! Our current co2 levels are \"the highest in the last 800,000 and possibly even the last 20 million years.” Modern human has only been around at best 315,000 years.

{"cid": "UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC.8H2WwFYWSFT8tyao16dZK3", "text": " @Mr Phwibbs  From our current levels of CO2 and warmth, massive increases in both are indicated as desirable. Let me take your points, one-by-one.\n\nRATE OF INCREASE\nYou said, \"The rate at which CO2 and temperature has been rising has never been seen before in earths climate...\"\n\nFor CO2, and the planet as a whole, you would be right. To my knowledge, at no time in Earth's long history has CO2 jumped as quickly as it has in the last 70 years. But anyone entering a submarine or a crowded meeting hall after an hour or two of conference, will have experienced extreme rates of increase that make the worldwide increase look like a turtle swimming through cold molasses. One video I watched recently of climate skeptics included a crusty old curmudgeon on-stage holding a CO2 meter registering 8900 ppm. Anyone walking into that room would go from 400 to 8900 in the time it takes to gulp in another breath of air. No ill effects!\n\nFarmers are forever filling their greenhouses with CO2 to make their plants grow bigger and produce plumper. That's increases to 1200 ppm within minutes or hours, instead of centuries. Only positive effects.\n\nWarming rates have been far faster in the past with wonderful effects, overall. Not all locations experience the same benefits, but more locations have benefits than do not.\n\n20th century Warming: +0.9C/century (21st century has slowed down from this rate, almost flat)\n\n1817-1818 AD Warming: +50C/century for 2 years after 1816 year without a summer (approximation)\n\n9620-9610 BC Warming: +100C/century for 10 years after end of Younger Dryas \"Big Freeze\" (est. by some scientists)\n\nRead my book Climate Basics: Nothing to Fear for more information and sources.\n\nDESERTS AND DROUGHTS\nYou said, \"Although it isn't wrong that plants will benefit from more CO2, they won't from desertification and droughts caused by global warming.\"\n\nOn this point, you have things completely backwards. You have to ask yourself how land ever gets water in the first place. If you cool the planet, you get far, far less rain -- and more deserts! In fact, during the last glacial period, as much as 70% of all land surface was either desert or semi-desert. All that ice covering North America and Europe was desert! If you study paleoclimate, you find in the literature (even in rinkydink Wikipedia) references to massive amounts of drying out or desiccation during the 50 million years of cooling to our current Ice Age. Earth was far, far wetter during the Eocene -- a veritable garden from pole to pole, and deserts far smaller, but also drier in their interiors.\n\nRead my book Deserts & Droughts for more information and sources.\n\nOCEAN ACIDIFICATION\nDid you know that some unscrupulous scientists used a different acid to determine that pH changes from CO2 would destroy life in the oceans? Did you know that CO2 does not produce the same effects?\n\nDid you know that shellfish shells are not in any danger from an alkaline ocean or even a neutral ocean? And did you know that when shellfish first evolved those wonderful shells that atmospheric CO2 was in the range of 4,500-7,000 ppm?\n\nRead my book Red Line - Carbon Dioxide for more information and sources.\n\nNASA SMAC and CO2\nYou must have looked at an earlier version. NASA SMAC vol.5, p.119, \"RATIONALE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE 1-HOUR SMAC,\" says, \"Mild headache and hyperventilation would be easily tolerated for 1 h, thus the 1-h SMAC is increased to 2%.\" And 2% = 20,000 ppm.\n\nIf you don't already know, NASA is, of necessity, a conservative government agency. People there do not like to take big risks. So, the spacecraft maximums are very conservative and the difficulties are minor.\n\nIf you look at their table 7.2, you'll see that other agencies are even more lenient than NASA. The most lenient is NIOSH (IDLH) with a brief maximum of 40,000 ppm. National Research Council (NRC) allows 25,000 for up to 24 hours!\n\nOne plant study showed that rice and wheat grown under 20,000 ppm CO2 had roughly the same produce output as 400 ppm. So, it's relatively safe for crops, too. It would take us a very long time to reach that level.\n\nGLOBAL WARMING\nYour fear of warming is unwarranted. Climate changes all the time. We've had far faster warming in the past, as I've already discussed. And life does not wilt from even 11C of warming in a 24-hour period. That much happens in mild Los Angeles every day. The feard +3C is nothing by comparison. That leaves ecological changes to contend with. Every species on Earth can quickly adapt to far greater warming in minutes!!! I dare you to find any species that dies from warming of +5C from the daily ambient minimum.\n\nThere are always changes to the environment. If we get +3C over the next century, a turtle could walk the 200 km to an equivalent temperature. That would take a few weeks, and the turtle could relax the remainder of that \"scary\" century, waiting for climate change to catch up with it.\n\nRead my book Thermophobia: Shining a Light on Global Warming for more information and sources.\n\nHope this helps.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Rod Martin, Jr.", "channel": "UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTBcLgEgFRec3cg93TXwvv14L2fOoJDMZDAF9Lz=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You do understand that that would mean AGW theory was disproved.\n\nI'd like to tell you that that has already happened, but the AGW folks have a moving target, a slick process by which they ad hoc adjust something so predictions (actually retrospective, and not proper prospective) become closer and closer to actual temperatures for a time, and they say this is simply how science works...trial, error, adjustment, and so on, but all their work is based on a computer program, a set of algorithms (do this, then do that, then do another thing) that is like a black box that they ask us to \"believe in\".  Sorry, GIGO is and always will be true.\n\nA famous map coloring problem called the 4-color hypothesis has resisted all attempts to solve by reasoning, but was solved about 20 years ago, by having a computer create all possible planar maps and try to color all of them with 4 colors.  They succeeded, though some purists were dissatisfied with the Monte Carlo method...the point being that any attempt to do the same thing with climate would require more time in calculation than the change in the climate itself would take, and any less time would involve assumptions that have to be made by individuals, many of whom have shown a vested interest.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "W.

Our atmosphere is comprised of mostly nitrogen and oxygen (the air that we breathe), where as Co2 makes up 390 ppm (0.039%) of the atmosphere, how can such a small amount be important? The problem is, small amounts of very active substances can cause large effects to reverberate throughout the ecosystem.  Saying that Co2 is only a trace gas is like saying that arsenic is only a trace water contaminant - small doses go a long way. It's also analogous to blood alcohol content and drunk driving, 800 ppm (0.08%) is the limit in all 50 US states. Now as far as humans only contributing a small percentage of Co2, you're in essence correct with that statement too! Natural cycles in the climate emit vast amounts of Co2 into the atmosphere, and they have for quite some time.

So that was in response to your first points, now lets address how we're adding more water vapor to the atmosphere - this all stems back to a problem in the hydrological cycle yet again, which is really what climate change is all about. As global temperatures rise, its no debate that the earth's ice caps have been melting without refreezing like they normally do during the winter periods (around 30%-40% of the earth's polar ice has disappeared since 1979 when we really started recording this stuff). So, as that ice melts it transitions into water in its liquid form (meaning more water in the oceans, etc.), and because there is now more water in its liquid form available in the world, more water is consequently evaporating into the atmosphere as part of the water cycle, hense why we're putting more water vapor into the hydrological cycle without even meaning to do it.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Ryan Elcock", "channel": "UCbFiWsS9t0cCe42W_0yJBwQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS3fZnqdkNlGheJpq9M6lVMWgie2Bo2b6PxkemhuA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The presence of greenhouse gasses increases temperatures, since any light waves which aren't reflected into space go to the planet, and then from the planet back to the atmosphere, and then a portion of them back to the planet, which is reflected back to the atmosphere, on and on. This ends up with a net heating effect. This is what is known as the Greenhouse Effect. That argument is the same kind of argument Creationists make when they say \"If man came from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys?\" It stems from your misunderstanding of the concept, not a flaw in what the science says.\n\nSecond point, there have been previous mass extinctions on this planet, previous warming events, and yes, the planet is still here. The problem is that we haven't been here before. Human beings have never had to deal with temperatures rising on the scale that the models show. Our survival is not guaranteed, not by a long shot, even if the continuation of life on this planet pretty much is. Plus, the problem is not \"1.5% more sunlight\", as you claim. The issue is highly increased temperatures, melting antarctic ice caps raising sea levels, and increased ocean acidity. These are all problems which are being researched, and the research thus far isn't exactly promising. Yeah, the trees are probably fine, but we're not trees.\n\nFinally, remember that \"ocean acidity\" thing I mentioned? The ocean is, indeed, a great absorber of CO2. But CO2 isn't like light waves. It's a chemical. Mixin CO2 with Water makes Carbolic Acid. That raises the ocean's pH, and that can be devastating to anything using a calcium carbonate shell. At around pH 6, coral reefs blanch and disintegrate. Fish die when the acidity of the water reaches a level they can't tolerate. This shit is not theoretical either, it's happening. Measured ocean alkalinity used to be around 8 to 8.5... now it's around 7. And falling.\n\nAnd I'm ignoring the Fukushima angle.

That's true, but your followup with saying that means there is no net warming is patently false, and does not follow from the premise.

This is the very concept behind how greenhouses work, and I don't just mean in climate change!

A single piece of evidence in almost any hypothesis or scientific theory is not enough by a longshot. The strength/ validity of a theory or scientific conclusion is measured by the body of evidence. So basically the continuously piling amount of evidence, (that each has to undergo scrutiny and critical peer review before it can count as such.)  In case of anthropogenic climate change there’s a gigpile of pieces  and studies ranging from measuring ocean/ ground acidity and comparing that to geo and ice drills in that date back x time, Vs measurement of solar activity compared to  lower atmospheric heating and the amount of carbon twelve located there..  The video points to most of these though sometimes in not very convincing tiny nutshell. This is because  the problem with a body of  empirical evidence is that the more detailed and abundant it gets, the harder it becomes to communicate to a layman’s audience. If one isn’t somewhat educated in the subject, eyes quickly glaze over if you know what I mean. (hence me pointing to the link in the description/google Scolar search for sceptics like yourself (that’s a compliment by the way). If you however still don’t trust any of the (I think it’s around 12 thousand from the top of my head?) papers/experiments/studies etc.  You can of course always set up an valid empirical study/ scientific test for yourself, but that takes a lot of effort/time.\n\nNow being a former technical university student, (though with a completely different degree) I did have the opportunity to be a part of an university experiment once taking weather balloon measurements of  CO2 in the atmosphere and its specific isotopes.  So yeah I’m definitely convinced that the climate is changing and that humanity plays a huge roll in it. Despite whatever politicians/industrials agenda, both from the peer reviewed studies by various experts as well as testing/witnessing the results myself first hand (though that was just a single experiment/measurement)\n\nby the way, one of the key merits in finding truth, any truth is Skepticism and Honesty and you’ve shown both of those so Kudos to you for that ", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "jet flaque", "channel": "UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR037Z9BNbDdTNMY3vwLM8dP76xZh_HQXiFcfBH=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Sorry for the late reply, lots of life happening : ).\n\nYeah I agree, the power of Empirical evidence lies in a specifically defined set of parameters, and the fact that the experiment has to be duplicable, making sure that people can re-con/affirm it and get similar results. Herein also lies the misunderstanding when people talk about for instance the 97% consensus.  It’s not that there was a poll and out of 100 scientists 97 agreed for some reason, out of most of the empirically set up experiments  97% concluded positive on data that potentially points out Anthropogenic climate change (like carbon 12), the remaining 3 didn’t but pretty muc did agree that the climate was in fact changing.  So it’s not a “vote consensus” but a count and divide of empirical data.\n\nEvolution is a different topic all together but evolution is in a nutshell another way of saying that if you have a lifeform, and you expose that lifeform to selection pressures, then over x time that lifeform with slightly alter.\n We see this all the time in for instance dog breeding (The only difference is that the selection pressure is human intervention or artificial selection, rather than nature.)  So if you for instance want to breed a dog with more aggressive tendencies you select and breed only those who have those tendencies out of the flock and keep doing this tell eventually you end up with a more aggressive dog race. That’s evolution at work right there, it’s the reason we have say.. Pitbulls. I don't see that conflicting with scripture but then again I'm no pastor/priest/specialist in that :)\n\nWhat would prove that climate change doesn’t really exist… oof..that’s a tough one..  it’s hard to disprove the current body of evidence by a just single piece to the contrary, but what it could be like would be for instance drilled ice cores samples that would not display any change in composition over the x thousand year timespan in which the layers grew. Or us detecting only naturally occurring CO2 isotopes in the atmosphere. But alas that’s not what we’ve seen so far. Not by a long shot :(\n\nIn my experience (but that’s me) science and the scientific method has consistently produced reliable results over time. even though it is always operating in degrees of certainty, rather than absolute certainty. I remain sceptical of various findings however, but the currently body of evidence alongside having witnessed evidence first hand rather than on paper, I have no compelling reason so far to doubt that it’s happening, thus I stick to it (for now).  \n\nThe correlation between humanity’s activity and climate change is for one highlighted by the amount of fossil fuel carbon isotope levels in the atmosphere vs levels several years back. Something the experiment I told you about earlier directly confirmed.\n\nHeh. I’m not a biblical expert of any kind so I can’t tell you if that’s true or not and I don’t really have an opinion on it.. But regardless of the Apocalypse...(and this might be very silly of me so apologies if it is)  but If it is true what you believe, and God did create this world and all its natural beauty.. I’d almost expect that it would be especially the people who deeply believe that this earth was created by God to be most angry towards the fact that humanity is ignorantly polluting and destroying so much of it.   But again that’s just me..I don't know enough about you or your Faith.

During periods of time such as the one we currently live in, in which land mass is not concentrated into a super continent around which the ocean can flow easily, the planet tends to be colder and experience ice ages. The current rise in average global temperature cannot be explained by better circulation of ocean currents, because the position of landmass hasn't changed drastically.\n     Further, it can't be explained by natural solar cycles which last ~11 years, nor by the more significant Milankovitch cycle of ~100,000 years.(To clarify, Milankovitch cycles are related to glacial and interglacial periods during ice ages, such as the one we are still in)\n     The only way I've seen to explain the deviation from these established trends with such speed is that human exploitation of resources, especially since the beginning of the industrial revolution, have disturbed the cycle. From clear cutting forests, to burning fossil fuels, causing eutrophication, to increasing the population of animals we use for consumption drastically, we have introduced factors affecting the climate that previously were not present.\n     This in no way means that we are evil for expanding our civilization.

CO2 only represents far less than 0.1% of earth atmosphere and we are saying it is the main cause of increase in temperature? Temperature on Earth varies depending on so many other MAJOR factors! likes latitude, longitude, elevation, day and night, cloud coverage, distance to the sun (seasons), proximity to the sea, wind, sea currents, the moon, soil types, etc etc etc … and also earth atmospheric composition.\nAll these factors are governed by the sun by the way! I can’t say 100% anymore, since is a politically incorrect word to use in science! But guess what? Take the sun out and no more heat problem I guaranty you that!\nBut no! A gas that represents only a tiny tiny tiny fraction of earth atmosphere is the main cause of climat change! That doesn’t compute at all! We still don’t fully understand how the atmosphere act on Earth. Hell we can’t predict the weather more than a week ahead, and that’s not even accurate! So how can scientific predict the weather in a 100 year time mhm? Predicting the weather is like predicting the market. you can’t look at the small scale, you have to look big! Like weeks, months, years. I’m pretty sure that translate to millions of years observation for Earth atmosphere.\nYou said 800,000 years ago the CO2 level what 190ppm! Yeah sure we weren’t around no denying, but 150 millions years in the past, CO2 levels where in the thousands, and we weren't around either! Plus when you look for chart looking at temperature vs CO2 level on massive time scales, they don’t even correlate at all! Go on google it! AND DON’t YOU DARE USE THAT STUPID WIKIPEDIA AS A REFERENCE! Look for real websites, like at least research sites in .org!\nNow! Are we the cause of increase in CO2? Yes no deny! Would that affect the climat? 99.99% sure (see above, can’t say 100% anymore).\nDo I believe in climat change? Fuck yeah! I just don’t believe we are to blame that’s all. We should be ready for climate change! It’s is going to affect all of us at some stage, but just us humans. Our way of living! Nature and Earth will be just fine. They’ve managed before us, they’ll do just fine with us as well. Only our way of life will be affected.\nNow should we reduce CO2 level? Fuck yeah! We need to be more environmental friendly! We need to minimise our gas emissions. Who knows what we are putting in there that could be bad to our health in the future. Virus, microbes and cancer could be coming from that shit who knows!\nClimat change is a real problem people! Earth has been in various periods of ice and hot ages to simplify, and we are currently due for a change! This is a real problem, but the wrong message is delivered. We don’t need to find who to blame, we need to actually do fucking something about it at some stage. We’ve all been to school so we love to wait the last minute to do our homework, so maybe at the last minute when the weather is finally fucked will we finally decide to do something that’s how I see it.

Consensus has no place in science; it is symptomatic of a science in crisis: a paradigm that can only be flawed because science proceeds by punctuation by brilliant individuals and not by institutions like the UN IPCC, NASA or NOAA.  Science cannot proceed to truth or even one step toward truth using the precautionary principle.  Humans are too flawed to perform science by consensus.

{"cid": "Ughftww4WOXY5HgCoAEC.8CuET-I_UG48Hk7wKlkKjh", "text": "Why don't we all take a page or two out of a new book discussing climate change by Bill Nye. \n\n     \"Modern climat models are extremely complicated, much more so than the ones Pollack and Sagan where using back in my student days. Todays models include the effects of clouds, oceans, glaciers, mountains, forests, open lands, and all of the different gases and particles that humans are sending into the atmosphere. As Earth circles (or ellipsis, sic) the Sun, its axis wobbles a little on a twenty-six-thousand-year cycle. Earth's orbit itself oscillates, changing its ellipticity over a one-hundred-thousand-year cycle, and it shifts its tilt over a forty-one-thousand-year cycle. These motions change the amount of sunlight that falls in different parts of the Earth at the different times of year over millennia. To be accurate, the models need to include all of these variations --- and they do.\n     The results are computer models that represent Earth, its atmosphere, and its seas, using everything we know. Mathematicians and scientists use the physics and chemistry of water, air, and sunlight to create billions of imaginary boxes in the sky. They mathematically simulate air, water, and land. The individual properties of each box -- each mathematical element -- are well known. The researchers build complex equations to describe how each box interacts with all the boxes around it to determine what will probably happen next, i.e., as time goes by. But just as important, they check the models by using them to predict what has already happened; they run the models backward and 'postdict' the past. It's a term of art closely related to terms of sport, especially the mathematics of baseball.\n     One of the fascinating things about baseball compared with a great many other sports is that in baseball, the statistics are especially meaningful. Each pitch is a datum. Each outcome of that pitch, whether it be a ball, a strike, a hit that takes the runner one, two, or three bases, or all the way around to home plate, goes in the baseball record books. In recent years, those statistics have been revisited to come up with a set of criteria that can, as the saying goes, 'predict the past.' Modern baseball statisticians have revolutionized the way players are chosen and used in each game by comparing what has happened with each player's past at-bats with the overall outcome for each team each season. This technique was celebrated in the book and the movie 'Moneyball.\" Any proposed set of statistics is not considered to be of any special value unless it can be used to show that outcomes of the past season are consistent with what these statistics would have predicted had they been in use years ago.\n     So it is with climate models. we want to put certain data into a complex computer program and have the outcome be consistent with climate data gathered from patterns in rocks, pollen grains found in lake sediments, tree ring counts, and the bubbles of ancient atmosphere. A climate computer model is not trusted unless it can predict the past. Nowadays, the models are converging. we are getting increasingly accurate and we are seeing exactly how serious climate change will be.\"\n\nHe goes on in the book to explain how bad it will get but gives hope that we can still do something and hurt a little less and be okay. Its a really good educational read and I recommend it to everyone including those still in denial.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "marvin lewis", "channel": "UCiXAlq0BRrs15d2zyQLXW6w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSIMTj1vjwbouOsNhyozQBLG8NBUoXGhrn_oN9cJg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Clarke.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Milaknovitch cycles that I first saw in a presentation by James Hansen at Bergen Community College in 2006 (about 2 weeks after my presentation, but with far more fanfare than I got).  I asked how it was that with all the CO2 at the peak of heating that the curve ever turned back down (and this on the basis that the curves showed CO2 causing the warming, a fact disproven later).  He was unclear in his answer, and I'll make no further comment about it except to say that he was NOT merely exemplifying a trend without causal implications.  However, NOW that the 800 year lag of CO2 is understood, some including the scientist who found it, are decrying its use to refute causality by NOW claiming that it was NEVER the historical cause.  But it was claimed to be, and that was not true, and the ad hoc answer now says that while it was never a cause per se, it was a trigger.  Oh, that answer eh? untestable, unverifiable, undisprovable, unscientific?  That answer like astrology...\n\nI think there is substantial doubt.

Copernicus anticipated Galileo by nearly a century, and there was still no \"consensus\" when Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter and got himself confined to his house by the powers that be.  According to wikipedia, Aristarchus of Samos had anticipated Copernicus by 18 centuries but there was still no \"consensus\".  Is that only because the old system had no internet?  No, it's because humans have imagined themselves more important to the function of the universe than was true, so no one else looked or they figured it was unwise to contest the \"consensus\" then at hand.\n\nPoint 2 is related to Point 1 in that you qualified your statement as \"based on evidence\", but if it's the evidence itself that's under challenge, then mere consensus has no value whatever.  Ptolemy's strange spheres within spheres were in agreement with most sightings...but he was wrong and his predictions did not envisage moons around Jupiter. \n\nPoint 3 is that the claim of \"consensus\" is completely fabricated in the sense you seem to think relevant: evidence.  Most of the publications on AGW are about consequences and simply presume it as a basis for their analyses of those outcomes.  Thus, all the studies about rising oceans, malaria outbreaks and other disease increases, increased storms' number and severity, increased loss of life, etc., etc. are simply not probitive at all, but the publication of such articles is included in many assertions of \"consensus\" despite their irrelevance.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "W.

There are basically new models of the climate being produced every year, that's kind of like saying some models of solar system formation failed to show the formation of our solar system - therefore the solar system does not exist. Models are not surrogates for data.  \n\n3) I'm not a biologist so I couldn't comment but you could probably find helpful resources from google scholar.\n\n4) Ice forms on the icecaps, not by the freezing of water from the sea, but by the falling of snow, which is compacted into ice over time - similar to how glaciers form. Air gets trapped beneath the snow and that's basically how you can find CO2 in ice cores. \n\n5) Well climate is effected in a whole bunch of ways, to list them all here would be kind of a hefty task, not all of them are bad though. The length of the growing season has increased by around 2 weeks since 1950 for instance in temperate regions. However with warmer seas you could find more evaporation and precipitation in those temperate climates also, and also more energy for large storms and hurricanes. You will probably find a lot more destructive storms and flooding events. Not only that, areas with high temperatures already, like in desert climates, could find water becoming a scarcer resource. Solar activity means essentially the amount of energy that the Sun is outputting. \n\n6) Again what do you mean? Are you talking about past Earth climates, or the present climate? In the present day CO2 has increased first. In past climates its due to Earths orbit, inclination and eccentricity. You should read up on gases absorption spectra if you have doubts about the heat trapping effect of carbon dioxide - there are some fun experiments you can do in your home to see this effect yourself.\n\n7) Other than government policy, there are little things you can do to cut down your CO2 emissions.

We should keep our manners polite in order to have a productive conversation.\n\nThis said, it's true that nothing is absolutely certain, and thus scientists consider a hypothesis certain when it becomes really really probable that it is. 97% of climate scientist say that global warming is man made, and there is a scientifical explanation.\n\nWhen photons (light particles) hit the ground, their energy is transferred to the Earth in the form of heat. That heat is usually radiated away into space as infrared radiation (IR). CO2 and various other gasses, though, can decrease the quantity of energy radiated out of the planet.\nI'll give you some chemistry basis for you to understand this just in case you don't know what chemical bonds are. An atom is made up of nuclei (which are composed of positively charged protons and neuter neutrons, and thus are positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged). Electrons orbit their nucleus very rapidly and they do so arranging themselves in several layers. Atoms that have eight electrons in the outer layer are very stable, therefore many atoms will try to get to have that number of electrons in their outer layer. Sometimes, atoms which lack electrons in this layer share their electrons with other atoms which share their own in return. For example, carbon has four electrons in its outer layer and oxygen has six. Each oxygen atom will share two of its outer electrons with the carbon atom, and the carbon atom will do the same with the oxygen atoms. As a consequence, one carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms combine to form a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule in which each nucleus has eight electrons orbiting in its outer layer. This makes this molecule very stable.\n\nNow, what happens is that photons carrying infrared radiation hit CO2 molecules' bonds and transfer their energy to them. When a bond receives energy it tends to stretch, but while one is stretched the other bond doesn't vary. The two bonds, as a consequence, happen to have different lenghts: this unbalances the electrical charges of the molecules, because the stretched part will have a given number of electrons (four) in a given space, whereas the non-stretched part will have that same amount of bonding electrons in a smaller space, making it more negative than the other.\nTurns out that gaseous molecules can only absorb IR photons if their charge gets unbalanced in the process, this is why many gaseous mocules whose charge cannot get unbalanced do not act as greenhouse gases (oxygen O2, nitrogen N2 and many others).\nCarbon dioxide, nitrous oxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and many others, though, can absorb this kind of radiation making it linger in the atmosphere instead of letting it leave the planet. The more we pump this kind of gasses into the air, the more the troposphere (the lowest part of the atmospere) is going to heat up, because energy that is caught by these molecules causes them to vibrate, and molecular vibration is the cause on the microscopic scale of heat on the macroscopic scale.\n\nPlease tell me if you haven't understood.

We are recording a decrease in quantities of carbon 13 in the atmosphere: this means that the extra carbon dioxide that is showing up in the atmosphere is that we are producing through fossil fuels combustion.\n\nIs this convincing enough?", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Ammonal", "channel": "UCTTEJBqi9mk5QoU8StIVVFw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQAbsxUHeqNNoJJ3kYzW57_DmPapUu6p1gX9A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

When it stabilized in the 50s, though, temperatures decreased a little, before CO2 increase kicked them up again.\nSince the end of the last century, the Sun's activity has decreased, thereby slowind the warming down. 2014, for instance, was relatively a cold year. Don't worry, soon the warming will restart.

It's probably a mixed bag, with some advantages and disadvantages.\n\n2) 3:15 - All ruminants eructate (belch) methane, be they cattle, antelope, deer, giraffe, etc. North America used to have 10 million elk, 30 million bison, and 60 million pronghorn, all of them belching methane, the way large ruminant populations still do in Africa and Asia today. Now North America has 100 million cattle belching methane, but that problem has more to do with degree than kind, as ruminants have been belching methane all over the world for 50 million years.\n\n3) 5:15 - Climate change is not \"the biggest deal\" or \"the biggest issue facing our species,\" and folks would get a lot farther slowing down climate change if they would stop claiming that the sky is falling. The biggest threats to wildlife are poaching and habitat loss. The biggest threats to public health are sanitation and nutrition. The main factors affecting infrastructure are resources and technology. And affluence affects all these things.

{"cid": "Ugia0pkDlzvZY3gCoAEC", "text": "Unfortunately, this video doesn't put forward any of the contrary scientific evidence.  The claim that we're warming faster than when coming out of an ice age is completely bogus.  When coming out of a serious ice age, the planet can actually warm as much as 50 degrees in just 1,000 years!  That's 5 degrees a century!  The video also doesn't talk about the changing rates of absorption of the carbon sinks, like plants growing larger at an exponential rate (and taking up carbon at that rate) when CO2 increases geometrically.\n\nOr the recent NASA study of radiation of heat off our planet (the heat loss the greenhouse effect blocks).  It found the rates were orders of magnitude higher than what global warming theory predicts.  It also doesn't talk about the gross uncertainties of the historic temperature claims based on tree rings (which grow dependent on a host of factors, many of which will be consistent over a range similar to temperature).\n\nAnd, ultimately, it doesn't talk about the fact that climatology is a science almost entirely based on computational modeling.  Now, as a computational modeler myself (dealing in atmospheric changes more in the range of meters over periods of seconds due to objects passing through at high speed) I have no problem with this.  An entire planet's atmosphere is way to big and important to actually experiment with directly, so modeling it seems like a good idea.  The problem is, a computational model is nothing more than a theory.  It has to be validated by experimentation.  The classic way would be by comparing it to known historical periods that we have known starting conditions for.  This was tried in the '90s.  Climatologists said the model predictions matched history wonderfully.  Then all the other sciences looked at the graphs and went ape-shit crazy because it claimed global temperature had been essentially flat for the past 2000 years!  This flew in the face of accepted science and widespread evidence in several MUCH more established fields.  What's more, those models' predictions of what would happen over the next 20 years have fallen just as flat.  And the newer models aren't actually doing any better.  I haven't even seen a validation study of a climatology model in years.

It is well believed in the scientific community that we are on the verge of a 6th mass extinction. Yes, hunting/overfishing/overpopulation (of humans) etc are all large factors in this, climate loss and climate change are going to be the tipping point for most of life on earth that cannot adapt to the rapid shift in temperatures and conditions globally. Humans included.\n\n2 - while there used to be a few other animal species that don't exist in the same numbers today, there are hundreds of millions more humans (just in NA) as well as The 100 million cattle you noted. They have a different digestive tract than the elk, bison and pronghorn. Cattle emit alot more methane per animal than those mentioned. Just because there used to be millions of a different species compared to a species today, does not mean 1 equals 1. This is why its an issue. \n\n3 - Climate change is the biggest deal, because it has the biggest impact to survivability of the planet. If we continue on this path, eventually the positive feedback loop will bring this planet to be completely uninhabitable much like Venus. Yes, in the next decade poaching/overfishing etc are the biggest threats to immediate extinction of animals, however if we dont curb GHG's in the next 12 or so years, then we are destined to an unstable, and largely uninhabitable future within the next 2-3 decades. This is in our lifetime, not our future generations.  The oceans not only provide food for much of the human population, they absorb much of the carbon dioxide.

It causes for lots of heat to be trapped in the Earth's atmosphere which causes the rise of temperature. Now the rising sea levels can have a lot of impacts and not just minor flooding. It can contaminate drinking water by flowing into aquifers, threaten wildlife populations by flooding their habitats and even have a major toll on the economy.

However, this is not really cooling the earth, it is just reflecting new energy out of the system. You could send up a satellite to the Lagrange point between earth and sun where is explodes and emits some sort of dust or reflective particle blocking the sun, but you would need to create a really large area with all the particles.

Because there is alot more water on Earth rather than carbon in the air.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "dallas copp", "channel": "UCwfC5JDlmiV1l3ryn83biHg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRwsVDtNXAnAI2mRTgYcmKMpWAa_DMnHtyQq8zwFg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjHAQT3d1QocngCoAEC", "text": "Another video using ad-hominems which acts as though it is definitive but is not.\n\nPlease, rather than making \"deniers\" look stupid, convince them with enough evidence.\n\nIf you want people to change their behavior you must first demonstrate you are correct. So do it, rather than making them look stupid and leaving holes in your theory. I am not saying you are wrong, what I am saying is you're leaving holes in this video.\n\nSo let me begin...\n\nSun is source - yep\nSome reflected, some absorbed - yep\nBut human activities have increased... - NOW is where you need to start proving it\n40% - Evidence please, this is important, don't leave gaps in your theory if you want to convince people\nTemp vs Solar Activity - I don't personally study this, so for the sake of argument I'll give you that one\nUpper lower levels together - Again, I'll just give you this one\n2000 gigatons - Great, now tell me how much CO2 was added by other sources. Tell me how many other greenhouse gases were contributed by us vs cycles. Want to convince a skeptic? Don't leave holes in your theory.\n2 million million tons - Don't be an alarmist, don't assume I am stupid. Rather, simply compare the 2000 gigatons to something to give the skeptic an idea of what percentage of climate change is caused by people.\nIce Cores - Sorry, but with these current holes you haven't shown that humans caused this. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying you need to fill these holes to convince skeptics.\nUncharted territory etc - More alarmist stuff. Give the skeptics some facts. Show the linearity. In all experiments I did I tried for at least 5 measurements in order to show the linear/exponential relations of what I was measuring. Show at least 5 measurements in those ice cores. Don't alarm me. Facts sway me, not that.\nTemperatures increase - Yes. But you have yet to convince me through this video that humans are the cause due to the holes in your theory.\n10X FASTER - Holy cow well now you convinced me. You scared me in to believing you.\nHow do we know it's our fault - FINALLY, THANK YOU\nIsotopes - OK cool bring it on. Convince the skeptics with evidence.\nFossil fuels from old plants - I don't study this, but I think it's true and will give you this one\n12 vs 13 - Again, this isn't my field so I'll give you this one\n12 should go up - Well sure, but is it the only source of 12? I hope you cover this in the next minute or you just left another huge hole in your \"proof\"\nAnd that's exactly what we see - I'm not stupid. Don't give me garbage. Realize I am smart enough to have arguments in my mind, I am skeptical of everything and am only convinced through reason and evidence. Address the other sources of 12. Address how much 12. Don't leave a hole in your proof.\nIt's not because of volcanic activity - Good, please tell me you're going to address these arguments.\n1% as much CO2 - I don't study this. This is one I am less likely to just assume you are right. I am also curious how much is 12 vs 13. Hopefully you cover this in the next few seconds.\nBalance etc - Bleh don't diverge, go over how you know, go over the 12 vs 13. Don't leave these holes in your theory sit back there and grow and allow my skepticism to remain. Convince the skeptic.\nMethane - OK so you're hopefully starting to answer a question I had probably about 2 minutes ago. PLEASE make a strong logical chain to convince me.\nSimulations - Groan. This is so little information how am I supposed to handle this? We simulate cooling - I can only assume next you're going to say BUT INSTEAD IT'S GETTING WARMER, I can predict what you're going to say. How are you going to back it up. Who ran the simulation? What assumptions were made? Where is the peer reviewed writeup? Don't just brush over something like this.\nAnd that is not what's happening - Well there we go. Please don't back this up with another insult.\nDerp I have no teeth, it snowed, derp - Groan\nTwice as many record highs as lows - Interesting fact. Thank you. But you've yet to convince me through this video that humans are the cause. Make a strong logical chain to convince a skeptic.\nWarmer - Well thanks for that observation. Heaven forbid instead of saying crap like this you address the other gigatons, the 12 vs 13, the simulation, if this is so important can't you spend the time to make a video that actually addresses arguments? Few would argue it is getting warmer. Facepalm. PLEASE tell me you're going to address these things and I haven't wasted 4 minutes of my life.\nA full degree - If you're trying to alarm me at least do a better job than this.\nWarmest in 8 centuries - Enough of this. Show me the 12 vs 13, show me the simulation in more detail, tell me how many gigatons are related to cycles, just fill the gaps in your arguments.\n\nAt this point my fingers are getting tired and I have other things to accomplish tonight. So I won't go point by point and I'll just say whether you addressed any of the gaps you left. Again, I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying that if you want to convince a skeptic you need to show a complete logic chain that can hold together when subjected to the slightest tug.\n\nSorry fingers, I lied:\nUp 8 inches since 1901 - PLEASE tell me you're going to show how many inches it would have been if humans didn't exist. PLEASE tell me you're going to in some way use this to prove humans are a significant contributor to rising sea levels.\nCalcium shells - Thank you I didn't actually know that. Interesting thing to know. BUT you've yet to convince me of humans contribution.\nCurrent trends, warmer - ...and now you're going to say \"but without humans, that would only be 0.5 degrees or something\". Sorry again for more sarcasm. Can't help myself.\nBad Time - Thank you for at least giving me a laugh.\n\nAnd now you're acting like you proved something. Facepalm.\n\nSo let me summarize:\n\nTo convince a skeptic, avoid insults, and instead create a chain of logic strong enough to handle a slight tug. In your case there are complete links in this chain missing.\n\nOne link in your chain is showing the proportion of gigatons. Instead of treating me like I am a complete moron, imagine that I'd like to know what percentage of total CO2 that is annually. Give me some form of comparison.\n\nAnother is 12 vs 13. You never really covered this in the level of detail it would take to tie this together. Other sources of 12? Time graph of 12? Anything? NO.\n\nAnother weak link in your chain, the simulation. Don't just brush over this so briefly.\n\nAgain, I am not saying you're wrong. What I am saying is that when I made up a new equation describing how a new type of aircraft would behave (this sentence is simplified) I showed every step of my derivation. I questioned the result. I checked my units. I made sure that every single step in my derivation was correct and in a logical order. I listed my assumptions thoroughly. What I didn't do was alarm the equation reader person (whatever you call them) in to believing it. I laid out a strong sequence. I addressed arguments against my equation.\n\nFor the love, seriously, drop the insults and lay out a strong argument that will actually convince a skeptic. Convince me. Convince the skeptic. Lay this out in a way that is so well documented and proven that only the hopelessly illogical and mental gymnastics gold medalists can refute your claim. Don't leave giant gaping holes in your chain. If this is so important, take the time to actually convince people rather than insulting them.\n\nLess insults, more strong logic and evidence.\n\nSorry, I wrote this \"quickly\" and didn't proof read. Please understand that each line I wrote was based only really on what you had said up to that point in the video.\n\nIt would be great if people could comment and fill these gaps. What would be better is if someone could make a strong convincing video with no holes in the logic that would take say 10-20 minutes, with links to more information.\n\nGet with it people. Stop insulting.

This is an attack on science and EVIDENCE as gathering your information from a selected time slot of a 4.6b geographically diverse time period is absolute nonsense. You talk to me about lack of scientific understanding and the lack of evidence based reasoning, really? FACT: Fossil Fuels is the LEAST ecologically damaging source of reliable fuel. FACT: CO2 is GROWING vegetation and creating a GREENER earth. FACT: Life grows in warmer environments (it is how we evolved as microorganisms in clay batches of warm water). FACT: Fluctuating temperatures have been occurring for billions of years. How many Ice storms happened last year? Year before that? Heck in 1998 an Ice storm devastated my city (Ottawa). FACT: Northern glaciers are melting, Southern Iceland are GROWING (look at antarctica) cause: El Nino (one of the main reasons for warming periods). FACT: We know almost nothing about the sun and earth relationship. FACT: Water vapour is the main GHG (yet we aren't trying to ban that!). \n\nLets talk the science though, 3 foot water rise? How about 100ft? 1500ft? These instances are documented in the geological time graph of our planet. Increasing heat patterns rapidly? Nonsense, this is nothing abnormal. We have started RECORDING for about 150 years. This is PEANUTS in the geological timeframe of BILLIONS. We are at the highest point of CO2 concentration in our environment ever since we have been RECORDING. Guess what? CO2 concentrations were far higher millions of years ago which is why we find an abundant amount of CO2 in limestone (which helped blossom many species of calciphilic flora). \n\nWhat do climate scientists agree on exactly? That humans are adding to the GW effect? Okay, no problem..I agree.

{"cid": "UghXVQpvDxzWA3gCoAEC.87oBh20tXAC88uzD0T1xTj", "text": " @Robert Massaioli  Thanks for the reply.\n\nThe first one that comes to mind is the Polar Defense Project's kayak expedition. Here is a post explaining some of the problems with that: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/09/09/polar-defense-project-deletes-the-tough-questions/\n\nI'm not a wildlife expert, but the polar bears come to mind, as well. Here is an article from 2008: http://www.factcheck.org/2008/06/polar-bear-population/\n\nHere is another page that is up to date (at least 2015): http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/polar-bear\n\nThere seems to be very little change. The fright is not based upon observation, but on continued assumption. There are other articles I could post about polar bears (i.e., An Inconvenient Truth, Never Look a Polar Bear in the Eye), but maybe you can see why some of us are wary of the sensationalism.\n\nMaybe the problem is not always with the actual SCIENTIFIC models themselves. Maybe the problem is that the climate scientists aren't coming down hard and loud on these sensational claims and documentaries. There seems to be a \"protect your own\" approach, so that the truth isn't what's important, only that people are convinced. That doesn't sit well with me, and makes me immediately wary as someone who is NOT an expert.\n\nIt's like how people used to use balances to see how much gold was in a bag. If you tweaked the balance, you could cheat the buyer. It's the same thing, but instead of gold it's truth. The balance is tweaked so that more is perceived as truth than is actually true. If I see that, it makes me immediately wary of the peddler of \"truth\". And who can blame me?\n\nThen again, it's hard for even a climate change scientist who supports the global warming consensus to come down hard and loud on these things when he is liable to be attacked and called a quack by his own for doing so. So the movement seems to have created its own monster in regards to that.\n\nThen there is this:\nhttp://www.drroyspencer.com/2014/02/95-of-climate-models-agree-the-observations-must-be-wrong/\n\nWhile we're only talking about tenths of a degree here, you must admit that those models seem quite biased the other way, either by human bias or simply by incorrect assumptions.\n\nAgain, it's hard to blame me for being a doubter, isn't it? I'm not a complete disbeliever, and neither am I an angry die-hard denier. It's just hard to see past the sensationalism, etc. to ascertain whether there is much truth. Yes, it's getting hotter, but that's not the proof, is it? It will usually be getting hotter or colder. If they want to convince people like me—who they actually do, believe it or not, have a chance of convincing—then they could start by using an equal scale of reason. Let the whole movement rise up and silence the sensationalism and fully admit when they are wrong. Then they would have more credibility from me.\n\nDo you agree at all?", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "David Odum", "channel": "UC-etbTrRdUhuLf9O7iGMQcw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQPTB7Ciy6l02sTxuAIJKHLZSHajzKnfXOB8hH_lA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(Wells Fargo already agrees to this and will back money out if the engine makes money and increases NOI).  I keep it a \"black box\" that nobody knows how it works. I get the data needed to prove it.\n\nOnce it works and makes money, I buy more real estate and put the engine in those assets and back out the money via banks. The bank becomes the source of funding, not venture capital.  I don't need venture capital, unlike Apple or some Computer company because my technology can increase the value of a building by 60% in CA and 30% in low utility states.  A 100 billion dollar business can be made without anybody knowing anything about it openly, all funded by low interest rate bank loans and not expensive 50% interest rate venture capital.\n\nOnce it is proven we file for patents.  This then saves 7-10 years on the use of the patents vs option 1 where the clock is ticking and industry just black ball me. \n\nNo company like GM, Ford or Toyota or GE will want to pay royalties.  Once it is know to work they will figure out a way around the patents or outright copy it.  This is very \"disruptive\" technology and will not be taken lightly.\n\n\nSo, stupid people take option 1.  Smart people can see that option 2 is the way to go. So far I have not met people who can see the massive superiority of option 2.   All they think about is making quick money.  They can't see the big picture.  This is 10 times cell phones, not some latest app to watch your favorite slut with.\n\nAs far as what people think of me?  Don't care.  I deal in facts, not beliefs.  If you can't see what I am after then I take it you are not someone I want to work with. \n\nLike I said, put up or shut up. ", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "seaplaneguy", "channel": "UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGl4rX21flapZMbwFw70dDTPQeDUqJ02R6tMl_mA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC.87MLi07CHSl89AmhnU7Mq8", "text": "(Final response, Don't feel the need to read it all)\nMethane plays an even larger roll than CO2. which both contain Carbon and are the result of Human interaction and natural sources. Not much point in trying to tax clouds, not just because they can't pay, but because they play a neccisary roll in the climate. Just like how animals + fungi fart/breath out methane and CO2, and plants and bacteria convert said gasses back into Oxygen while making monosaccharides with the influence of UV radiation from the sun. This constantly occuring reaction (aka, photosynthesis) sustains life and climate on our planet. If plants + Bacteria can't keep up with Carbon(because of an increase of emmisions and/or a lack of plants), it accumulates in the atmosphere, heating the planet, to eventually be absorbed by the ocean, causeing an increase in acidity partly responsible (next to dumping waste into Oceans) for high pH loving algal plums exploding in population, and dissolving crustacians shells because they are made of Calcium Carbonate, which readily dissolves in an acidic enviernment. The opposite would likely cool the planet down. Even if there was no warming effects(which there is), it would be worth going \"green\" to improve our air quality(Beijing) and save our oceans, and even with no warming effect, we know that drastically changing the atmospheric composition destableizes the planets climate, whether warm or cold.\n\n I would agree that in the western world we are over taxed for our services, and that E-testing is a huge money grab when a hummer can pass but a seddan can't based purely off of what come out of the tail pipe and not mileage. Proper management of resources is important. To suspect that people who invest in green energy are part of a huge conspiracy is idiodic(maybe they do pay to exagerate some statistics, but they wouldn't need to alter them much). Especially when Oil companies have been busted covering up the harmful effects of lead, contaminating local ground waters with fracking, and the fact that Exxon was just in the supreme court for covering up climate data. BP and Chevron themselves awknowleges the existence of man made climate change.\n\nWhy the heck would clouds cause a long lasting trend of climate change and warming. Did you know that warmer air holds more water than colder air. So there couldn't even be an increase of water vapour in the atmosphere without an increase in temperature or atleast Carbon, as it can form 4 bonds with other atoms and Oxygen can only form 2. Could you please explain the cause and effect of you claims?\n\nYou may be an amazing engineer, and great at Physics (my weak subject) but I think your knowlege is lacking in Chemistry and Biology. Maybe going off of hearsay or opinion more than evidence, data, observations, and cause and effect. I don't often hear Chemists or Meteorologists lecture about Engineering matters, so I don't know why the opposite is happening. The cause, effect and reasons of climate change and even Ozone depleation are covered usually in introduction to grade 10 chemistry classes (at least in Canada). Its because its not hard for a kid to understand and can be shown through small scale expiriments and large scale examples in life. Example, have you ever driven into a city to see a low hanging cloud of smog covering the place, to find the city is much more warmer than the surrounding areas, regardless of if they're more north or south? Or lived near the city to see said cloud blow in and cause a temperature increase at midnight? (yes warm airfronts exist, but had you been in the wind prior to it passing through the city, you would find a less drastic increase in temp, and less stinky air). Researchers in Antarctica have to apply sun screen while wareing winter cloathers, because the amount of harmful UV rays reaching the surface can cause sunburn to exposed skin.\n\nGas Law\nPV=nRT Pressure(P) and volume(V) is equal to the number of moles of a gas(n), multiplied by a constant(R=), and the temperature(T)\n\nLast year texas got snow, year before Egypt got snow for the 1st time in over 100 years. this year Ontario didn't get snow until after christmas. Same time last year it was -25'C. And for a while there, Alaska was warmer than here. Might not be an easy answer of heating up or cooling down for some people. In reality, its unstability thats the concern.\n\n\"I have studied very well into my subject of Biochemistry, and it is in my opinion, therefore fact, that combstion doesn't cause a cars tires to move, gravety and wind does.

More CO2 doesn't absorb more energy from space as most is already trapped by the CO2 in the greenhouse effect. But it does prevent the same energy from reflecting back out to space. Aslong as the flow of heat is the same into our atmospher as it is out, the atmosphere doesn't warm. But when it is prevented from escaping, then we end up with similar conditions as Venus (not nearly as drastic, but same concept). A planet 2nd from the sun but much warmer than Mercury, which is closest to the sun. However the higher pressure of gases and sulfuric acid clouds also contributes to Venus's temperature, as it prevents heat from venting back out from the atmosphere. The upper atmospher absorbs most of the solar radiation, while the lower atmospher holds radiation that reflects off the surface of a planet allowing it to build up.\n\nAnd i'm glad to have a reasonable conversation with someone on youtube.

It is not even profitable in the long run. Yet we won't stop because we ignore this kind of cost.\n\nThat's why a green revolution can't happen merely by changing energy sources.

You are using \"C02 has increased since the industrial revolution by 40%\" and then attaching that statement to \"humans are the cause of the C02 increase\". Then you say it is the highest it has been in \"1 million years\" as if that is a huge number when it is not relative to the supposed 4.5 billion year old planet that is a fraction of time which can not be used as an indicator for an accurate global climate average. That is entirely inaccurate. Really you just calculated the average of 2.2% of the earths climate since it has existed which is not empirical data. Don't get me wrong, humans certainly do add to the C02, and more then they had hundreds of years ago, but to make the assumption, which is what it is an assumption that humans are the cause is not based on proper analysis. Especially when you don't know what the Earths climate cycle actually is. What makes anyone think that this temperature we live off of is normal and not temporary in the first place? That's what I find odd.\n\nThe primary sources of CO2 in our atmosphere are biological (decay & plant respiration) and outgasing by the oceans as they warm. You did not mention which isotope of Carbon these produce. Since they are organic sources, my guess is they are the same as fossil fuels.\n\nThe real question is what part of the warming over the past 160+ years is due to natural variation and what, if any, is due to CO2. Since we've only warmed (from abnormally low levels) about 0.8C during the period when CO2 has increased 40%, CO2 plays only a trivial role, if at all. Millions of years ago, CO2 levels were between 2,000 & 7,000 ppm, or 5 to 18 times today's concentrations. We didn't have catastrophic warming then, so we won't have it now.\n\nIce core analysis from Greenland and Antarctica show that CO2 concentration changes lag temperature changes. Therefore, we would expect CO2 to have risen (with or without our contributions) since the Earth has warmed from the LIA.\n\nBottom line, it doesn't matter that our fossil fuel consumption is increasing CO2 levels. All that does is help the vegetation we depend on for food, shelter and oxygen recycling.\n\nI came here to get smarter, not to be read a poor analysis of data and then add all the intense music and dramatic speaking to scare me into believing it...", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Frank", "channel": "UCuJD4KGI97mqmnfWD-1u5YQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTA8-ywk8iVwPPjD6uRGS9T-F0jAgGzpm_VDQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'm going to suggest that you stop dividing your post up, you're confusing yourself. Your first three points can be summed up in a single sentence there was no need to take a single correction of mine and divide it up.\n-- I didn't strawman anyone's argument because what you're saying there is, itself, a strawman. I only gave a causal mechanism. I wasn't saying that carbon dioxide's ability to trap heat is how we know it's responsible for the recent rise in temperatures we've experienced, I was saying that we know how carbon dioxide does this; something the original poster didn't know or understand.\n-- That's still not what cherry picking is. I didn't mention it because it wasn't relevant, I wasn't discussing what other effects carbon dioxide can have I was explaining how carbon dioxide can trap heat.\n-- And your point on what a causal mechanism is, even your clarification, still wrong. This is why I'm suggesting that you don't divide up your replies, you've confused yourself.\nLook, you threw around some terms you thought were fancy without knowing what they mean and you got called out on it. Stop trying to retroactively justify you using them wrong. Nobody gives a shit. Just stick to terms you know, this is cringe inducing.\n\nAnd now back to hypocritically addressing your post one point at a time after I just explained to you why you shouldn't do the exact same thing I am:\n\"It [carbon dioxides ability to trap heat] is only a casual mechanism for global warming if you ignore all other effects of C02.

Your original reply simply read \"Citation needed.

This has not been demonstrated\"\nI didn't say that, this is a straw man.

How would you have known?\n\nWhatever, this isn't particular difficult stuff.\n\"These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2 concentrations is an explanation for much of the temperature change at the end of the most recent ice age\"\n-Shakun, 2012\nHis model, of course, deals with what you call \"net-warming\" like all climate models. Which is why I was confused as to why you bothered to use that term at all since these are real world numbers and not those under laboratory conditions.\n\n\"CO2 and other molecules with a similar structure (e.g. O3, H20) insulate the earth. This greenhouse effect keeps the earth’s surface temperature at a habitable level of about 14 °C (57°F) instead of the temperature -19 °C (-2.2 °F) which it would have without the atmosphere absorbing the radiated IR. Thus, the greenhouse accounts for approximately a 33°C (59°F) warming (Le Treut et al., 2007). By trapping energy, the greenhouse heats the earth and its atmosphere by raising the radiative equilibrium\"\n-Jordan, 2013\nJordan then, of course, goes on to explain how the ability of carbon dioxide to absorb heat works on a global scale. He then goes on to say:\n\"The NIR bands of absorption in CO2 significantly affect the thermal budget of the mesosphere. NIR absorption by CO2 can contribute up to 30% of the total solar heating in the mesosphere... However, the inclusion of NIR parameters does not significantly change the model’s thermal response to a doubling of CO2; therefore, the radiative forcing not strong enough to have an overall effect\"\nEven with all possible perimeters covered it doesn't change anything; the effect remains the same. Carbon dioxide-based heating is primarily done in the upper atmosphere. Jordan's model shows that the exact amount of heating we'd expect to see if carbon dioxide was uninhibited is what we observe in current trends.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Uzziya", "channel": "UCX4hdT8-r500SzWwO3xj2AA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS9KMek_iGASvEiKtpeiVle4DngNOhq9rMw04aI-g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

No events or facts will disprove this theory as the theory will simply change to become consistent with new data and speculation. CO dissipates so that's not really going to be an issue long term as fossil fuels will run out sooner rather than later. Moreover, there is way more vegetation on this planet now than ever before as humans bend over backwards preventing forests from burning down. Plants absorb CO. This whole concept has turned into a belief system which is why I opt out of \"following\" the theory. There are way to many variables to actually create a theory that will be anything close to true. Perhaps if everything was observed for about 300 million years I would consider simply believing a theory on this. \n\n\nFor now, I just look at facts and any obvious correlations. For example, CO from emissions and CO being absorbed by the ocean is a huge deal. The video was misleading as anything above a PH of 7 is not considered acidic. However, changes in the equilibrium throws everything off. In the end it wont matter. Just like a fish tank, when something is changed it throws the balance off but then it adapts. You add a plant then the plant absorbs nitrates ammonia and CO. In this case algae may die off but fish may be more healthy. You add a bubbler, then it moves water to much at the surface causing CO to dissipate then the plant may die and nitrates and ammonia may go up causing a fish to die then a huge ammonia spike causing a bacteria bloom and you have cloudy water. If you do nothing, it sorts itself out. \n\n\nAnyway, my whole point is, within this theory they have lots of neat little correlations. Like the CO type from emissions from fossil fuels from plant matter. But that's all it is. There are way to many variables to connect little correlations with other little correlations. All murderers eat plant and/or animal mater. The plants and animals have very little correlation with the actual murders. Some but very little and changing those variables probably wont change the outcome. I eat plants and animals, I never murdered. BTW, one thing that is consistent is cooling periods. Not the time between them but the pattern that lead up to them. Id buy a jacket as 2016 will be the beginning of the next cooling period.

As it is, the reaction to climate change has been one of negativity and opportunity through inconvenience. I believe a better path forward would be to observe beneficial changes to make in adjusting to the ever changing climate in developed nations, then advocating those changes down to lesser developed countries. The problem with stopping or solving climate change is that it cannot be stopped or solved, because it is ever occurring since the beginning of  climates themselves. A motive spread in greed is greatly more powerful than fear in my opinion, and in my opinion, if marketed properly would be much more effective in achieving the kind of results the fear campaign has sought after. Climate change is inevitable. The degree to which it changes can be manipulated through greed in the right direction. Much easier to convince than fear. Especially so, when not everybody shares the same fear, as  evidenced by the fact of deniers, corporate interests, and subtle disagreement on cause variations. Even the producers of \"It's Okay To Be Smart\" could not mount an argument proper enough to quell dissident on climate change through the fear motive.

Our actions are the cause of global warming. And if we wait, then were screwed.  We might already be screwed because we waited to long.  This isn't something that we can all of a sudden fix.  We should have been changing our behaviour years ago, but we didn't.  But that shouldn't prevent us from trying to change our behaviour now.  The longer we wait though, the worse the repercussions.

So in the Antarctic winter the less saltier surface water froze in larger area's because of the melting the previous summer.

In fact, with all of the \"pollution\" humans have been doing, the Earth is greener than it has ever been. CO2 is good for the Earth, not bad. They just want you to believe it's bad. Then you find out that they are just saying it's bad so the UN can restrict other countries. They are focusing hard on China, they do not want China to advance as a country.\n\nSecondly, the Earth goes through climate change naturally. Before the Ice age there was a time when the Earth didn't even have polar ice caps. That's right, in Earth's time when it's teeming with life, it was hotter than it is now. We are still in an Ice Age and it's coming to a natural end. You need to find this evidence yourself. Look into it, don't let people spoon feed you information and then choose to ignore it.

No.\nThe natural temperature cycle of the Earth does not shift so intensely in periods of years, or decades (as much as 1-3 degrees) naturally.\nNow, I'm not gonna ask you to blindly trust what I'm telling you, so you can check NASA's climate stats if you would like. http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp\nLastly, my type?

{"cid": "UgiMGAnv41_-9HgCoAEC", "text": "Ever since the whole global-warming fracas began, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has been fudging and faking evidence and statistics in order to give the illusion that there was proof of human-caused global warming.\n\nThis is well known, though unmentioned by our monolithic true-believer media, whose science coverage has become a mere church choir in the religion of eco-puritanism.\n\nThe IPCC have performed illegitimate and unjustified statistical manipulations; they have reworded reports after scientists signed off on them, and without their knowledge.\n\nThese are the kinds of things that you only do when you know that the evidence does not make your case. Nobody steals an election they've actually won.\n\nThrough all of this, they have insisted that human-caused global warming is a fact, and that anyone who resists it is in the same category as creationists and holocaust-deniers.\n\nThis namecalling is another confession that they haven't got the data to make their case. If you have the data, you don't have to call names. The science speaks for itself.\n\nOne reason they have been able to get away with this is the lack of data to contradict them. That is, the data we have had up to now did not say what they claim it said -- but it didn't say anything else, either.\n\nThat's because everything was based on computer models, and computer models are only as good as the data that is fed into them. The people running the simulations were all True Believers, and so they always came up with \"results\" that mirrored the biased data they had been fed.\n\nBut finally there is real data to feed into the computers. In a Dec. 18th Wall Street Journal essay, Matt Ridley reports on a conversation with Nic Lewis, one of the educated people keeping tabs on the global warming science issues for those of us who don't have access to the latest reports.\n\nIf it weren't for people like Lewis, we laypeople would have no choice but to believe the deceptions of True Believers like the IPCC. Lewis is part of the reason we know about the previous lies and manipulations by the IPCC, but no one denies that the deceptions took place.\n\nNow, however, because Lewis is an honest observer, he reports that real data shows that there is a genuine statistically probable effect from atmospheric carbon emissions.\n\nWhat genuine scientists, faithfully reporting their actual findings, now report is that the mechanisms claimed to cause global warming may in fact contribute to a rise in temperature -- but they do so at a rate FAR, FAR LOWER than that assumed by the True Believers.\n\nWe are finally getting a pretty good idea of the actual effects of carbon dioxide emissions. Comparing global temperatures over the past 100-150 years with the fluctuations in carbon dioxide emissions from human activities gives us -- at last -- a reasonable basis for estimating how sensitive global climate is to changes in carbon dioxide levels.\n\nKeep in mind that carbon dioxide is far from being the major greenhouse gas. Methane is far more important, and the most important, water vapor, has such unpredictable effects that it is left out of all the models.\n\nThat's because water vapor, besides being a greenhouse gas, also forms clouds, which by their high reflectivity, bounce sunlight out of the atmosphere without converting it to heat. Storms also funnel heat from near the surface up to the higher atmosphere.\n\nWe have no way of predicting or modeling how much the albedo and storm effects balance with the greenhouse effect, nor even to what degree global warming would increase cloud cover.\n\nAs Ridley says in his article, \"As one Nobel Prize-winning physicist with a senior role in combating climate change admitted to me the other day: 'We don't even know the sign' of water vapor's effect -- in other words, whether it speeds up or slows down a warming of the atmosphere.\"\n\nSays Ridley, \"Climate models are known to poorly simulate clouds, and given clouds' very strong effect on the climate system -- some types cooling the Earth either by shading it or by transporting heat up and cold down in thunderstorms, and others warming the Earth by blocking outgoing radiation -- it remains highly plausible that there is no net positive feedback from water vapor.\"\n\nThis matters a great deal -- the global warming alarmists' warnings absolutely depend on the idea that carbon dioxide's warming, if real, will then be greatly amplified by water vapor increases. But this remains entirely a matter of faith. For all we know, increased water vapor may be the ecosystem's natural way of damping down the effects of global warming -- whether that warming is astronomical or human caused.\n\nWe can now calculate with some reliability just what a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would do to global climate. \"Given what we know now,\" said Ridley, \"there is almost no way that the feared large temperature rise is going to happen.\"\n\nRidley quotes Lewis as saying that, assuming a doubling of CO2 -- the IPCC's worst-case scenario -- and even assuming \"another 30% rise from other greenhouse gases by 2100, we are likely to experience a further rise of no more than\" one degree Celsius.\n\nSays Ridley, \"A cumulative change of less than 2O C by the end of this century will do no net harm. It will actually do net good -- that much the IPCC scientists have already agreed upon in the last IPCC report. Rainfall will increase slightly, growing seasons will lengthen, Greenland's ice cap will melt only very slowly.\"\n\nHistorical evidence shows that global temperatures have been warmer than they are now, following natural cycles alone, in historical times. There seems to be a regular warming-and-cooling cycle, with cooling represented by the Little Ice Age of 1350 to 1850. In 1000 a.d., global climate was warmer than it is now.\n\nThe same cycle seems to have corresponded with the collapse of agriculture and population during the cooling phase in the late Roman Empire and through the Dark Ages -- a plague-ridden era like the Little Ice Age.\n\nThe historical evidence suggests that eras of global warming are natural, that they are beneficial, that they can best be called \"good weather.\"\n\nWhen you add to this the fact that all of human history has taken place in a ten thousand year lull in the great Ice Age that has dominated the last million years of Earth's climate history, and I, for one, wish that we could control and warm the climate through mere carbon dioxide emissions -- because when the major astronomical cycles bring back the Ice Age, our descendants will very much wish for a means of causing global warming on a vast scale.\n\nMeanwhile, keep in mind that there is nothing unnatural about the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere. All the carbon in the coal and oil and natural gas that we dig or pump up from under the surface was once atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\nCarbon dioxide is fertilizer for all plant life. For millions of years, the coastal jungles of the dinosaur era sequestered natural atmospheric carbon dioxide and kept it out of circulation.\n\nIn effect, we have starved for CO2 for millions of years because all those plants selfishly drank up all the atmospheric carbon they could and then thoughtlessly died without returning it to the atmosphere.\n\nWe're only putting it back where it started.\n\nAnd every serious climate scientist has to admit this fact: Whatever else our carbon dioxide emissions might be doing, they are definitely fertilizing forests and grasslands all around the world. Where humans are involved, that means orchards and grainfields.\n\nIf we really did reduce our CO2 emissions, it would cause a worldwide decrease in crop yields. That's a fact, not a computer model.\n\nThe real limiting factor should be this: The supply of oil and coal is finite. It was larger than the alarmists of the 1970s and 1980s supposed, but that doesn't mean that we will never run out. It is quite possible that in a mere two centuries of fossil fuel consumption, we will use up the entire supply of accessible sequestered carbon.\n\nThat, not groundless fears of global warming, is the reason we need to find other means of generating energy. Instead of worrying about carbon emissions, we need to search desperately for a means of powering our transportation and heating and cooling our habitations that does not depend on a resource that, once it runs out, is gone forever.\n\nMy fear is that because of all the lies and deceptions, all the oppression of dissent and nastiness of the global warming alarmists, the general public, once free of those delusions and lies, will think that all warnings and dangers are false.\n\nIn other words, we have been through three decades of massive wolf-crying about a nonexistent wolf, so that people won't believe in the need to deal with the real wolf of depleting resources.\n\nWe have a responsibility to future generations to leave them with the resources necessary to sustain a modern society. It is a sin to burn it all up when we don't have to. CO2 is a non-issue and always has been -- only the eco-puritans took it seriously and then foisted it on laypeople who trusted in \"science.\"\n\nThe net effect of their falsehoods will be a loss of trust in real science, and that's a crime. Because there are dangers to the environment, and serious consequence from burning up resources that can never be renewed.

You're right in one way; we have better instruments now than before 1979 and before we relied on ground stations.

{"cid": "UgihRl2Mjir8eHgCoAEC.8-pWGjZjrPW70nuGBPlkIH", "text": " @Brian Stuart   You should stop listening to news agencies--reputable or not--because news agencies are not peer-reviewed scientific publications. You should start listening to peer-reviewed scientific publications because that is where real information is found. The world's peer-reviewed scientific publications agree with virtual unanimity that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. That is how things are in reality.\n\nNOAA and other scientific organizations adjust their figures according to the data. As new data comes in, it is incorporated into the broader analysis, returning new figures for publication. As this scientific process carries on, our insight into climate systems increases in sophistication, and our understanding of their behaviour becomes more certain. Utilizing this data, i.e., evidence, the conclusion of NOAA and all other major scientific organizations is that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. That is how things are in reality.\n\nArctic ice is declining. Record lows are recorded year over year, and have been for decades. The process is not linear--some years will see more ice recovery in the winter, and less ice loss in the summer--but the overall trend remains down. Because of this reality, an ice-free Arctic in the summer is not only expected, but inevitable. That is how things are in reality.\n\nOver and over again, the predictions of climatologists are proven correct, or they are proven to be underestimations as opposed to overestimations. Projections in CO2 concentration and its correspondent temperature rise have closely paralleled observations. Projections in Arctic sea ice decline fell far short of observations. Most notably, observed sea level rise between 1993 and 2007 far exceeded projections rendered by the 1995 and 2001 IPCC synthesis reports. If anything, the scientific community has been too conservative in their projections, and the climate is changing more abruptly than they anticipated. That is how things are in reality.\n\nThe bottom line is this. If we fail to act on climate change, hundreds of millions of people will be displaced, and hundreds of thousands will die. Food and water security will collapse in many parts of the world, and enormous populations will suffer under it. Conflicts will erupt as a result. If we do act on climate change, and if we do implement carbon neutral technologies which already exist and can be deployed at once, we can solve our energy problems without depriving anyone of anything, instead increasing the security of people around the globe. That is how things are in reality.\n\nAll of this as a response to a proven fact: anthropogenic climate change. You, in your ignorance and bias, would have us ignore the facts, to embrace industry rhetoric, and to idle on the most pressing issue of our time. It's because of your line of thinking that there is a disagreement between public opinion and scientific evidence, and it's because of this disagreement that much needed action remains idle. That is how things are in reality.\n\nMake no mistake: you are on the wrong side of history.

Like the possibility of accelerated evolutionary change in plants and animals due to a increasing environmental danger (which may spawn species that soak up all that extra CO^2), as well as human technology advancing and being able to compete against fossil fuels and create stability in the ecology (and economy :P) or even bio engineering plants to, again, soak up all that CO^2; decreasing deforestation due to the over abundance of trees. Computers have come along quite quickly in 30 years, and we've been trying to do the green energy for roughly 25 years. I say give green energy technology another 5-15 years to be able to equal the energy output that fossil fuels can produce, which would increase business within that technology, and finally another 5 years to become mainstream and the norm.\n    Secondly, I have faith in the ecology of the planet, that even if there is drastic change that life will find a stability.

Also what he said that people will not disagree with the group. The same applies to scientists. I feel that there is not a real debate, climate change. Because when you want to discuss it seriously people say \"The boat has left, it is so!\" \n\nLike I have never got a actual good explanation on how CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere.  0.0397% of the atmosphere is CO2, a tiny amount. How can such tiny substance have such a great effect on the climate?\n\nSun activity, I would like to see some non-disputable data that the sun-activity has gone down. Like, think, just seasons like summer on the north side of the earth and winter at the same time on the south side is due to earth's tilt. A tiny variable , the tilt of the earth, makes the seasons. Thus I think the sun must be a bigger culprit , than it is portrayed today. \n\nAlso, there is a lot of tax money in CO2 taxes. And scientists wanting to study the sceptics view get denied funding. So there is a incentive for the government to encourage the belief in global warming to get more revenue. My point is that I think the sciences is biased. 500 years ago it was a know fact, that the earth was in the centre of the universe with the heliocentric world view. 97% of the scientists of the day supported that view! \n\nMy biggest worry is the acidity of the oceans. But wouldn't algae counter that? \n\nBut again, not taking the sceptics serious is the leading cause that you will have allot of sceptics because one just looks so biased when you ridicule like \"Its okay to be smart\" did.

In reality, data indicates that temperatures have been rising at a rate of 0.116°C per decade since 1998, which is three times faster than previously thought, and entirely in line with earlier projections.\n\nStudies reported by the IPCC in 2013 had suggested that global warming slowed or paused during the period of 1998 to 2012. More thorough research shows the global warming \"hiatus\" likely never happened, but instead was caused by a failure to account for cooler temperature readings collected by ocean buoys, whose presence in the oceans had increased during the same period. http://earthsky.org/earth/global-warming-hiatus-never-happened-study-says\n\nAre you going to adjust your view to accommodate new and updated data, or are you going to cling to the old and outmoded data because it supports your existing beliefs?  It's up to you.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Ryan M", "channel": "UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS1Ipbw0o5VXgbfZ0pMaX68nPptFSuz8KMQlSQgOw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As thus it seems only reasonable for developing countries to demand some compensation. HOWEVER, this does not mean they do not have to make an effort for environmentally sustainable industry. They say that future generations learn from the mistakes of the previous ones; let's not make a repeat of what happened and is happening following the European industrial age.\n\nThere are 7.3 BILLION people on the globe! It's the small things every individual can do that count. Here are a few simple things that EVERY one can do for the sake of the planet that's our and our children's home:\n\n- Live in a city? Why not commute by public transit, even if its only a couple of times a week? Helps create jobs and saves big time on car expenses.\n-Going shopping? Take a few reusable bags to carry your goods back home. Canvas or even the old plastic bags you used last time will do.\n-Groceries? Make an effort to favor seasonal goods, especially in the produce section. Thing grown and produced nearby are often much more cleaner and you support the local community at the same time, even if you don't buy organic.\n-Have a heater? Try dropping the temperature down a bit. Even a drop of one degree is significant and will definitely show in your next electricity bill.\n-Or air-conditioning? Give the machine a break and throw open the window. The outside air is often times more cleaner than the recycled air flowing through your vents.  \n-Turn of the lights when you don't need them. Prefer natural light during day-time: it's much healthier for both your eyes and mind.\n-Throwing out the rubbish? Try sorting your trash, even if its only between biodegradable(food stuffs and the sort) and mixed rubbish. Sorting out glass and paper helps with recycling.\n-Got old furniture? Make a trip to the recycling center. One man's trash is another one's treasure, after all.\n      ", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Pascal's triangle", "channel": "UCS3hDDTkM5nYQ00Z8DAroxA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTJJlz3nrSBZqghwDEP8Or_n1BP6sV1nGv0Qg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Several diseases are blamed from the rising temperatures notwithstanding the number of disease carrying insects that infect human, animals and crops. Here in Hampton Roads, Virginia we had three snowstorms within last week Feb 2015 which never occurred before. The most common denominator on this weather phenomenon is the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere.\nSimple explanation: The warming of the Pacific Ocean pushes the Pacific rim jet stream deep into the arctic circle.frigid atmosphere Then, like a balloon the arctic circle atmospheric pressure gets deformed and transferred that energy which pushes cold front jet stream into the area of less atmospheric resistance. It find its way into the US Midwest where the Mexican Gulf moisture resides.

Also, your use of theory to suggest that it is unsupported tells me that you don't understand what a theory is. Climate Change is not a theory. It is a phenomenon. A theory is a scientific statement drawn from the vast majority of data that answers a wide range of scientific questions that is testable and is supported by data. An example of a theory is \"Human Activity is causing a large amount of Climate change.\". This is supported by the data, as we see that CO2 in the atmosphere is trapping huge quantities of heat, and we are the only ones producing enough CO2 to explain the amount in the atmosphere. It answers a lot of questions, the largest of which is \"Why is the planet getting hotter\" (by the way, the last 3 decades were the hottest on record. Every year for the past 10 years has been hotter than the last. Before you bring up your beloved 18 year pause, that pause doesn't mean no rise in climate, it means far less than the previous years.

Considering earth climate gets hotter and colder by natural means there's nothing to suggest man has caused this. So it can only be caused by greenhouse gases? Again non sense. Furthermore the pause in warming, and yes pause because there is not even a small discernible warming, of the last 18 years or so while CO2 continues to increase. Points that climate is not as sensitive to CO2 otherwise there would be a continued warming trend. Anything to suggest its an anomaly is just a theory, and furthermore highly, highly unlikely. You dont see 18 year anomalies while trying to pin warming on CO2 even though its rising. Its inconsistency points to a far lesser climate sensitivity, to the point if any warming at all has been induced by it. The halocene period around 7,000 years ago has seen 2+c warmer than today which would put on average 1c over the proposed limit. So the earth has experienced it naturally.

{"cid": "Ugg4eZWAXQAaUngCoAEC", "text": "So much bullshit gets slung by the paid professionals in the Church of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming that one needs supersized muck boots to wade through it.  Not to be outdone by the pros there are legions of followers who declare their faith, chant their catechisms and demand their pound of flesh from any who would truck with apostasy.  What a revolting scourge this is, what a stain on the reputation of Science and Western Civilization that a cesspool dweller like Michael Mann is seen as a shining light of Enlightenment.  Give me a f'ing break.  And to give us all a break from the nausea created by these scientific hacks I give you the esteemed Matt Ridley.\n\n\"As somebody who has championed science all his career, carrying a lot of water for the profession against its critics on many issues, I am losing faith. Recent examples of bias and corruption in science are bad enough. What's worse is the reluctance of scientific leaders to criticize the bad apples. Science as a philosophy is in good health; science as an institution increasingly stinks.\n\nThe Nuffield Council on Bioethics published a report last week that found evidence of scientists increasingly \"employing less rigorous research methods\" in response to funding pressures. A 2009 survey found that almost 2 per cent of scientists admitting that they have fabricated results; 14 per cent say that their colleagues have done so.\"\n\n\"Last week, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a supposedly scientific body, issued a press release stating that this is likely to be the warmest year in a century or more, based on surface temperatures. Yet this predicted record would be only one hundredth of a degree above 2010 and two hundredths of a degree above 2005 — with an error range of one tenth of a degree. True scientists would have said: this year is unlikely to be significantly warmer than 2010 or 2005 and left it at that.\n\nIn any case, the year is not over, so why the announcement now? Oh yes, there's a political climate summit in Lima this week. The scientists of WMO allowed themselves to be used politically. Not that they were reluctant.  To squeeze and cajole the data until they just crossed the line, the WMO “reanalysed” a merger of five data sets. Maybe that was legitimate but, given how the institutions that gather temperature data have twice this year been caught red-handed making poorly justified adjustments to “homogenize” and “in-fill” thermometer records in such a way as to cool down old records and warm up new ones, I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"When a similar scandal blew up in 2009 over the hiding of inconvenient data that appeared to discredit the validity of proxies for past global temperatures based on tree rings (part of \"Climategate\"), the scientific establishment closed ranks and tried to pretend it did not matter. Last week a further installment of that story came to light, showing that yet more inconvenient data (which discredit bristlecone pine tree rings as temperature proxies) had emerged.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of scientists do excellent, objective work, following the evidence wherever it leads. Science remains (in my view) our most treasured cultural achievement, bar none. Most of its astonishing insights into life, the universe and everything are beyond reproach and beyond compare. All the more reason to be less tolerant of those who let their motivated reasoning distort data or the presentation of data. It's hard for champions of science like me to make our case against creationists, homeopaths and other merchants of mysticism if some of those within science also practice pseudo-science.\"\n\nTruly despicable behavior from PhD's in Official Science.  That is, those responsible for communications and journal articles, those who are appointed heads of organizations and those who interface with government.﻿", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Equs Narnd", "channel": "UCDsDbAyzyNW0iR4lYvKuY1A", "votes": "13", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShLJx-7XzSFi1100LG0j2UOzZlk47-AExkLvPpcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Science is an evidence-driven process. When the evidence is overwhelming, however, scientific consensus naturally orients around it.

There is an overwhelming scientific consensus around this fact, because the evidence supporting it is proportionately overwhelming. Similarly, the evidence indicates the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause.

Any decrease in pH constitutes acidification, and any increase in pH constitutes alkalinization. While environments below neutral pH are correctly described as \"acidic\", and those above neutral pH are correctly described as \"alkaline\", it is not correct to say that a decrease in alkalinity is something different from an increase in acidity or vice versa.\n\nOcean acidification describes any adjustment of ocean pH toward the lower end of the pH scale.\n\nAs the oceans absorb more and more carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel consumption, a process correctly described as ocean acidification (i.e., a decrease in alkalinity) occurs. This acidification encourages the formation of carbonate ions, and this subtracts from the availability of calcium carbonate to calcifying species, disrupting their biology and the food chain as a necessary consequence.\n\nOcean acidification means more CO2−3 and HCO3–, which necessarily means less CaCO3, and fewer numbers of those species dependent on it.\n\nhttp://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F\n\nOf course, linking to NOAA--a credible scientific institution--is not likely to elicit either your reading or understanding of factual information, because in your world any source which doesn't align with your views is part of the so-called conspiracy.

The confusion required to think along these lines is just astonishing.\n\nWhen it comes to evolution denial, very little harm comes from that belief alone.

It's not a shame if someone believes in the scam of global warming. And not a shame when they put the big jacket on them so they don't injure themselves during those delusion episodes. When someone disagrees with the fact that the earth is cooling, we call him a denier because their statements are not congruent with what is true.

Which is apt for a movement that is largely religious, that takes a couple of facts and 'reasons' its way to huge stupidities.  Unless you're trained in science or at the very least, familiar with the history of science, I don't blame you, but the type of reasoning you're doing, while seemingly logical, is not applicable in science on the scale you are attempting to do it.  Basically, what is wrong with attempting to use deduction, alone, in science, is that it makes a huge number of assumptions.  One of the worst is that it assumes, 'all things being equal.'  This is science, not syllogism or math.  That is a fundamental mistake.  You cannot take laboratory results for CO2 and transpose those results into how CO2 operates in the atmosphere, where it is subject to countless parameters and effects that are little understood.  Furthermore, CAGW is based on seeing water vapor (this is how it is built into the models, which are the sole source for all the panic and stupidity) as nothing but, as exclusively, a positive feedback.  There is no empirical evidence of this...it is merely assumed.  Huge mistake.  And on it goes.  What you have been sold by the CAGW community of true believers is that this whole issue is extraordinarily simple and that a mere deduction of the form you used can be used to explain everything.  Horseshit!  It is an extremely complex problem of a non linear, close coupled chaotic system that refuses to be reduced to a bumper sticker mentality.  The whole enterprise of the IPCC was wrong headed and bound to lead into dead ends and a 'science' that has made no progress in 30 years despite the billions spent worldwide.See the latest papers on the Lindzen 'iris' effect that offer some confirmation of his theory of how the atmosphere works.\n\"We know not only that CO2 is increasing global temperatures but that it is the exact CO2 that humans have put there.\"  That is breathtakingly stupid.

But just because some PhD wrote a paper that was published in a peer review journal I don't genuflect to it granting it 'truth' based on those two facts.  I actually read the paper and pay attention to what it has to say.  From that, one can form an idea of its truth value.  Do you have any idea how much 'shit' gets published that is junk, that has very little truth value?  Every paper I've read that was given to me as 'proof' of CAGW has turned out to be 1.  Not read or read poorly by the referrer.  2.  Not saying what the referrer thought it was saying and 3. Not one of them offered proof of CAGW.  There is something that stands in for what you and yours do that should throw light on this.  Gavin Schmidt is an 'expert' in Climate, at least some say so.  He's affiliated with both NOOA and NASA.  He, through those institutions, released a press release stating that 2014 was the hottest year evuh!!  This was taken up by the press and touted with great fanfare offering 'proof' of the CAGW meme.  Even if it was the hottest year EVUH! that would NOT constitute PROOF of the CAGW meme.  But I think you and yours take it to be proof which suggests you and yours don't understand science and the notion of proof any better than a dim witted jr HS student in spite of your professed fealty to the principles of science.\nBut it wasn't true and Schmidt was forced to withdraw that statement a few days later.  Any honest scientist, that is, any scientist with a shred of intellectual integrity and any fealty to scientific principles would not have done what Schmidt did.  When you see that the numbers showed a temperature that was 5 times less than the error bar for the measurement, any good scientist would have declared that noise, and either made no statement, or the statement would be, 'our measurements fall below the error bars so we must conclude that the plateau continues.'  But that won't do for a True Believer like Schmidt.  One has an obligation to feed the useful idiots, to push the meme, to fight for the cause, to give fodder to the minions.  Every time I push on you YouTube CAGW warriors, this is what I get.  My skepticism remains intact despite the efforts of faux scientists, and 'experts' like Schmidt simply reinforce that skepticism.\n\n\"you must think somehow the experts around the world are [sic]conspired to lie about AGW.\"\n\nNot at all...as I've said at least a 1000 times, most conspiracy theories reveal a type of intellectual laziness, and make assumptions that are unrealistic about other people's intelligence and their ability to coordinate.  No conspiracy theory required to understand how majorities can form around bad ideas nor to understand that your construction of the idea is sloppy at best.  The takeaway from your construction is that ALL 'experts' agree that not only is the planet getting warmer but that the driver is aCO2 and that the results will be catastrophic.  This is false.  Except to the True Believers.\n\n'how come there is not even one scientific institution on this planet that rejects AGW?'\n\nRejects AGW?  Again, for one who insists you grasp the science your constructions are worse than a Freshman in HS.  That's really sloppy.  AGW.  Anthropogenic Global Warming.  What does that mean?  Do you realize that on a cool spring day if you fart you've just contributed to Global Warming.  How can you doubt that?  But once you accept that do you then go on to say 'everyone accepts AGW?'  Meaning everyone excepts CATASTROPHIC global warming being driven primarily by aCO2?\n\nThere is at least one institution that does reject the idea of  CATASTROPHIC global warming being driven primarily by aCO2 whose leadership tried to put out a statement in support of that notion until the members had the courage to stand up and tell the leadership to knock it off.  Again, you profess a belief in science and yet your thinking is as sloppy as someone who graduates with a degree in Women's Studies.  Have you read the statements of everyone of the scientific institutions on this planet?'  Do you know what they say?  Do you know how that statement was arrived at?  Do you know if they polled their membership?  These statements written by these institutions are not worth the paper they are published on nor the ink used to publish them.\n\nAnd again, people who resort to references to authority are revealing how they process the world more than they are about the reality of that world.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Equs Narnd", "channel": "UCDsDbAyzyNW0iR4lYvKuY1A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShLJx-7XzSFi1100LG0j2UOzZlk47-AExkLvPpcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is about time we realize that our government is not controlled by the people we elect or that the people we elect do not represent us anymore. I could elaborate but i feel in this day in age its pretty obvious who really influences or leaders (central banking interest,,international oil, media conglomerations ..etc) The fact that these types of institutions have some more power over our elected officials and the policy agendas they push makes me uneasy because i know for a fact that they have lie to us before. It is this distrust of our government and its publications such as PBS that makes me weary about believe and backing a climate agenda.

{"cid": "UgjwM8SSw2OK4HgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-9Fjr7-KEKYXuWwo", "text": " @Matthew Linus  You don't get it, do you?\nFirst some facts:\n- Everything radiates black body radiation with a peak in different wavelengths depending on its temperature. Things also absorb energy depending on its albedo. (How much of the incoming radiation that gets reflected)\n- Different things are transparent to different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (light). Water vapor for example lets through most visible light but not that much infra red light.\n- When a planet has an atmosphere energy will be trapped inside the atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect (this is a good thing, since it would be cold and we would die if it didn't)\n- The greenhouse effect can a bit simplified be explained as: When visible light goes through the atmosphere (since it is transparent in the visible spectra) and hits a surface of a planet it gets absorbed heating up the surface. The surface then release energy (cool) due to black body radiation. This black body radiation will usually have its peak in the infrared, and since the atmosphere is not as transparent in the infrared part of the spectrum, the IR-light gets scattered down again and heat up the surface again.  \n- Energy trapped inside the atmosphere will heat the planet. And if more and more gets trapped it will heat up more and more.\n- The worst greenhouse gas is not CO²... Water Vapor contributes a lot more.. That is the reason that our infrared telescopes are placed outside of earths atmosphere. (for example)\n\nSo what is the problem then?\nThe problem is that earth has a lot of water and when water gets heated it becomes water vapor. So the warmer the planet becomes , the more water vapor there will be. And the more water vapor there is, the more the earth heats.\nThis have been quite stable as long as the earth have been able to cool of in a fast enough rate, but if the CO² gets added in to the atmosphere, the stability shifts and and the planet heats faster. At the same time the albedo shifts when the ice (that reflects a lot of the light) melts.\nSo basically it wont be as easy as to \"just get rid of the CO² and everything will be fine again\".\n\nAn example of a planet where the greenhouse effect have went wild is Venus. That atmosphere have become around 100 times as thick as on the earth with a lot of greenhouse gases. I sugest that you think for a while if that atmosphere is something that you would want here on earth.\n\n(This post might be a bit simplified. There is a lot going on with the albedo of clouds for example that might save us, but in general things are BAD!)", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Cyoor", "channel": "UCZ_CsxEIMU5yc_rKZ1AkWmA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSwlKr1pQvPdKZn7sG7vC2spEmM3UdEUblS3HXD=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjQ42vrWDEGd3gCoAEC", "text": "I'll talk off my elbows for a second here, and suggest that what we need to do is to find a way to shift the whole discussion around the main culprit for climate change. I suggest:\n\nFor us to stop trying to yank people off their addiction to fossil fuels and instead, find ways to make them addicted to renewable energies.\n\nBecause I think that we're trying to replace fossil fuels for the wrong kind of reasons...\n\nRight now, any new source of non-fossil energy presents itself as either a solution to climate change, or as a handy replacement for when fossil fuel reserves run out.\nThis wind turbine can replace this coal plant! With this electric car you replace that gas car! With this solar panel you don't need to worry about the sun running out soon! And so on.\n\nBut are these the right arguments one should make to convince people to leave fossil fuels?\nAren't we dreaming a little too small with those ideas?\nBecause by continuously framing things like this, renewable energies keep looking, at best, like a replacement for fossil fuels, and at worst, as an inefficient but necessary replacement for them. Something that we have to use we like it or not.\nAnd so the solar panel/wind turbine/whatevs looks expensive, primitive, and as enjoyable as brushing your teeth or going to the doctor. It looks like \"a backup\", a desperate solution, a resource you will be forced to use for when everything else fails.\n\nAnd that's no way to sell the future to people.\n\nSo let us imagine, just for a moment, and just for the sake of argument, that renewable energy had been presented to us, not as a \"replacement\" for fossil fuels, not as a way to \"save the planet\" or \"fight climate change\", but rather, as an improvement beyond our good' ol gas engines.\nImagine if we thought of it as methods to obtain energy (and therefore, to get shit done) that not only does what fossil fuels do right now, but which can do even more than they could ever dream of.\nAnd before you slam me about how renewable energies are \"not there yet\", let me tell you the kicker:\nWe've already done this.\nThere was a time when a new kind of technology appeared which depended on unreliable sources of energy, which was expensive and technical and which was barely able to do what your old technology did with ease. Yet it became the default source of energy for centuries:\n\nFossil fuels.\n\nPeople didn't replaced farm animals for machinery because machinery was \"necessary\" or good for the environment. People didn't began using cars instead of horses because horses were a \"bad habit\" or because cars were \"saving the world\". People switched to fossil fuels in the first place because they were better. Because they allowed you to build, move and produce faster, bigger, and on a scale unimaginable at the time.\n\nAnd I think we're missing the same kind of opportunity here.\nSo forget about how renewable energy competes with gas or coal, forget about how expensive or technical it is in comparison to what you're used to, forget the initial investments or the mountains of research still to be done. These were all the same kind of problems people had to deal with when selling gas or coal engines in the first place. And they won by framing it like this:\nWhat do the new source of energy does that the old one cannot do? What does it allows you to do as a person, or as a society, that you were unable to do before?\nWhat do renewable energies posses that will make fossil fuels looks not only obsolete, but barbaric?\n\nFind THAT pitch, find that unfair advantage in renewable energy, and you can finally stop selling it like the backup or compensation prize that it feels like right now.\nFind the unique characteristic that differentiates it from the rest. Stop competing with the old one, change the discussion and give people something they didn't know they needed before.\nAnd as a bonus, we get to the save the planet.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Arturo Gutierrez", "channel": "UC1Ifd5eyJb4QRRDkOv4AR2g", "votes": "65", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ_yzh3dk3nVd86RX7I32SfjUhqEWYvniZso4NdzOU=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UghGhXyvGPsGKHgCoAEC", "text": "I resisted my urge to unsubscribe, and decided instead to air some of my thoughts on the matter.  I am not looking the argue the merits of global climate change as a done deal, just show why someone like me doesn't care much about it.  I pasted the following from the notepad in which I wrote it. It was not proof-read. I didn't want to find myself re-wording and re-toning what came off the top of my head:\n\n\nHmm, why do people have trouble with the facts about climate change? Let's see, since the 1970s I have heard these predictions presented as though they were a fact. To name just a few:\n\n1) We will be in the next ice age within 20 years (1970-72 global freezing)\n2) The human population is now unsustainable, starvation will kill off most of our population in the next 20 years (around 1974)\n3) \"The oceans will be dead in 20 years\" (Ted Dansen psa around 1990)\n4) We will flat run out of oil in 10 years (around 1972 during the gas rationing crunch)\n\nThere are many others I haven't listed. Much of it fueled by the same human drive for recognition many people yearn to have, and a driving need for the media to be the first with bad news. And credibility in the global climate area of science has suffered to an embarassing degree. Right now, it sucks.\n\nI love science. I enjoy reading layman's books by physicist and cosmologist, even geologist. I favorite all-time book on science is \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson, a non-scientist but exacting author. In spite of that, I find the global weather alarmist community suspect.\n\nConsensus means squat. It used to be a concensus that black holes were black, emitting nothing. It was a consensus that the universal expansion was slowing due to gravitational effects.  That there were four dimensions, one universe, or that the UCLA Bruins basketball team could never lose.  Consensus changes as facts continue to accrue. Global climatologist keep jumping the gun with pronouncements that don't come true.\n\nAl Gore writes a book for profit on the subject, then helps design and carbon credit system to primarily make him richer.  People gripe about it from the comfort of their air-conditioned houses, on their electric-powered computers and global internet system.  They drive their cars, mow their lawns, consume whatever they want, and yelp that someone needs to do something.  The global weather science is caught on email fudging facts to keep the worry factor high (nothing to do with chasing grant money I suppose). Even the term \"global warming\" had to be replaced with climate change to give more room for error.\n\nYes, climate change may be coming more rapidly than ever before, but what are you personally going do about it?  High human population is the problem, right?  Are you going to give up all your conveniences and live down on a subsistence farm?  Are you going to demand that wealthy politicians do the same?  Will you eat at a near starvation level? Never drive an internal combustion vehicle again? Give up all plastics and other oil-derived products? Or any of the endless other self-depriving solutions?\n\nWill you volunteer to give up your life to reduce the over-population?\n\nI personally won't change my ways, but I really don't care about the potential problem. My life is nearing the end and it won't really affect me.\n\nIs it even a solvable problem?  The human race has reach the current level of success by cleverly manipulating the evironment for it's own betterment.  At first it was a survival trait that helped make the species more persistent than it's competitors. Eventually that trait has become the drive to comfort.  Can we change to dump this behavioral trait? Is it genetically hard-wired into our behavior overall?  Maybe, just maybe, we should start considering the possibility that the human species, like all other species, has a limited life span too.

Neither treated like an idiot, or have someone speak with such a thick dialect of science (that is a dialect, try reading their papers on university level, makes no sense to mere mortals). But... I need more data, to do anything about it though...\n\nIt would be nice to know if I eat 300 grams of beef (if there is a significant difference between countries/regions of origin, then put all the data and make it easy to search), or used one kWh of power made from coal and other sources (so I can make a localised calculation), or used 1 litre of petrol in my car, how does that translate into warmer temperatures? And this has to include production released gasses as well (example: refining oil to petrol and the chemicals etc. there are used to get the oil out of the ground).\n\nI know this might be 10^-X kelvin (where X is maybe around 15-20?) crazy small stuff, but if I am ever going to change any pattern in my life until I have data to do cost benefit analysis with. No one ever just gives up everything bad, but most will make concessions based on informed non-forcefull options.\n\nAlso there needs to be more information on indirect sources of green house gas emissions. A random example (that might not have anything to do with reality): If I buy beef from Brazil, what are the impacts of supporting Brazilian agriculture, on driving people to turn the rainforest into farmland, since the rainforest eats CO2...\n\nThe only way to do anything about green house gasses is to inform consumers in a non-emotional way with data. If 2 products are equally good for the same job, but one hurts the environment more, then only an idiot would buy the product that does most harm, but the data and meta-data on this that I can find, is either useless or written in a dialect of science that no non-scientist would ever be able to read.\n\nDriving a car full of people can often be better for the environment than using public transportation. But 1-3 people driving is a lot worse than public transportation (depending on the car). Hybrids are often challenged to meat more challenging requirements, which means they are far from always the solution.\n\nWe need to stop this good-and-bad-for-the-environment argument and tell people exactly how bad something is. Even if it take 10 years before it makes sense to them. Getting people to care is a long and slow process, and has to be done respectfully based on presenting useful and relevant data and not emotions (if you were emotionally invested in this, then you would already be convinced).\n\nThe value of something in raised temperature is something we need to introduce or nothing will ever really change.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "bloodlazio", "channel": "UCY07VStV_qcSEFZVl4lrmgA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLReUCtYD1f3Tm__3JspsRdjo5IwK52R671IrIkO=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I don't know if they were exactly 400% more expensive than a farm animal or a group of people pushing things together (the alternatives at the time); but I'm willing to bet early engines were, adding all the complications of these early prototypes, very, very expensive for the \"little\" work they could do in comparison to proven muscle-technologies of the time.\n\nRight now we complain about how you need hectares of solar cells or wind turbines to replace a single gas generator, but such kind of complain reminds me of those days when people complained that you needed gas stations, roads, training and mechanical skills to own a car.\nNo new technology begins as efficient as the previous one. None. But they all hold something that the previous one lacked and which people required at the time. Cheapness and efficiency come later, not first.\n\nSo what is that \"special something\" about renewable energies? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there isn't any. Or maybe there is and the time is simply not right yet for us to see how glaringly obvious it had been all along.\n  \nBut all and all, I find it it erroneous to think that renewables can compete with fossil fuels on a one-to-one match. They shouldn't even try to.

I would argue that we are already trying to convince people the correct way; the primary source of false information is from news outlets. The reason this false information is continually being spread is due to a combination of confirmation bias and funding directly or indirectly from companies that have interests in fossil fuels. In many cases, there are unfounded and heavily biased attacks from all sorts of media on groups revolving around renewables. In addition, it seems that conservatives in the US are more politically oriented against climate change, which gives them a reason to fight against it, since people are willing to choose and support almost everything one of the only two available parties in the US. I believe this is because people are treating political parties like teams, and they would like the opposing team to loose, rather than for the correct action to be taken.\n\nI like your analysis, but there are few people that would be dissuaded from their opinion from just explaining those things. Often times I find that after convincing somebody that climate change exists or that the advancement of renewables should be supported and funded by government, some time later they will completely forget and switch back to the opposing stance.

Of course, it'll still trend upwards, but if we slow the trend we'll do less damage in the long run.\n\nWe also need to push for upgrades in automobile fuel efficiency. Ultimately we need to get off of petroleum for automobiles, but in the short term adopting diesel engines and pushing fuel efficiency will reduce our impact.\n\nWe need to implement better land use ideas, including better management of grazing land so that the grassland's ability to absorb carbon isn't compromised.

{"cid": "UghzcZa9n7n2OHgCoAEC", "text": "This didn't change my mind. It failed in a few ways (though I'm still a fan of the show as a whole!)\n\nCorrelation is not causation. Causation has not been proven, only correlation, but even then it has been 1400 years, according to this video, since the Arctic was so small. Were human beings burning fossil fuels then? No. Did the Earth (and humanity) recover? Yes. Was the world hotter 65m years ago in the reign of the dinosaurs? Yes. Were there significantly higher levels of CO2 then? Yes. CO2 is required to make plants grow. Animals were bigger then due to this, and the vegetation was lush. Eventually, the earth cooled, and many species died, but that is the course of the circle of life. Did humans cause the Earth the dinosaurs inhabited to be so hot with so much CO2 by consuming fossil fuels? I really don't think so.\n\nThe Earth will always be here. Species come and go as this occurs. Survival of the most adaptable. The earth goes through changes. Something I did find interesting in this video was the argument about the Sun not warming the uppermost layer of the atmosphere, and it being the lower layers getting warmer (where CO2 might accumulate). That is some intriguing information. Yet this video fails to address other planets in our solar system also getting hotter, and some scientists attribute that to the sun. Whether they're correct in that attribution is irrelevant -- sun activity is diminishing afterall -- but the fact remains that they are also getting hotter. Are humans burning fossil fuels on Earth causing that?\n\nThere's as much evidence for climate science as against. Climategate was a big deal. People did lie, for financial incentives and with political motivations. To chide \"conspiracy theorists\" and make fun of them early in the video, while funny, is a bit immature, not to mention an extreme display of sophistry. I understand YouTube videos need to be short, but the shortcut of telling us global warming evidence is overwhelming rather than proving it is lazy. Making a statement is not proving a statement. Then making fun of real people with real reasons for their real beliefs... that's low. Sophistry is not fact. It's just sophistry.\n\nIn short, this video suffers from: causation != correlation; sophistry; straw man fallacy; and many other logical, rhetorical, and philosophical blunders. If you're going to attack people, risking isolating a portion of your fan base, at least wear your big boy panties.\n\nIn the end, even if global warming supporters are 100% correct, we are not saving the planet. The planet will still be here, will adapt, change, and grow, whether we're here to witness it or not. This is all about saving humanity, selfish motivations out the wazoo. Carbon taxes... hmm... that seems like a great idea to reduce pollution. Money will certainly clean our air... wait, no it won't. Throwing money at a problem won't fix it. All the money in the world won't protect us from global warming (if it's true). At best, a carbon tax solution as proposed at present reduced the number of people consuming fossil fuels to only those who can afford it. That rate is adjustable, and thus the number of people at any given time consuming fuel is adjustable as well. This is not conspiracytardedness but rather an honest analysis of a proposed policy. But if only a small percent of the rich elite have access to fossil fuels... what happens to the rest of us in today's modern world, especially those of us in suburbs or rural communities?", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Polygon Gaming", "channel": "UCgcSzlSQrL2rcGQUd5cyaYQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLStjfi6kFmI83RM0kc0xQZNEsazNMtYvJNB_iv_jw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There are a host of problems with the ice-core that can lead to the ice-core misrepresenting past CO2 levels such as fractionation processes like gravitational compression which can force CO2 up to the surface, the formation of clathrates which explode like tiny grenades when the ice-core is decompressed which create micro-cracks that can potentially taint the original air, different solubility coefficients of gases with CO2 being absorbed by frozen water in the ice-bubbles at a disproportionately greater rate than other gases, and measurements that have been inappropriately adjusted after the fact. The original ice-core measurements from the likes of Neftel 1982 showed CO2 as high as 500ppmv but these measurements were later arbitrarily deleted from the recorded as explained by Jaworowski presumably as to align with Callendar's interpretation. Other paleo-climate data such as stomata shows that atmospheric CO2 is highly variable over millennia and is not 'static' as the ice-core suggests but varies continually in accordance with a host of environmental parameters such as temperature and biomass. Stomata shows CO2 as high as 459ppmv. Also we have over 90,000 chemical measurements complied by Georg Beck showing CO2 reaching 440ppmv as far back as 1880 and these direct CO2 measurements correlate nicely with changes in temperature as would be expected with Henry's law. I am not meaning to suggest that the ice-core data is useless, but I think it would be unwise as to interpret it as a reliable representation of past CO2 levels, especially when it is in direct conflict with other data and has obvious flaws.\n\nThis video has been uploaded by people who have not really investigated this subject thoroughly and are just mindlessly parroting the same old fashionable memes it seems to me.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "CHIP", "channel": "UCTZh9kDZ9wdFLBM-1EYom0A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTH4U91dOBIHLTVi9HZxfA3opSeLRhKn8BumeFbvA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Human activity has an effect on climate, most assuredly. \n\nHowever...\n\nTalking about the consequences 100 years in the future is pure nonsense. Such predictions assume \"if this goes on\", and the one thing we know absolutely is that things do not go on without changing. With the rest of the world industrializing, the price of fossil fuels is going to be rising, and rising a lot; that is basic supply and demand. As those prices rise, alternative energy becomes price competitive. It is already the case that a homeowner in the US will save money by installing a solar system for electricity. As people switch to those alternatives, economies of scale kick in which make them even less expensive. Technology improvements compound this effect. It is highly likely that within 20 years, solar power and other alternatives will be SO much cheaper than coal, that nobody will be using fossil fuels for much more than plastics. And that puts to bed the scaremongering of what will happen in 100 years.\n\nOcean iron fertilization could quite easily pull the excess carbon out of the atmosphere and convert it to marine life, not incidentally also thereby reversing the acidification. Concerns about resulting harmful algal blooms can be mitigated by not concentrating the iron fertilization but dispersing it much more, drone balloons lightly dispersing atmospherically for instance.\n\nCloud seeding could easily reverse any short term warming spikes... Etc..\n\nThe problem with the global warming enthusiasts that the deniers rebel against is that the issue has been largely hijacked by people with a political agenda that runs counter to what they hold quite dear. Their reaction is motivated by the emotion that engenders. The global warming enthusiasts exhort that we must restrain human ambition, that we must curtail the industrialization of the third world and roll back our own, that in essence we must grant the state even greater power to impoverish us. Given that their reaction is emotional, it is not surprising that often their statements are irrational. But portraying them as solely tin foil hat loons to be mocked, as does this video, is frankly insulting.\n\nThe ecology lobby does NOT have the last word, they do NOT have the right answers, there IS another side to all this.\n\nWhat should we do? We should invest in the science of things like cloud seeding and ocean iron fertilization, which right now is being actively opposed by those very ecologists who are sounding the alarm bells (remember what I said about a political agenda). We should be spending at least as much pushing the R&D of energy alternatives as we are spending doing military R&D. The budget for E-ARPA is less than 10% of that of DARPA. Bumping E-ARPA to DARPA levels would cost less than what we spend on peanut butter, and would have vastly more effect on the future than global carbon taxes or attempts at legislating industrial curtailment.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Peter Cohen", "channel": "UCKEhxqcM57tWV83m_OAdYLg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSlHKhTZn6W8gVpVRmearTLTtlWGwRDuOkcw20a=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We do indeed observe tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, but it's not because greenhouse gases are confined to the lower atmosphere. For a well-mixed gas like CO2, the mixing ratios are fairly uniform with height up into the stratosphere (of course the total number of molecules in a volume goes down, just like with any other gas, because density goes down with height). But CO2 is increasing aloft as well. Because of this, the upper layers become more efficient at emitting energy to space, while receiving less infrared flux from lower down, where absorption is going up.

The increased acidity is dissolving the shells of animals that need calcium. We know this is a problem, but people dont seem to like it because it wont directly effect them. People* are lazy and only want to do something if it directly benefits them. Sadly, not drowning to death, or starving, are succumbing to tropical diseases in a temperate area of the world dont count as direct benefits.\n\nThe main reason why scientist say: \"this and that could supposedly happen...\" is because we are charting unexplored areas. We dont know what is going to happen, but pretty much 100% of our scientists, the best and brightest of humanity, agree that it isn't going to end well if we do nothing.\n\nNo, I dont like fear mongering. But we should be afraid of this very real and very direct threat. I could tell you of all the things that could happen. But from a strictly scientifically point, I would have to claim it as a possibility and not a certainty, even if it is very likely.\nBut I can tell you, it won't end well if we keep going on.\n\nI myself was very skeptical of the imminence of the danger. It was only until last September when we started investigating the oceans for our Geochemical Cycles course that the facts really started to sink in. Our whole class, usually a very joyful and friendly bunch, couldn't and cant stop talking about it.\nLearning of the importance of the oceans was, for me, the turning point. And I am still trying to find words to best emphasize their importance.\n\nPS: sorry it got a little long, really just find it important to explain this.\n\n\n*: I am describing an average behavior of people, not a specific one for everybody.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Azivegu", "channel": "UCzoAMj8oJuwxqE2LRo3Vh6g", "votes": "32", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR9qeYkfd1eHyiQtIKTDSzQBOdiufGxoJbmlXNy=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I revised my text like three times to make sure it was understandable to someone who isnt in geology xD.\nThe real concern for me is the stability of gas methane hydrates (GMH) in ocean sediments. It only takes a slight  temperature change to make the crystal unstable and dissolve. There are two lighter sides (if you look at it in a very obscure way): the rising temperatures wont affect deep or intermediate ocean right away of course. So that could give us an extra 100 to 500 years. And the increase of sea level increases the pressure too.\nThat not so fun side is that basically the USGS has done (ballpark estimate) 80% of the research on GMH's. When we made a Stella Model, we didnt have good numbers for anything.\nWhen we tried to calculate the production of GMH there was only 1 article that we could find that gave us something we could use. And even that was with a wide margin.\n(for the article, look for: F. S. Colwell, S. Boyd, M. E. Delwiche, D. W. Reed, T. J. Phelps and D. T. Newby, “Estimates of Biogenic Methane Production Rates in Deep Marine Sediments at Hydrate Ridge, Cascadia Margin” Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008, 74(11):3444. DOI: 10.1128/AEM.02114-07.)\n\nBut killing of 8 billion people would be hard. But loss of coastal lands, degraded farming (droughts, flooding, soil depletion, saltification), ocean dead zones and acidification increased temps, water scarcity and go on and on. We are seeing deaths from climate stress (climate factors and social unrest due to climate) which could probably kill off 70 to 90% of humanity (again, a ballpark estimate). Wouldnt be everything, but it wouldnt be hard to end human life on earth. We will probably be hit by an asteroid we where no longer looking for. That would be a kind of dark humor.\n\nMy real concern is that we just dont know enough, and that when we do, it will be too late. Maybe a bit outdated, but if I where to have kids, I don't want them to live in an Interstelleresque kind of world, where starving to death, or the black lung are legitimate causes of death.\n\nPS: Also maybe important, I am in my second year of Earth Sciences.

I must say that is completely false. I study aerospace engineering, specifically astronautics. One of the many scientific reasons why the world has not returned a human to the moon or elsewhere since 1972 is primarily due to both solar and cosmic radiation. In fact, Apollo 16 just missed a coronal mass ejection when they returned to Earth. The Apollo astronauts were lucky, plain and simple. The entire surface of Mars (once similar to Earth, with flowing water) has been BLEACHED by these charged atomic particles traveling at light speeds over billions of years due to Mars' lack of a magnetic field (unlike Earth). Can you imagine what this constant stream of particles would do to tissue and DNA, when we are pondering an indefinite lunar base? The ISS (although still shielded by Earth's magnetic field) has been such an asset in the testing of new technologies and materials that would protect astronauts for future long-term deep space voyages. However, there is still no current technology that can positively shield astronauts from cosmic radiation, and this is one of the primary reasons NASA refuses to send more manned moon or Mars missions in the near future. \n\n\nThis is but one of the MANY concerns regarding long term space missions, let alone indefinite. While water has in fact been found on the moon, it is so minute that it would take enormous effort to harvest enough to sustain a permanent human foothold. You also have to find a way to get around the enormous lack of gravity when compared to Earth. Our bodies are designed for Earth, that is to a specific pressure and force being exerted from all angles. When you are in space or on any other surface with anything but EARTH's specific gravity, your bones and tissue will deteriorate! This is why any proposed deep space mission must CREATE artificial gravity (such as Mars Direct). What about food? What about healthcare? Wouldn't you want some sort of entertainment on the moon if you are living there forever, to prevent insanity? \n\n\nBottom line. We aren't ready for manned long-term deep space voyages. There are just too many risks and dangers associated with it. However, will we be in the future?

Then there are the countless peoples who have been wiped out by war (internally or with neighbours). We humans cull our numbers expertly. More interestingly and to the point, humanity as a whole seems to have nearly vanished due to famine roughly 150,000 years ago. If our numbers are sufficiently reduced it won’t matter whether or not the entire planet is inhospitable to us (which was the initial point I was making). \n\nAs you’ve noted, rising sea levels could definitely become a problem for humans. But if a large enough portion of humanity were wiped out due to an inability to cope with extreme weather (plus famine and civil instability/violence), then you’re right, the remaining humans could easily move inland with other populations there. However, massive influxes of refugees is a bit of a hard thing to deal with in the best of times. Some projections put the number of displaced people as high as 1 billion due to sea rise. There will be no accommodating that many migrants. \n\nAgain, I’m not saying I think humanity is screwed. Effects of climate change can be mitigated, and there are still many variables that we do not fully have a handle on. Our current level of technology and social organization is unprecedented and this could be enough to save us. But I think it’s a dangerous hubris to ever dismiss the possibility of humans going extinct.\n\nI found this section on the wikipedia page on Human Extinction to be interesting: “wiki/Human_extinction#Observations_about_human_extinction” \nAnd you may be interested in the wiki page on “Societal Collapse.”\n\nNext week: Asteroidal impacts and super volcanoes!", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Centregeist", "channel": "UCy-0WYyNj6LZdPX1lcvyN-w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSrLDDBLJnGJ-M7N9WNQVOYDtt8Gpbxn_6N2By7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I later stated that its hubris to think humans won't go extinct and noted that this has already almost happened.\n\nI do agree with you that our large and wide-ranging population is a huge factor in our survivability. This point falls right in line with the unprecedented levels of technology and social order that I mentioned.\n\nRegarding rising sea levels I never implied a situation of masses of screaming people racing away from 100m waves or anything. Crumbling infrastructure and social disorder would lead to the migration. Of course the sea level isn't going to rapidly shoot up over night. But imagine more situations like Hurricane Katrina with even less social support. Repeated cases of that will definitely unsettle things. And yes, increase in severe weather is an anticipated outcome of climate change.\n\nI should mention that I had to learn about disaster mitigation and climate change in courses at my university as part of a program in public planning.

You have to evaporate off the water and then rapidly cool it as it ascends in order to get cloud formation. The types of clouds you get are affected by a number of different variables, most of which I no longer remember but that's digressing.\n\nThe bigger issue is, water vapor is ALSO a potent green-house gas. So you pump CO2 into the air which traps more heat. This increased heat generates more water vapor through evaporation. This increase in water vapor in the air traps even more heat. And you cannot guarantee cloud formation from it.\n\nSo I see what you were hoping for, but it doesn't necessarily pan out. We asked that same question of our climate science teacher, so it was a good guess!\n\nAnd as to your last part, the fact of the matter is that CO2 is what we have the most control over.

Cycling carbon doesn't cause AGW.

Production models that lead to soil degradation are the problem, not the consumer eating the food. Change the production model and restore the soil carbon and you can actually eat your way to mitigating AGW. In fact since it is scientifically proven that increasing soil organic matter increases agricultural productivity, you could even support more people eating even more food.

I have researched core samples oxygen isotope records on both poles and seen the frequencies of 18oxygen isotope to 16base oxygen. I have assisted with paleoclimate analysis of hard shell calcium carbonate temperature sensitive marine organisms. I have reviewed probably over a hundred papers on various proxy climate records. For my undergraduate thesis I analyzed tree rings and C14 analysis in sedimentation of vast bodies of preserved prehistoric organisms.

They don't discuss flaws in ground system thermometers or how we analyzing a system so complex that we can't even monitor reliability through our mounts of ignorance.

{"cid": "UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8BVlGVmcA-q", "text": "The proof that man-made CO2 is causing global warming is like the chain of evidence in a court case. CO2 keeps the Earth warmer than it would be without it. Humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere, mainly by burning fossil fuels. But maybe as importantly, by degrading the ecosystems responsible for returning that CO2 back into the earth/soil. And there is empirical evidence that the rising temperatures are being caused by the increased CO2. \n\nOne way of measuring the effect of CO2 is by using satellites to compare how much energy is arriving from the sun, and how much is leaving the Earth. What scientists have seen over the last few decades is a gradual decrease in the amount of energy being re-radiated back into space. In the same period, the amount of energy arriving from the sun has not changed very much at all. This is the first piece of evidence: more energy is remaining in the atmosphere and/or being reflected back..\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GL048794/abstract\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf\n\nFor our next piece of evidence, we must look at the amount of CO2 in the air. We know from bubbles of air trapped in ice cores that before the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the air was approximately 280 parts per million (ppm). In June 2013, the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory in Hawaii announced that, for the first time in thousands of years, the amount of CO2 in the air had gone up to 400ppm.\nhttp://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/gr.html\nhttp://www.climatecentral.org/news/co2-400-ppm-global-17485\n\nNow that is pretty secure, because it is directly measurable. CO2 is rising, and the Earth is retaining more heat from the sun than emitting. However, while the basics are secure, there is some room for debate as to why. Obviously CO2 emissions are coming from fossil fuel emissions and a few other things.But that's happened before. Why wouldn't the plants just suck it right back out. After all increasing CO2 generally makes plants grow a bit faster. That's more complicated. See about 40% of the planet land surface is affected by agriculture. Most the \"prime agricultural\" land is already in production. So to understand why the ecosystems that typically would have sucked that CO2 right back out, we really need to study agriculture. For example, we know the great tallgrass prairie of North America no longer exists at all. ~98% destroyed, mostly to grow corn and soy. Similar situations can be found all over the globe. So how does this effect climate? Well, the answer is, it depends really. First you lose the natural ecosystem function, then you add the artificial agricultural ecosystem that replaces it, and compare. In some cases certain agricultural practises might improve carbon sequestration over the natural ecosystems they replaced, but as a general rule MOST agriculture has been done in such a way as to reduce the carbon sequestration potential of the land. Even cutting emissions to 0 wouldn't work because the sinks are damaged.\nhttp://blogs.uoregon.edu/gregr/files/2013/07/grasslandscooling-nhslkh.pdf\nhttp://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1209_051209_crops_map.html\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/\nhttp://www.grazingbestprac.com.au/research/grazing/AGEE3851%20Grazing%20management%20impacts%20in%20north%20Texas%20v12011.pdf\nhttp://sri.cals.cornell.edu/conferences/IRC2014/booth/SRI_climate_smart_rice_production_%20handout_2014.pdf\nhttp://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/1261\n\nSo while the issue really is a complex one, a few things are immediately obvious. 1) We are burning fossil fuels which adds to atmospheric CO2. 2) We have largely destroyed the most productive ecosystems on the land surface which are carbon sinks, and replaced them with artificial agricultural ecosystems that function much differently, usually reducing the carbon sink potential. 3)There are alternative artificial agricultural system that can function as sinks, even bigger sinks than natural ecosystems.\n\nSo if currently we are adding CO2, and reducing the amount of the CO2 sink, but we know how to increase the sink, why aren't we doing that? Why the ultra leftist campaign against fossil fuels when we have a solution to the extra fossil fuel emissions already? (change agriculture to a bigger sink than even the natural ecosystems they replaced)\n\nDenialism gets you nowhere but planet earth on slow boil. But you don't have to submit to the extreme leftists either. Impossible for their solutions to work anyway. The only real solution that saves civilization is change agriculture.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Red Baron Farm", "channel": "UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSQSUdRIaklCsGhkM-VKq5Wsvh1Y1uErSPFVmYN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

CO2, water vapor, methane - it is trivial to verify, personally, that these are indeed greenhouse gasses - so trivial a child could put together an experiment that proves it. It is also trivial to understand how our use of fossil fuels correlates to an increase in atmospheric CO2 when you come to understand combustion products - another 3rd grade science topic. When you burn something containing carbon, you oxidize it - and that carbon has to go somewhere. Since there's none left in the remaining ash, it must have escaped in the form of gas.

This is well within natural variability. I think the issue with where I am sitting is that I am submerged in research. I am aware of the uncertainties in research. For many people who aren't scientists or haven't conducted research, they often look at scientists and their papers as factual. The thing is, it isn't and that is my whole point. I don't believe in the factual basis that is being thrown around right now. You either believe that our industrial by-products are the leading cause of the current climate variability or you are a baboon. This case is absurd. \n\nI don't even know where to begin because it is extremely hard for me to believe data. You can link me a heavily cited ice core record paper and I will at it and see -70/+70y variability with spill over (that can't be accounted for in data variability analysis). You can link me a geochemical analysis of surface water levels in Australia and I will see concentration bias via secondary factors that were not looked at (because of funding publication e.g. deep sea gas expulsion). You can link me a chart on carbon ratio concentrations in lower atmosphere which points to an archaic atmosphere and I won't even care. Because a) so what? b) this proves nothing & c) what is the chemistry of a notch higher atmosphere and why wasn't this accounted for? \n\nHeck you could link me a paper on glacial melt and I will ask a) why is glaciers growing (on average) b) why would their breaking have to do with temperature vs surface area pressure & c) if they are breaking because of temperature i) how do you know this ii) show me your experiment iii) how do you know the heating was due to human activity? \n\nMy point being, as a skeptic and as an objective scientist I don't like interpretation.Singularities are my game. So when I see climatologists who smooth graphs and make strong conclusions based on their data..I have to do a face palm. But it is even stupider as they win awards, get more grant money and policy is built on their research. Let me tell you, geometric secular variation in ionosphere storm nucleation..not as pretty sounding as \"humans are fucking up the earth, eh.\" But anyways, my point is..I am skeptical and when you ask me for \"evidence\" of human activity not causing the currently climate well......my evidence is my skeptical opinion based on issues with conclusions of the scientists own lab data", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "TheChemist", "channel": "UCq_IBy6lIaXusi1Y_UEhOyg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbGFkAEajklGX-1O4WFdEj9oKthYiOpKXagsNo6A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8S7kNHK9QM0", "text": "+W. Hoffman\n\n\"1.  Do you think there's no way a poll could yield such results without bias?\"\n\nYup. Just like a poll could yield a 99% consensus on human evolution among PhD, research biomedical scientists. For example:\n\nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/an-elaboration-of-aaas-scientists-views/\n\nThis is because experts in a scientific field are more likely to know about evidence in that field, how to reason in that field, etc. So if there's solid evidence in that field, a consensus will usually form among the experts. This consensus might not extend to non-experts, since the non-experts are more likely to be ignorant of the science, not understand how to reason about that scientific field, etc. That point applies to evolutionary biology just as it applies to climate science.\n\n\n\n\"2.  If it were truly 97%, could you not imagine the questions were framed to leave no chance?\"\n\nThe results have been replicated by independent research groups, using different questions framings. You'd know this if you bothered to read any of the sources I've been citing to you for months. This is shown in:\n\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\nFigures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of \"The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016\"\nhttps://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf\n\nThe ~90% consensus attributing recent global warming to humans, as shown on page 49 of:\n\"Model, manifestation and attribution of climate change\"\n\n\n\n\"3.  Aren't you the least bit suspicious of a survey of \"climate scientists\" whose livelihood depends on their beliefs?\"\n\nNo, because that's just a silly, paranoid conspiracy theory you have. Scientists don't just en masse make up conclusions to match their funding sources. Otherwise, most scientists would have stopped citing evidence of AGW under AGW denialist, politically conservative administrations; yet that didn't happen. And if AGW research was just a money-motivated conspiracy, then you would not expect such as broad scientific consensus to hold across scientists from different political/governmental systems; yet such a consensus did arise:\n\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\nNor would you expect the scientific consensus to be supported by multiple lines of evidence, including from evidence from non-government-funded studies, studies that were done before there was much of a political rationale for funding climate science research, and studies that lack a politically-motivated funding rationale; yet we do have such lines of evidence.\n\nIt also makes no sense to claim that these scientists are just lying for the sake of funding, or because their field depends on it. After all, climate science is an old field (dating back to the 1800s) that includes more than anthropogenic climate change, just like oncology/cancer is a field that includes more than smoking-induced cancer. So scientists can get funding to study non-anthropogenic climate change, just like oncologists can get funding to explore cancer that isn't caused by smoking. Thus, it makes little sense to claim that climate scientists are all lying to prop up their field, just like it makes little sense to claim that doctors are all lying (to prop up their field) when they claim that smoking causes cancer. To claim otherwise, is to show that you ignorantly believe that climate science is just about anthropogenic climate change.\n\nFurthermore, you seem to have little understanding of how grant funding is awarded. It isn't awarded based on researchers guaranteeing that their research will support an accepted, pre-determined consensus conclusion. In fact, the research that gets the most attention, prestigious prizes (ex: Nobel prizes), etc. is research that overturns accepted conclusions or breaks new ground, as opposed to just supporting the consensus position. \n\nGrant proposals may offer hypotheses to test, but the proposals typically leave open the possibility that the hypotheses will not be confirmed and instead a novel conclusion may be supported. For example, they might propose testing one of the predictions of AGW theory. Those sorts of studies are often funded. And they often end up getting evidence that supports the predictions of AGW, even though it wasn't it was always possible for them to have disconfirmed the predictions.\n\nAnyway, grant funding is awarded based on things such as the proposal writers previously publication record (to show that you can do published research, when given money), preliminary data presented in the proposal, how well the proposal writers know the field (as displayed in their grant proposal), whether the proposal writers have access to the equipment/tools needed for their proposed project, etc. You'd know this if you'd ever bothered to apply for a research grant, spoken with scientists who'd applied for such grants, looked up the grant proposal guidelines (which are freely available on the NIH website, NASA website, etc.), or spoken with grant reviewers. I've done all four of these. Trying doing those 4 things some time.\n\n\n\n\"4 [...]\"\n\nYour questions 4 - 6 are silly red herrings based on you not grasping the difference between an evidence-based scientific consensus vs. topics like politics, business, etc.\n\n\n\n\"7.

Sorry, I was in a hurry and wasn't prepared to precisely qualify my position on AGW, especially as I've already done so a few times in this 200-comment-long thread. Alas, no, I don't expect anyone to read through this entire monstrosity, but repeating myself gets tiring,\n\nI still don't understand what you were trying to say with the '2+2 = 4 therefore AGW' thing. It's pretty clear by your tone that you think I'm a moron. Are you suggesting that I'm simply taking the claims I hear at face value without doing some fact checking?\n\nAs for 'keeping the faith' - I don't keep faith. I threw that out a long time ago along with dogma and superstition. Further, I try very hard not to tie my identity to my beliefs, and so generally don't have as difficult a time changing beliefs as others might. This was a difficult skill to acquire, and while I still haven't quite mastered it (I'm only human) I think I do pretty well these not to get upset when my erroneous beliefs are corrected. I try to be open to all the evidence, not just that which comports with my already established views. (Key word: try. It's hard work and echo chambers are just so easy to belong to.) If you've got something to share that add to the discussion, then please share it. \n\nThe science on greenhouse gasses is, as I mentioned earlier in this thread, elementary-school-level. A 3rd grade child could demonstrate the greenhouse effect with a variety of gasses as well as quantify each one's specific contribution - in fact, I along with the rest of my 3rd grade science class back in 1989 did exactly that. (Our control was vacuum - needless to say, the teacher handled that apparatus for us.)\n\nCO2 is not the only greenhouse gas, nor is it (by unit) the most potent. Methane is a really bad one, and water vapor (the most abundant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere) is up there too. I think the reason CO2 is discussed so much is because our contribution to worldwide CO2 levels is massive and easy to notice on a graph. Quantifying global CO2 isn't exactly grade-school science, but it's straightforward and easily understood by your average educated layman. I don't really see any reason to doubt the measurements that have been taken, by multiple independent parties - error bars notwithstanding.\n\nThe thing about climate change is that there is no one cause. Humans play a role, as well as a myriad of other systems in our lovely biosphere. Nothing exists in a vacuum, and everything we do has consequences of some sort.\n\nAs far as the specific consequences of our involvement in mucking with global climate; I'm taking all predictions with the appropriate amount of salt. We are notoriously bad at predicting the behavior of complex systems, and climate is a beast to model with any sort of accuracy. I will say that the general theme - bad times ahead - is probably accurate, although to what degree is anyone's guess.\n\nPersonally, I've been on-board with reducing humanity's carbon footprint long before climate change became a hot-button issue. Fossil fuels are so 19th century. \n\nOh, and - I don't know why, but Youtube flagged your two most recent replies as spam, and is not allowing me to undo that.

Mostly, you are talking about choices we humans may make, and truth be known, I'd rather see o&g reserves used for medicine, building materials, plastics, adhesives and the whole panoply of constructive products they make possible, than simply burning them up.\n\nI also favor moving to a nuclear energy production system, and eventually a fusion-based economy (with hydrogen for transportation).\n\nWhat I won't put up with (and the entire thrust of all my posts on the topic, both here and on my own channel, is based on this) is being bullied by people selling a fear, cloaked in scientific terms.

It is only to suggest that if you consider the foundation of the AGW theory, and find it flawed (which 1+1=2 is not), then everything built on it is fragile, suspect.  Your comment that you did an experiment in 3d grade that showed warming suggests you had some version of Fourier's experiments recreated by your teacher.\nSince this brings the discussion back to science, I'd like to pursue it.  Realizing it was now 28 years ago, I don't suppose you recall the details, but can I ask what it was about it that convinced you that \"anthropogenic global warming\" was well modeled by it?

That kind of behavior harms not only the people who are deceived by it, but the entire scientific enterprise by turning what is supposed to be a tool for discovery and enlightenment into a malicious weapon that serves only greed. If you have some evidence that the current state of the AGW hypothesis is informed by this kind of thinking, then I absolutely want to see that.\n\n\"not meant to suggest you or anyone else is a moron.\" That was kind of a knee-jerk reaction and I apologize; a lot of people like to be rude on the internet, but that doesn't give me license to assume. I understand what you mean now - although I'll remind you that \"1+1=2\" is only axiomatically true, and thus only as solid as the axioms upon which it is laid. =P\n\nI'm not a climate scientist, so I don't know really know whether the AGW hypothesis is flawed or not. I tend to outsource the knowledge-gathering to field experts, and I tend to trust those experts regarding their findings. I think that most people do this, whether they profess a distrust of science in general or not. I'm aware of bias and deception, but I think that most professionals are decent, honest people who are as interested in understanding reality as I am. Optimistic, perhaps, but that's just where I'm at with all this. When I do find evidence of bias or deception, naturally I adjust my internal models appropriately - but I'm not going to preemptively distrust scientists or their findings. I'd be stuck in the dark ages if I did that consistently.\n\nAs far as the details regarding the experiment my science teacher had us perform - alas, no, I don't remember very much at all aside from the results I personally gathered. I'd like to be able to describe the setup in detail, but I only have very vague visual memories from then. It was a long time ago and those memories have been stepped on a lot in the intervening years - but that's what I get for trying to record data into meat and fats. =P I'll do some research into the experiments you mentioned and see if any bells ring.\n\n\"what it was about it that convinced you that \"anthropogenic global warming\" was well modeled by it?\" - Eh, I wouldn't say that. The purpose of the experiment was only to demonstrate and quantify the greenhouse effect on a small scale, not to model climate change. If you're asking me why I'm convinced that AGW is well modeled in general, well I wouldn't say that either. I would say that my level of certainty here is maybe 70%. If I was more directly informed on the topic, I could revise that probability estimate, but alas, there are only so many hours in a day, and I don't really find climate science to be very fulfilling of a field, personally. I'm more into astronomy, chemistry, and physics although I'm not a professional in any of these fields.\n\nAs far as why I think AGW is more likely than not a factor in climate change - well I think I covered that in my previous reply, but I'll restate: nothing lives in a vacuum, and the things we do as a species affect our environment on a global scale. Specifically, the carbon in the fuels we burn at gigaton levels annually has to go somewhere, and since there's none left behind after combustion (ideally), that 'somewhere' can only be the atmosphere. It isn't a very big leap to go from 'CO2 is demonstrated to be a greenhouse gas' to 'increasing the amount of global CO2 in the atmosphere will result in a commensurate increase in the global greenhouse effect.'\n\nTo be clear, I don't think that humans are the only causal factor - far from it - and I'm still unsure just how much impact we really have in the grand scheme of things. Complex systems are difficult to model and predict, and I am pretty much entirely out of my depth when it comes to climate models. But I do trust the experts who we rely on to investigate these things.\n\n\"I ask because sometimes we get shown things, and even by good teachers, the things are wrong...\" - If you're implying that my teacher used this experiment as a comment on climate change, I could be wrong but I don't think this was the case. My memory is pretty foggy here but I don't think climate change was even discussed, or if it was it was more hypothetical than anything else. You are correct, however, in that sometimes well-meaning authorities allow ideological biases to impact their work. We are all human, and nobody is immune to bias. All we can do is correct for our biases when we spot them, as best we can.\n\n\"Do you know why there are high tides on both sides of the earth at the same time?\" - If this was covered in any of my science classes (and it's likely that it was), I don't remember. However, I have seen several differing pop-sci explanations, none of which I can recall the details for at the moment - but this is the kind of factoid that I tend to outsource to google for remembering. I haven't been interested enough in the question to really dig into any of the explanations I've heard to suss out what's true, though. You've got me curious though; where are you going with this? =)\n\n\"Life goes on.\" That it does, that it does.

It's true that the environmental impact of manufacturing green'energy often goes overlooked by green energy advocates, and this is definitely a problem that deserves more scrutiny.\n\nReally, it's the same deal with your second question, just in a different domain, although it seems by the way you phrased your question that you already have a good start on answering it yourself. I will say though that my intuition tells me that unless some electric vehicle manufacturer was being excessively dirty in their process, EVs are probably guaranteed to be cleaner in the long run than their gas burning counterparts - but I don't know how to quantify this.\n\nRegarding your third question: can we ever stop man-made climate change? Yes, I think it's possible, but only if we all collectively leave the planet behind and go find a new environment to live in - and then we'll just start changing that climate, simply because we're active agents in a (somewhat) closed system. Every action we take as a species has consequences for ourselves and everyone sharing our space. Beyond that, I think it will be possible to modify our contribution to the changes our climate is undergoing, but I don't think it'll ever be possible to stop contributing altogether.\n\nHowever, I think 'doomed' is probably an overreaction. Change is inevitable, regardless of whether it's human-caused or not, but change doesn't necessarily mean chaos, turmoil, or suffering. I also think some of the hype regarding the consequences of climate change are overly dramatic at best and downright misleading at worst, depending on who you're listening to for your apocalypse forecast. My advice, if you're anxious about such dire predictions, is to consider that the human species has survived very dramatic climate shifts during its short existence, and while things might get difficult for us for a while, it very likely won't be anywhere near as bad as the media is saying it's going to be.\n\nLastly: You're 14 and you're asking questions that adults three times your age don't bother asking. The fact that you're actively seeking answers to those questions (instead of just passively hoping someone else will come along to hand them to you) is just incredible, and the fact that you're actually allowing new information to change your mind - well it's people like you that give me hope for my species.

Even Adam Smith believed the governments ought to intervene in market failures. When the private cost of production does not reflect the total (social) cost of production, the market tends to over produce, causing a market failure. This is precisely the case with pollution from production today. When you buy a gallon of gas, a portion of the cost is paid by you (about $3 where I am) and another portion is paid in environmental damages that negatively affect others. Because I do not incur the total cost of that gallon of gas, I will purchase more gasoline than is socially optimal.\n\nGovernments have a role here is correcting prices. This scenario could use a per unit tax on CO2 emissions that will correct the price of gasoline to reflect the total social cost of production (private costs+environmental costs+health costs= social costs).\n\nIn the case of taxes that serve to change consumer behavior it is important for governments to provide alternative options so that consumers do not lose utility from the tax. In this case, the government could reduce income tax by the same rate that they will increase the CO2 tax rate such that tax revenue remains the same if consumers do nothing to change their behavior. This will both increase the cost of gasoline, but then give consumers enough money to afford cheaper or equivalent alternatives such as \"green\" vehicles and maybe a really nice bicycle.\n\nThis does not give the government more power.
