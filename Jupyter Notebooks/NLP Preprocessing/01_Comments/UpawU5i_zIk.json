They could've employed law enforcement, the National Guard, etc., to impose their will.

The time , when the sky is full of triangles , the sun is beginning to really speed up , as the moon is a constant and a gravitational circle is filling up . Yep . As far as plastic straws and cups go - another con . Both factories are using non renewable energy, this is causing clusters of plastic in the ocean , so carbon does effect that , we are doubling up on carbon as the reusable straws and cups are using no reusable energy. The key is renewal energy , for which Einstein was excited about , but they used his idea for destruction. We had a smart mind . We had our chance for renewable energy, thus if Einstein continued , would of been able to make a renewable energy ship , that was stable enough to fly a ship on and escape, but that chance is gone now .

{"cid": "UgyYJfb2Ts42LihAhn14AaABAg", "text": "Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department Monica Crowley told Breitbart News that President Donald Trump’s “economic freedom agenda” has sparked the highly successful economic growth that has now led to the lowest unemployment rate in half a century. This past week, the administration announced that unemployment has fallen to 3.5 percent—the lowest since 1969—after a November jobs surge of 266,000 jobs created last month, numbers that blew away expectations. “Since the president’s election in November 2016, the economy has added more than 7 million jobs,” Crowley said. “This is more than the entire population of Massachusetts last year. It’s also 5.1 million more jobs than the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, projected in its final forecast before the 2016 election. What it shows is common sense economic policies based on freedom work. Tax cuts, deregulation, unleashing the energy sector, and trying to realign international trade—all of which this president promised during the campaign, all of which he has delivered. That, in turn, is delivering us this incredible economy.”", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe alonzo", "channel": "UCalxsh0z--IXjNjBoSucSNw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRCKOylPSVwaoSFyc2-re3VGIwcY67BaKtgfwuRpw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

His take on gerrymandering? Spot on. The environment, health care, gun control, exactly right. But his assumption that things that were will necessarily lead to things that will be is seriously flawed and designed to hide the issue of where Republican power comes from. It's not from grassroots activists if you need a hint, more along the lines of how the Tea Party was founded. And for all his enthusiastic and encouraging rhetoric, his explanation of gerrymandering off the top simply undermines his entire point. Politicians know they can win on the right, even if they get fewer votes because it's ultimately broken down into districts and the Republicans know they have more of the districts, with fewer people, than the Democrats do. Not to mention, does he remember civil rights well? People died, at the hands of neighbors, law enforcement, and assassination. Is that the kind of confidence he's asking people to have? The fight for civil rights prior lead to the Civil War... is that what he thinks should happen again? There were lots of nice words, but he never put the responsibility for morals and common good on the people who were elected to do those exact things.

Average pre-tax incomes for the bottom 50% of wage earners, when adjusted for inflation was $16,000 in 1980. More than 30 years later, it was $16,200.
