So, that means we live in the era of apocalypse, end of the world, right before return of christ. in fatima, Mother Mary famously reveled 3 secrets to 3 children. 2 were revealed but one was not. mother of God Maria told one of children lucia to reveal the 3rd secret in 1960. 1960 was close to the year that satanic heretical vatican II council was held and detroyed catholic mass and sacraments and traditions of church. So, It is obvious the third secret of fatima is about apostasy that will happen(already happened) in the church. you should avoid all heretics to be saved as early fathers and pope taught us to do to be saved.

It can certainly harm the local wildlife severely, but over time it will be mended due to decay and dilution.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Mshojat", "channel": "UC82Rd4qjHp53SZL8mFMc33w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRc3fCU-zNa4PFrAZ3ZTysMSye-SKPHc9u1lC37=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Meaning without personal responsibility, as well as machines invented and engineered to fix this problem, as well as industrial sectors switching to cleaner methods, we will never see those natural cycles again.

The variances you speak over occurred over hundreds and thousands of years. The little ice age and medieval warming both were created by climate change occurring over 500+ years.   The difference now is the rate of change.  Over our entire atmospheric record from ice cores, we have never seen anything even remotely close to the change we are seeing today.  Carbon changes that took thousands of years just happened in the last 150 years.  It is unprecedented and to write it off as natural phenomenon is dangerous.

You look at potential mechanisms, you look at how it's warming. Different mechanisms have different ways of warming (and cooling) the fingerprint of how climate is changing is consistent with GHGs, we can measure this in the lowered long wave radiation going out into space, the cooling in the upper atmosphere, we can look at when it's warming and what long term trends are.\n\nWe can likewise discount mechanisms by looking at the instrumental record, the sun has been cooling and the sun would warm at the equator faster than the poles so it's not the sun. Cosmic rays don't appear to have any appreciable effect on the climate particularly since correlations broke down in the early 90's and events like the Laschamp anomaly indicate that even if they have any effect on climate that it is no more than a fine tuning knob rather than a significant driver in climate.\n\nIf you want to be a good skeptic at least when you're asserting \"it's natural\" provide a damned mechanism that can be tested.

If you wonder if CO2 specifically could do such a thing, there are elementary school projects where you can use baking soda and vinegar to dump CO2 into a bottle and see if it'll be warmer than the bottle without CO2.\n\nI wasn't aware that basic science over 100 years old was that much in question.

Surely you admit this possibility'\n\nSure, a nuclear winter could happen and block out the sun resulting in a drop in temperatures.\n\nRealistically there's lots of reasons why temperatures could fall, as far as natural cycles nothing that would be in the near long term other than the possibility of a new maunder minimum.\n\nI'm going by the information we have and even if the sun goes into a maunder minimum resulting in a temporarily much cooler sun it'd result in about .3C cooling by the year 2100 if no other factors were at play.\n\n\"Would you pump out more co2 if temps took a down-turn?\"\n\nIf we could reliably turn up and down the thermostat on a dime, sure? History and physics says that'd be a bad idea though, since it would depend on the mechanism. Like if people depended on the sun never returning to regular solar cycles it'd be a terrible idea.\n\nAlso we already know that a given amount of warming/energy to the system takes a long time to normalize for it's given forcing, even if we stopped all CO2 emissions today it'll continue to warm till it normalizes with the appropriate forcing.\n\n\"You haven't proven any relationship between co2 and temp.\"\n\nBasic physics?

If you want an analogue the light you see from the surface of the sun is thousands of years old using the exact same mechanism. The lower concentration of material that absorbs the specific radiation just changes the lag time.\n\nLets use another type of argument using your exact type of reasoning. CO2 is such a small part of the atmosphere that obviously it cannot be what plants use to grow. We all know it's bull shit, but you continually focus on the small concentrations and conclude it can't have an effect simply because of this. These are feeling statements, not scientific ones.\n\n\"We are not exiting a snowball earth. I dont know what brought us out of the snowball earth.\"\n\nSnowball earth is an example of how CO2 can result in an initial warming mechanism particularly when other factors like orbital factors won't result in sufficient warming, particularly when the whole surface is white. It's an exercise in this thing called critical thinking.\n\n\" Look up Robert Watson ...\"\n\nDon't care what individuals say about the IPCC, the IPCC just attempts to summarize scientific papers and they've actually been notorious for being overly conservative. For example they don't estimate the arctic will be ice free during the summer till after 2100 because they simply don't model dynamic ice sheering. Many papers that do estimate it will be ice free during the summer as early as 2030-2040.\n\n\"I am not sure you even read the paper you sent me....\"\n\nIt mentions the initial forcing and the reasoning for how ghgs would amplify small initial and local  forcing and through various processes warms the rest of the globe. There's this thing called reading between the lines.\n\n\"Have you read the Caillon paper yet?\"\n\nThe Caillon paper that explains this in even better detail that you probably haven't read yet? A long time ago. =P\n\n\" but her strategy is to overwhelm and irritate....\"\nHi pot and calling me a \"her\" despite my masculine name makes me wonder about what kinda \"girls\" you're dating.\n\n\"She will not be able to explain temp rise preceding co2 rise in the ice core record. That is a very strong argument against man-made co2 global warming.\"\n\nKinetic energy can cause fire, so fire cannot cause kinetic energy....your argument in a nut shell. You are not rational, if you really have a bachelors in physics you'll be able to see why your argument is completely flawed.\n\nIf you wanted to make a rational argument with a relevant background you'd have addressed the 3.7 w/m^2 argument. You'd have explained why simply having a low percentage in the atmosphere despite it's volume can't result in more heat retention in the same atmosphere. There are so many other ways you could approach this from a physics standpoint but you keep relying on the same type of argument because you cannot understand how complex systems can result in such a lag time.\n\nSome scientists to simply demonstrate to people at how how even small concentrations of something can block light in such a fashion take some ink and mix it in water in the exact same concentrations as CO2 in the atmosphere and it's much more readily apparent. The principle is the same, the ink absorbs the visible light just like CO2 absorbs the long wave radiation, it just doesn't re emit it.\n\nPut on your thinking caps now, you know it takes around 800 years lag time for the oceans to warm up enough to start expelling CO2 from a slow initial warming because of how long it takes for the new warming to mix in the oceans. There's your lag time. TADAAAAAA.\n\nSince you'll probably ask \"how we know it takes about 800 years for this to happen\" I'll ask a simple question you already answered in the conversation. \"what causes most of the increase in CO2\" A: the warming of the oceans.

{"cid": "UgjvmpAjonDGUHgCoAEC.86mhSeu1lx287FQ_76vVYb", "text": " @Jerome Sullivan \n\"PS. my disproof of the significance of 3.7 w/m^2\"\n\nThe forcing that's a result of milankovitch cycles are .7 w/m^2. Currently you're supposedly operating under the assumption that CO2 and other trace ghgs cannot result in an amplification of this effect. Either this .7 w/m^2 is astronomically stronger than you think it is or positive feedbacks can amplify initial warming.\n\nAlso your assumption is that CO2 which is just an initial forcing is the only factor that would be at play....Nothing in geological history or the rest of the physics would indicate this should be the case. Unless you think the energy gained in the system from for example white ice changing to dark blue ocean is zero, positive feedbacks are still factors till you reach thermal equilibrium.\n\n\"Volume of Antarctic ice\"\n\nSummer or winter ice? Land or sea ice? And why the Antarctic? Your assumption also seems to be that you think that this forcing would apply uniformly. If you read the earlier posts you know this isn't true. For example areas like the poles would warm quicker than the equators because they naturally have a much lower water vapor content, which means less water vapor to compete for those overlapping wavelengths of long wave radiation.\n\n\"feel free to check my work.\"\n\nI'm happy to just grant it as good work, merely the assumptions behind it are flawed.\n\n\"Then I heard the arguments of Don Easterbrook, Freeman Dyson and Buzz Aldrin among others.\"\n\nWell Don Easterbrook has shown to be rather dishonest when you look at original sources and has made vastly wrong predictions. Back in 2008 he said we'd have cooled by as much as 1C from the year 2000, even if you ignore ocean warming, at best from 1998, a time when we know was abnormally high due to short term effects and all of the other cooling effects, it's still not cooling. Dyson Admits he's not an expert in climate (I don't know about you but I think expertise matters, I wouldn't get a dermatologist to do brain surgery simply because he's an expert in something), Buzz Aldrin really doesn't have a background either. I'm not sure why you started with these 3, these would seem like poor examples.\n\n\"It is undeniable that the skeptical arguments are much stronger than the alarmist arguments.\"\n\nSorry, but going by your arguments so far and the assumptions made in this final proof you simply haven't read the vast body of scientific research or are even aware of what the relevant experts are saying. You even label them as \"alarmist\" in the same way a creationist labels someone else \"evolutionist\"...Sorry but you're doing the equivalent of siding with the creationists because you only listened to people like Michael Behe or Kent Hovind. I started off as a skeptic with skeptic arguments and I sought out the answers from relevant experts and peer reviewed papers directly, the skeptics had no response other than to complain about uncertainty and how such things couldn't be predicted, then state how they could predict them with double talk.\n\nWhen direct correlations break down with standard science they can list the mechanisms and show the measurements or show what assumptions you made that they do not, or what mechanisms you're ignoring that they do not ignore. When this happens with skeptics they say \"well the climate is complicated\" but then won't even listen to relevant papers that explain the complicated part with relation to the vast majority of relevant experts.\n\nSkeptics don't provide mechanisms for past climate changes when confronted with issues like the forcing from a given orbital change. They don't want to provide mechanisms for this change that can be tested. They don't want to address counter arguments like looking at the Laschamp anomaly and even question if cosmic rays really have as much of an effect as they want to say it does. Skeptics will choose older data particularly in ancient reconstructions in favor of ignoring new ones with better and more sensitive equipment.\n\n\"Skeptics\" just like creationists assert global scientific conspiracy and when they run out of arguments merely accuse people of fiddling with the data. Sorry, but if you've ever debated a creationist on this topic you have to realize that you're using the same shotgun approach, the same distrust in the vast majority of scientists, the same lack of informed assumptions and this is frankly the first time you've actually tried to defend something you've said, I'll be it on a tangent rather than directly.\n\nP.S. I figured I'd post an old news article from NOAA since this apparently was one of your misc favorite claims. I'm sure I'll just hear a \"scientists are just fiddling with the figures\" or something like that, but frankly if that's going to be the go to response rather than doing their own experiments to show why the reasoning is poor then I think I'm probably in better company.\n\nhttp://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/noaa-analysis-journal-science-no-slowdown-in-global-warming-in-recent-years.html", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

All the same you're talking about a low forcing and having it magically spread across the whole earth at a much higher degree of that original forcing.

I am labeling you as an alarmist.\"\n\nBased on what? All you know about me is that I accept that man made carbon gases are the primary cause of most of the warming in the later half of the century.\n\nYou have asked zero regarding any predictions, this doesn't sound very scientific of you.\n\n\"Don’t you think that sea level will rise 6-20ft by the end of the\ncentury like your “experts” say?\"\n\nWell, point out the experts please, point to the sources. The IPCC which most people say is an alarmist organization predicts anywhere from 75cm to 2 metres which is the low end of your claim. By the way, for as much as people say the IPCC is alarmist the trends are tracking with the upper end of their error bars....which indicates they're under estimating sea level rise, but hey who needs facts when you have labels.\n\nIf you say \"Al Gore\" I hope you don't mind if I laugh at you.\n\n\"Thanks for using sceptic instead.\"\n\nYeah, you're treading the line though, virtually everything you've thrown at me so far I could have gone to a denialist blog. I say denialist because they actually deny facts even when corrected.\n\n\"I know you’ve heard “the science is in” with regards to climate;\"\n\nFrankly, it's been a question since the 60s and the majority of relevant experts weren't convinced till the mid 90's after the major concerns were addressed with evidence. No one's saying \"no more research needs to be done\" but it's about as definitive as you can get, the most you can do is quibble about how bad it'll be and how much you'd like to gamble long term prospects to encourage inaction.\n\n\"20ft of sea level rise...\"\n\ncite your source please\n\n\" climate instability are indeed extraordinary claims.\"\n\nSo you don't think the climate is changing significantly?\n\n\"You are making the mistake of thinking that it is their job to prove you wrong when the\nburden is really on you to prove yourself right.\"\n\nThere's plenty of evidence and observations pointing to the most likely cause of GHGs, I've pointed you towards them this whole conversation, you simply don't want to answer the relevant questions that would make you question your existing narrative.\n\nSpecific mechanisms show warming in specific areas quicker, we see the fingerprint that's consistent with GHGs including cases like lower long wave radiation escaping the atmosphere in the bands that ghgs absorb. We even observe the cooling in the upper stratosphere which was predicted long ago. Any one of these observations in a vacuum would be no deal, it's the fact that they all point in the same direction that's relevant. It has passed so many tests in the scientific arena that it qualifies as a theory.\n\nWhen you confront a case where a testable model has passed the tests and someone else comes by and says \"that's not right but I won't say why\" it then becomes their burden to explain the phenomenon and propose a better model. No theory is perfect, whether it's general relativity, Evolution or quantum theory, but it takes a lot more than finding possible problems or whining to make it stop from being a theory.\n\nNo skeptic wishes to actually challenge this and simply claims fraud, and won't provide mechanisms that are at least consistent with the way it has been warming.\n\n\"You haven’t shown me ANYKIND of extraordinary evidence.\"\n\nUh, just the requirements of a theory, make predictions based upon a proposed mechanism and confirm it with later observations. If you don't like the scientific method it's on you to provide a better model that represents reality and mechanism that explains the observations in a testable model.\n\n\"Again No one knows how climate works just like no-one knows how life started.\"\n\nno one knows how life started because there's so many venues by which it could have happened and it's impossible to piece together exactly which one it was.\n\nThe warming in question occurred in the instrumental record which means if you look at how it's warmed you can test mechanisms. Big difference.\n\nEven if we pretend to hide behind the \"no one knows\" this doesn't change the fact that an energy imbalance occurred which resulted in more retained heat and things don't happen for no reason, constantly repeating this and then taking no further steps is basically trying to end the conversation like you accused people of doing earlier.\n\n\"But they have failed in the past miserably with predictions.\"\n\nwell\n1) This is like saying newton is wrong because einstein did it better, even if technically true, Newton was still mostly right.\n\n2) If you've actually looked at the predictions they're actually not that far off. It gets far better when you calibrate them with other factors like the increased volcanic activity, the dimming sun, increased pollution and el nino/la nina cycles. (which we know are short term factors)\n\nIf you use the \"alarmist\" IPCC as a standard they've so far under estimated a lot of predictions like ice melt or sea level rise. Most people that assume they've been vastly wrong usually have it first filtered through someone else like Lord Monkton or Watts and never look at the original source.\n\n\"Like I said, I only see the science or lack thereof that is what I’ve been trained to do. \"\n\nYeah, you still might want to just give that degree to me, because frankly as a scientist you should be the most concerned with the mechanisms, the predictions and observations. Virtually everything you've done is to avoid these key topics, I mean how many dozens of tangents did you bring up that really didn't prove anything no matter how many times I proved you wrong? Even your long math rant avoided it.\n\nHeck, I asked you to justify your statement of how you think such a low concentration of CO2 couldn't possibly have an effect on the climate how many times?

{"cid": "UgjvmpAjonDGUHgCoAEC.86mhSeu1lx287RyNrMwz4A", "text": "+garith21 \n\n\n\nI don’t think this will convince anyone. Most things like this can’t be disproven. There are things that could convince me, if co2 rose before temperature in the ice-core record, if there had been any significant\nwarming over the last 15 years as more of the world industrialized; these would be very strong arguments (arguments that I thought were true when I bought into the hype). Computer models don’t do it for me (i have experience with models that deal with heat and chemistry). Aside from the inherent limitations of computers, there are many rates and processes that are poorly understood. It took weather forecasts decades for their predictions to be accurate beyond a week. It will take a long time before we understand climate enough to make predictions 100 years in the future.\n\nAlbedo is the ratio of energy reflected to the initial energy. Planetary equilibrium temperature is a function of albedo and irradiance. The average surface absorbs twice as much energy (163.3w/m^2) as the entire\natmosphere above it (77.1w/m^2), energy that is then dumped back into the atmosphere at night (the earth cools more because of its rotation). And the surface changes all the time: foliage, ice, asphalt roads, etc..\n\nI think there is a misconception that only infrared light can heat things up, this is incorrect (have you ever been burned by a green laser? I have.) it is a matter of intensity. Even an ozone molecule is heated up when a uv photon is absorbed. When you look at a solar irradiance absorption spectrum you can clearly see that the highest irradiance per wavelength occurs around 500nm (a dull green). Co2 absorbs radiation further down the spectrum where there is not as much energy but water vapor dominates this area of the spectrum and will always compete with co2. \n\nNo one can say that the warming that occurred between 1977\nand 2000 is unprecedented because there was a similar period of warming 30 years prior which was certainly not co2. No one can prove or disprove a statement like, “the warming that occurred between ’77 and ’00 is due to co2”, anymore than you can prove that it was due to Elvis dying in ’77. If you look at a graph of co2 vs temp for this period they do appear to rise together but this DOES NOT MEAN co2 and temp are related, correlation does not imply causation and coincidence cannot be ruled out. It is safe to say that the trends have separated after the start of the 21st century.\n\nResearching this subject is a nightmare. There are people who have, no doubt, been caught doctoring graphs like Shaun Marcott and Richard Muller among a few others. No doubt there are those on the skeptics side injecting speculative and untrue information as well, I have seen them while researching this. I think this is why both sides have lost faith in eachother. Many sites and sources give completely true information but they will pick and choose periods of time that support their arguments like the '77-'00 period. This thing is a circus and a perfect example of why politics and science don’t mix.\n\nI am not saying humans can’t be a significant factor in climate, but I am saying it there is no reason to think co2 is a major threat based on empirical evidence. To boot, much of the last 10,000 years has been warmer. Google \"temperature last 10000 years\" to see what i mean. There have been periods of faster warming for longer periods of time in the not so distant past. \n\n \n\n\n \n\nThe reason m-cycles effect the climate appears to be the changes in albedo that result. The following is how my professor explained to me, I used his lectures as a source, It is not obvious until you hear it:\n\nThe earth does not orbit in a perfect circle, rather, it orbits in an ellipse with an eccentricity of 0.0167 (current). The difference in irradiance between apogee and perigee (a result of greater distance from the sun at apogee) is about 2.0w/m^2.  The approximate fraction of that is absorbed by the atmosphere is 0.7w/m^2. That is what that number refers to and that is accurate for the atmosphere but the surface of the earth is different….\n\nBecause of Kepler’s laws, a planet spends more time at apogee than perigee and remember the earth is tilted. So, sometimes the northern\nhemisphere is pointed toward the sun (summer) when earth is at perigee\nresulting in short super-summers. At those same times the northern hemisphere is pointed away at apogee resulting in long super-winters. Meanwhile the opposite hemisphere has long cool summers and short mild winters. Currently, perigee is in July (near the peak of summer) so the northern hemisphere is the one experiencing the super-seasons at the moment.\n\nThese short super-summers and long super-winters don’t effect the atmosphere that much because the atmosphere is more/less uniform. The\nsurface, however, is not. There is much more land mass in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. The south pole has a continent almost twice as big as Australia centered at the pole while the north pole has no land mass there at all (military submarines can pop through the seasonal sea ice there). The net result is that the hemispheres have a different capacity to hold ice, the result of this is that the albedo of the earth changes depending on which hemisphere is getting the super-seasons. The case is really even more complicated than this and there are still unknowns. The earths eccentricity changes as it interacts with other planets and these effects are more pronounced when eccentricity is high (range: 0.06-0.005) M-cycles are some of the dominant factors over timescales of 10s of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years, they don’t appear to effect things on shorter timescales. \n\nI'll give you the last word garith.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Jerome Sullivan", "channel": "UCJBwmHhUnFOjhPDfsurtJzg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRLhoyazylRd4YkNHseB0tFxszcT8ZOc8VpaoOA3w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Particularly since even today's solar activity wouldn't be able to break out a completely ice covered earth.\n\nIronically people who don't know about this like to do stuff like take snap shots when CO2 concentrations were really high at the end of snow ball earth and ask \"If CO2 was so high, how did we have mile high ice at the equator\". It's the equivalent of having a frozen cabin, turning on the heater to full and going \"why isn't it hot yet\" It took time and a lot of CO2 for the CO2 to overpower the forcing from the high albedo of the ice. When it melted the ice it swung to a hot house like condition. If you reject this interpretation, what melted the multi mile thick ice and why did it swing to a hot house with no ice caps at all after it melted?\n\n\"I think there is a misconception that only infrared light can heat things up\"\n\nAccording to who? Do you think that the warming of the earth's surface by short wave radiation is only accomplished through infrared? No one believes this.\n\n\"and will always compete with co2. \"\nActually it'll only compete in cases where they do overlap, there's plenty where it doesn't, not to mention there are many areas where there is less water vapor which is why CO2 has a greater effect in those areas. Already been over this.\n\n\"because there was a similar period of warming 30 years prior which was certainly not co2\"\n\nTends to happen when aerosol concentrations lower, much of which that period of abnormal cooling was attributed to. I don't know why you pretend like anyone says that the mechanisms always have to be the same, because no one makes this claim.\n\n\"No one can prove or disprove a statement like, “the warming that occurred between ’77 and ’00 is due to co2”, \"\n\nWho care's about the physics and observations indicating the primary cause right? So what if you can observe and test the primary mechanism by examining the change in long wave radiation leaving the earth and which bands are getting absorbed and where. Just say it's impossible and the problem goes away.\n\n\" There are people who have, no doubt, been caught doctoring graphs like Shaun Marcott and Richard Muller \"\n\nAccording to whom exactly? Richard Muller was a part of the skeptic circles and started with skeptic arguments and then started the BEST project and he's kept with his open practices since it's founding. People merely accuse him of doctoring graphs because he happens to come to similar conclusions to work of the past. Keep in mind before skeptics dumped for just the preliminary results he was partially funded by the Koch brothers and brought in qualified skeptics to also work on the project. Heck, even Judith Curry the co author is still apparently a skeptic despite her own erroneous statements on the matter that have been addressed by the scientific community.\n\nI even see skeptics claiming that BEST proves global warming is false, even though BEST seems to indicate no such thing.\n\nI don't know much of Marcott's work, but my understanding is that it's still in good standing with the scientific community\n\n\"'77-'00 period. This thing is a circus and a perfect example of why politics and science don’t mix.\"\n\nWell the 77-today discussion is primarily when temperatures rise out of natural noise where natural markers and models start disagreeing and only seem to agree when you take into account carbon based gases as a factor. Despite skeptics accusing proponents of fudging numbers to match the observations they can't seem to make models that recreate past observations without including GHGs even though they should be able to do exactly the same thing.\n\n\"Currently, perigee is in July (near the peak of summer) so the northern hemisphere is the one experiencing the super-seasons at the moment.\"\n\nI should also point out that a lot of the mechanisms you're proposing would only explain local warming, it wouldn't explain how it could spread through the rest of the globe which is exactly what the GHG mechanisms were supposed to explain because it would only result in a local warming without them.\n\nWell on top of the fact that your proposed mechanism are completely ignoring the fingerprints of ghg based warming that have been observed I'll give you a hint of why we know this isn't the primary factor at play right now.\n\nHow long does it take for this difference to take place? Hint, it's longer than the century and you even know this because it's one of the last things you said.\n\n\"M-cycles are some of the dominant factors over timescales of 10s of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years, they don’t appear to effect things on shorter timescales.\"\n\nDerp", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Orbital factors were also at play but they were very minor at a rate around -.02C/century. During the middle of the lia there was also a major decrease in solar activity which amplified the already massive cooling from increased volcanic activity which released more aerosols.\n\n\"How do these two climate events compare to the climate change you've seen during your lifetime?\"\n\nwith regards to time scale, pretty insignificant in comparison to today. I mean skeptics often claim that .1C/decade (the current rate) is not a big deal but when you look at averages that it took to get to the medieval warm period that took hundreds of years to achieve what took a few decades today. The Medieval warm period was also pretty cool in comparison to today.\n\nThe LIA was only a .4C drop from conditions previous to it and that took a few hundred years as well. This is assuming you're using the most extreme reconstructions and not the average reconstructions for that time period.\n\nIn all reality, I don't know why someone claiming to be a skeptic would even ask this question which is quite easy to verify yourself.", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjqlfwFSDKIzngCoAEC", "text": "How to Win The Climate Change Debate Every time\n            There are many common beliefs about what climate change actually is. This is a problem that is specific to this current generation due to the technological advances that are supposedly the cause. There is a high amount of activism going on about stopping man-made climate change, but I'm going to show you why this is a waste of time. Climate change and global warming are not the same things.\nLet's look at the definitions. Based on Global Warming the unabridged guide...\"Global Warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and it's projected continuation.\" This rise in temperature is due to the activities of humans and that is from a 95% consensus from scientist on a U.N. panel. In short the definition of global warming is that the actions of humans are causing the earth to get hotter and it will eventually lead to the end of the earth. It is not the same thing as climate change. Climate change is something that has been going on since the beginning of time. It is the natural fluctuation of the earth's climate. We don't have any control of it. For example, who cause who caused the ice age? Was it the dinosaurs? Who brought us out of the ice age? Was it the first human settlers that caused the earth to thaw by their smoke signal and camp fires harming the ozone layer? If you think about if longer than two minutes you will realize it's not likely.\nThe first claim I will debunk is this. Cow flatulence is causing the Ozone later to open and cause global warming. Many of you may feel this is just a ridiculous claim that I am making up. If only that was the case. The White House wants to regulate cow farts. Vaccines are even being developed to decrease the amount of greenhouse gases(cattle flatulence) being emitted. Australian farmers are even signing their sheep and cattle up to get vaccinated for this purpose.\nLet's use common sense. If cow or cattle flatulence is so dangerous to this planet, what happened when the dinosaurs were around? Dinosaurs are said to have roamed the planet for 165 million years. Over the span of 165 million years you can safely figure that the accumulated population of dinosaurs exceeds that of cows and other cattle of this present time. You can also safely figure that dinosaurs are multiple times more massive than cows and any other animal on this planet. We could look at the recent discovery of the Titanosaurus for reference. This is said to be the largest animal to ever walk the planet. The point is that the dinosaurs would have emitted more greenhouse gases than cows due to their gargantuan size. They also would have emitted more gas over a time of 165 million years. According to the original claim this should have caused many massive holes in the ozone layer. As you can see the earth is not a ball of flames, and not only that but we had an ice age. We should have had an extremely hot age with those high amount of global warming causing factors.But we did not. Simply put, the ice age we had was natural climate change. This climate change happens without the actions of humans. Another point you must consider is how we left the ice age, surely is was not because of the camp fires of settlers emitting gases into the ozone later.\nThe second claim is that human caused global warming is causing the polar bears to almost go extinct. The idea is that global warming is melting the polar ice caps and is destroying their environment. This is causing them to die and even eat one another. The polar bear has been the mascot for the cause of global warming for many years but when looking at the numbers, the claims do not add up. In the 1950's it was reported that there are 5,000 to 10,000 living polar bears in the world. In the year 2014, it is reported that there are 22,600 to 32,000 living polar bears on the planet. That is four times the amount from the 1950's. As far as their habitat is concerned, in 2007 Al Gore spoke intensely about scientific research he had seen and predicted the entire north polar ice caps will vanish. If we look at the data from 2013 we actually see that the polar ice caps are still there and they have increased from the last year.\nThe third claim is that we actually have to take action to stop global warming. There are billions of dollars being spent and solution being created to stop global warming. Politicians are making speeches about going green by using wind and solar power so we can cut down carbon emissions. This sounds nice and I would love to have every home powered by solar panels but if this is solely because of global warming then there is a problem. Global warming has been on a 17 years plus pause. According to NASA it's been for 17 years and six months. If we bring it up to date we see its been 17 years and nine months. This is startling information considering the growth of the population. More people means more carbon emissions going into the atmosphere. That means we should see more global warming. More global warming would bring a hotter earth  and we would see a continuous increase in temperature every year. That has not been the case with this 17 year pause. We also have more cars on the road than ever. According to a study by Wards Auto, the population of cars on the road is over one Billion. We see an increase in global warming causing factors, but no increase in temperature. If you haven't noticed, we have experienced record-breaking cold temperatures recently around the world. For example, it recently snowed in Egypt for the first time in 112 years.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Angela", "channel": "UC6jTh9ceT5hgfsOGksxuAbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTqg4ds-TxoTjw5xRgo5dULUG8b2B8SdKO9veUQsg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Deforestation is of course bad, but because of the raised CO2 levels, the rainforests have benefited hugely. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere by the way, are only 7% due directly to human emissions. The rest is natural, or the result of out-gassing. When the temperature warms soil and water release CO2 into the atmosphere. The current warning tend started long before humans began to pump CO2 into the atmosphere, and that was right after a period of cooling. \n\nOcean acidity is quite low even as it is with all the CO2. \n\nThe whole debate regarding greenhouse gases is that since CO2 and to a very small extent methane slightly heats the water, and causes more water vapour to evaporate into the atmosphere (the main greenhouse gas) this year's the planet even more, and more water evaporates and so on and so forth. Most climate models (which are usually wrong) use this feedback system as the only factor in climate change.

That's just an excuse, and a logical fallacy.\n\nBy the way... many animals also commit acts of rape, sniff and lick each others anuses... why are you cherry-picking a single activity they do, and not partaking in the rest?﻿\n\nBy the way, if you’re still wondering why I refuse to actively end animal-on-animal killings, it’s because omnivores/carnivores don’t claim to be holier-than-thou beings created in the image of God. As long as my species makes this outrageous claim, I will force everyone to “walk the talk” because picking and choosing when to be kind – and who to be kind to – is purely evil. Once humans stop tormenting and killing billions of innocents, I will fly to the jungles of Tanzania and convince lions not to kill zebras. In the meantime, the morality mirror is firmly positioned in front of our faces.\nFor people who still insist that lions – and other animal-on-animal killers – should be arrested and charged with murder, I support that sentiment as long as humans who eat meat, dairy and eggs turn themselves in to face the same consequences. For the record, if we want to arrest animals and charge them with murder, we need to grant them equal rights; animals currently have NO standing in court, which means we cannot legally bring them to trial. As soon as animals have the SAME rights of life, liberty and happiness as humans, I will personally oversee the first arrest. \n\nIf the vast majority of the world population sees this as naive and ill informed then the vast majority of us are insane.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "AlwaysSoldierOn", "channel": "UCXHr1_0apzgYgKy63SxzUHw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSsEkKWjqi_rc-UvgDvgw1S-QkSW2tRopI4MG1s=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Eggs, fish, honey, and insects could easily be quite sustainable at current population levels.\n2. In addition, population levels could decrease over time resulting in more flexibility for per-capita emissions.\n3. The amount a person consumes is ultimately what decides if something is sustainable, not whether they consume it at all (unless something is 100% non-renewable)\\\n4. If combustion and calcination rates continued to escalate, emissions from those sources would still be a major problem to contribute to the greenhouse effect regardless of what the agricultural emissions were at.\n\n What these points mean —and ignoring the last one— is that people will have to —or should— be consuming significantly less large animal meats such as Cow, Pig, Bison, Deer/Caribou, Kangaroo, and Ostrich. In addition, it also means not allowing too many animals to live in the wild. If everyone was vegan and noone killed any animals, they could eventually grow to such large populations where they could grow in environmental impact. Examples would be creatures such as rabbits, bison, geese, seals, and deer, which don&#39;t have much or any significant amount of predators in many of their main environments.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Mshojat", "channel": "UC82Rd4qjHp53SZL8mFMc33w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRc3fCU-zNa4PFrAZ3ZTysMSye-SKPHc9u1lC37=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There were times in earth's history where sea levels were 200 feet higher, it doesn't mean that it's something we should be working towards.\n\n\n\"This climate change happens without the actions of humans.\"\nPast climate change is usually primarily due to orbital factors that result in initial releases of ghgs which change local warming/cooling into global warming/cooling, but even this tends to take tens of thousands of years to change temperatures on a global basis by large swings baring large events like asteroid impacts or super volcano eruptions.\n\n\n\"in 2007 Al Gore spoke intensely about scientific research he had seen and predicted the entire north polar ice caps will vanish. If we look at the data from 2013 we actually see that the polar ice caps are still there and they have increased from the last year.\"\nUh, did they have any prediction when it would vanish? As far as I know the peer reviewed literature indicated that summer sea ice in the arctic would be gone somewhere in the next 20-30 years, the IPCC predicted not till the end of the century. Winter ice in the Arctic will be there for the foreseeable future, but if you've seen live streams of the north pole during the summer it's actually been more like the north pool for the last few years.\n\n\n\" In the 1950's it was reported that there are 5,000 to 10,000 living polar bears in the world. In the year 2014, it is reported that there are 22,600 to 32,000 living polar bears on the planet.\"\nAccording to? I'd also be more inclined to think that this is primarily due to the difference in detection techniques since we're much better at finding/counting things now than we were in the 50's.\n\n\n\n\"Global warming has been on a 17 years plus pause.\"\n\nExcept it's not, first of all this claim usually starts around 1998 which is very much not an average year as it was one of the strongest el nino's in recorded history and it was near a time of a solar maximum. These two events are among the strongest short term events that can swing surface temperatures. The proper question to ask when confronted with this is \"why are current temperatures regardless of those factors on par with that double event without those factors?\" IE why is that the new norm for temperatures?\n\n\nSecondly the vast amount of warming is occurring in the oceans and is decidedly not on a pause.\n\n\n\"More global warming would bring a hotter earth  and we would see a continuous increase in temperature every year.\"\nHotter globally is exactly what we're seeing, but you're looking in places where it's much more variant based on other factors and ignoring where most of the warming currently is and also cherry picking starting points with other factors causing natural variance to be unusually high and insisting that should be the new average.\n\n\nSecondly there are other various factors at play contributing to cooling like more sulfates being produced by volcanoes, greater pollution resulting in less sunlight reaching the earth's surface which decreases the amount of long wave radiation that ghgs have to work on and the fact that the sun has been less active over the last 50 years.\n\nThe science of ghgs are pretty basic, more ghgs result in less heat dissipation for a given amount of long wave radiation. If you increase the concentration it reduces the heat dissipation, if you reduce the amount of long wave radiation you reduce the temperatures. Despite all of the factors contributing to cooling we're still seeing global surface temperatures on par with 1998, why is that? Magic?\n\n\"If you haven't noticed, we have experienced record-breaking cold temperatures recently around the world. For example, it recently snowed in Egypt for the first time in 112 years.\"\n\n\nFirst, the vast majority of record breaking is in the warming direction, secondly we're talking about climate, not weather. This is like saying a desert stops being a desert the day it floods. No one in the scientific community ever predicted \"no more cold records\" merely that the ratio of cold temperatures to hot temperatures will shift more towards the hot temperatures on average.\n\n\nLastly copy/pasting is very much not impressive and it may indicate you know very little on the topic you espouse to care about.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And you point about crops- you are 100% correct- if we stopped farming animals for food we would not need to grow as many crops to feed them therefore reducing plant species extinction and allowing plant populations to return to their normal biodiversity!

It will then start to fall again, as it has before.\"\n\nStrange that temperatures track fairly well with the sun till recent years and now you're saying it's got a lag time on surface temperatures when it suits you. With the dimmer sun if you expected no other factors were significant you'd expect cooling, but we're not cooling and unless you cherry pick really hard we've still been warming.\n\n\"yes, and this generates an average which is used when dealing with weather spikes.
