He is saying the opposite, if anything, we should be adding carbon since that is what vegetation needs to flourish. He's saying the more carbon, the greener earth becomes. Plants give oxygen. He is saying all their models and assumptions are completely and provably wrong. It's all a guess on their part and being used to install fear to control us. I don't believe a single thing from media. If anything, I suspect the opposite of whatever they do say. More people died of the flu than without last year (2020) based on death certificates (source: CDC). There wasn't a pandemic at all. Whatever the novel virus is, it isn't deadly. It was theater. But for a specific reason. Crush the western countries. Crush our economies. Establish normalizing losing our rights. Crush the value of the US dollar. You cannot take power globally, remove national governments and laws if the richest countries are doing great economically for the most part. The injection is key. I don't know what its purpose is, but I do know they stoked fear to get people willingly to receive it. And \"unvaxxed\" people who live closely with \"vaxxed\" people are getting sick seemingly from the \"vaxxed\". Like a self-disseminating vaccine. Like the kind they use on animals to depopulate them when overpopulation happens. And coincidentally, billions of dollars is funding race hate groups like BLM internationally so everyone is distracted and fighting each other - internationally, fighting the invisible boogeyman. That's what it all is. Theater, deadly, dangerous theater.\r\n\r\nI think psychopaths are winning right now. And I suspect very dark days ahead, like real evil. I'm bracing for the next shoe to drop.

He does not work with climate, has written no climate change papers and has no formal training in it. He has even been refuted by his own American Physical Society, who vehemently disagree with him. \n\nThe 97% consensus, in fact, is confirmed by eight separate peer-reveiwed studies. EIGHT. (Oreskes, 2004; Doran, 2009; Anderegg, 2010; Cook, 2013; Verheggan, 2014; Stenhouse, 2014; Carlton, 2015; Powell, 2019.)\n\n\r\r\nNaomi Oreskes has been a professor of science history at the University of California and professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University.  She has worked on studies of geophysics, environmental issues and global warming, as well as the history of science. \n\nMichael Mann is a climatologist and geophysicist and director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. He has authored over 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers and is best known for his hockey stick data, which has been confirmed by two dozen follow-up studies by other scientists and affirmed by the National Academy of Sciences. \n\nThe 97% consensus is publicly endorsed by the IPCC and 170 major scientific institutions and academies of science around the world. Not a single scientific institution with national or international standing rejects it. \n\nHere are the endorsing scientific institutions. I urge you to visit their websites and read their public positions on climate change. Hopefully it will begin to illuminate to you just how far afield from the empirical evidence William Happer is.

Happer says doubling CO2 will do little or nothing to raise temperature. ALL of the scientific data and the official IPCC position is that a doubling of CO2 will, in the short term, raise global temperature 3C and, over the long term, 6C, more than enough to cause catastrophe. \n\nYou can listen to Happer, who is not a climate scientist and has no data to back his viewpoint, and who was funded for years by the fossil fuel industry when he ran the CO2 Coalition to increase fossil fuel usage, or you can believe the scientific literature and the world's publishing climate scientists. \n\nCO2-driven warming is already raising average global temperature. 19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record, according to all six of the world's leading climate data centers. 2020 was tied for first.\n\nThat warming is melting icecaps and glaciers at rates unprecedented in recorded history. The meltwater is raising sea levels 5mm per year, according to the World Meteorological Organization. That's up from 1.5mm per year throughout most of the 20th century. \n\nAccording to NOAA, high tide flooding has risen 140% along the American northeast in just the last 20 years. It's up an astonishing 190% along the southeast. It's why the City Dock neighborhood of Annapolis is flooding out 65 times a year and why Miami has elevated seawalls, moved buildings and raised 105 miles of roads. It's also why New York has a new $10 billion-dollar flood mitigation project the works. \n\nThe data also shows that wildfire seasons around the world have expanded by a month; extreme precipitation events have risen sharply, and droughts are increasing in severity. While category 1 and 2 huricanes have declined, cat 4 and 5 hurricanes have nearly doubled over the last 35 years, according to the very latest research.\n\nHapper is just plain wrong, and there are really sound reasons why the world's scientists refute him.", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In general I disagree with most of it, but even a broken clock is right twice a day, and in this particular case the speaker, who is clearly an eminent scientist (who co-wrote a paper with Freeman Dyson, and is/was? on the physics faculty at Princeton), may be making some points that are, at some level, at least cogent.  Science cannot function properly without skepticism and climate science should be more welcoming of scientists willing to come forward with controversial or contrary perspectives.  \n\nThough personally definitely liberal in most respects, the \"theory\" of global warming has always struck me as falling short of a scientific standard, certainly insofar as projecting the future of the earth's climate many years into the future are not within the range of things that science can reliably predict.  We can say with considerable precision where each of the planets will be relative to each other hundreds of years from now, and can exactly predict the inter-actions of subatomic particles in isolated systems,  we cannot predict complex, emergent phenomena like climate with any similar level of reliability, and arguably, making predictions about the climate 50-100 years from now is a little bit silly.\n\nThe professor clearly has a political axe to grind, making sarcastic comments about B. Sanders and OAC.  Bringing politics into science, in any way, is a generally bad idea.  So in that respect his comments seems to be subject to personal bias.  But I completely agree with his comments as regards the fact that many scientific ideas turn out to be wrong; in fact the vast majority of scientific theories are eventually superseded or proven outright false.  I say that not to cast aspersion on science, but merely to point out that this is how science progresses -- by posing theories that can be proven or dis-proven and retaining only those that stand up to experiment.\n\nThere is a somewhat persuasive argument that it is better to err on the side of caution when it comes to climate change, and I agree but have a different take on that.  I think climate change should be taken very seriously, but we should be preparing for climate change of various different kinds, such as the climate becoming colder as well as becoming warmer.  \n\nI do not think we yet have the scientific prowess (specifically the computing prowess) to predict climate in the long term future.  But we do know from the geologic record that climate does change, and sometimes changes radically, in relatively short periods of time.  Many of the changes that have occurred with comparative regularity in the geologic record would be very challenging to human civilization.  So it would be a good idea to study the diversity of climatic conditions known to be possible in our terrestrial environment, and to prepare as may be practical for those that are adverse, particularly if likely to cause catastrophic harm.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "K Schuman", "channel": "UCfBWH4DTzkjrLTxwpt0zbNA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT1TWFjOx5MgwH1z7jybHR4eoVDgr9n6-N7iw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The rise in temperature followed the rise in CO2, as it did throughout millions of years of earth history.\n3. Spectroscopic analysis clearly shows heat flowing through molecules of C02 in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth, so we know for certain that a greenhouse effect exists.\n4. We can differentiate fossil fuel CO2 molecules from natural CO2 molecules through isotopic analysis. This is how we know that a substantial and growing portion of atmospheric CO2 is coming directly from fossil fuels. We've added about 47% to the total accumulation since the Industrial Revolution. \n5. As our lower atmosphere has warmed, the atmospheric layer just above it has COOLED, according to NASA monitoring since 1978. That's evidence of heat being trapped below. Neither the sun nor any natural warming force on earth can simultaneously warm the lower atmosphere while cooling the atmopheric layer above it. Only a greenhouse effect can do that.\n6. Global warming concentrates at the poles, which is why average winter temperature in Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska has risen an astonishing 8.1 degrees F since 1970. Greenland's average temperature has risen 7 degrees since 1991. \n7. The warming at the poles is why icecaps and glaciers there are melting at rates unprecedented in recorded history.\n8. The meltig ice is raising sea levels. Over the last five years, according to the WMO, average sea level rise was 5mm per year. That's up from 1.5mm per year throughout most of the 20th century. According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the American northeast coast has risen 140% in just 20 years. It's up 190% along the southeast. It's why Miami has ras moved building and raised 105 miles of roads and why New York has a new $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works. \n9.

{"cid": "Ugy9Z95YBIN6xz83UqB4AaABAg", "text": "Sorry, but his comparisons are specious and his views are disputed by the preponderance of even more credentialed and respected scientists. Sure, CO2 is not a pollutant. In fact, the Earths atmosphere was almost entirely CO2 billions of years ago. Note that there were no humans or any other species we know today alive back then. No legitimate climate scientist argues that \"pollution\" is causing climate change. This is a GIANT red herring and a completely disingenuous argument. While CO2 may not be a pollutant, just try living in a sealed room filled with it. The big problem with CO2 is that it causes the Earth's atmosphere to retain HEAT. Heat that would normally escape into space. It's kind of like shutting up the house and turning the thermostat to the max (you'll probably survive, but it's a very, very bad environment). Well, it's even worse for the Earth. As the atmosphere heats, ice melts. And that vast, VAST melting pool of ice enters the oceans and raises sea levels. And that's not all, but it's bad enough. The greatest majority of the Earth's population lives on sea coasts or on rivers or lakes affected by sea level rise. If the sea level rose 10 feet over 10,000 years (which it has in the past, more than once), we could just gradually rebuild our cities further inland or on higher ground. But respected scientists who study this (not this guy) say the rate at which the atmosphere is heating means that we will all have to deal with flooding and terrible crazy weather patterns (scorching heat, massive tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfire-inducing droughts, crop failures and the like) not in 1000 or even 100 years, but within our own lifetimes or that of our children. This can wreak havoc on national economies, cause starvation due to crop failure and force millions to migrate. Please, before you believe what this crackpot claims, watch other videos.

His crews sang vespers daily, they \"blessed\" Jesus, Mary, and John at every 1/2hr. Oh and he did not live in Biblical times. You missed that by 1400 years.\nAs for acknowledging that our observations of earths are extremely limited.

Oil industry scientists make twice as much as climate scientists. Once a climate study is completed, and all of its costs tallied, there is little money left over to pay the lead scientists. \n\nThe sun's output never varies by more than a half a degree up or down, over decades, over centuries. It is remarkably consistent. That means it has very little influence over CHANGING our climate. C02 is far more powerful in creating change because of its ability to trap and re-radiate the sun's heat back to earth. \n\nWillie Soon was secretly paid $1.2 million by the fossil fuel industry to peddle his \"It's the sun's fault\" mantra. Unfortunately for him, he got caught and his \"data\" debunked. People who don't follow science always believe him because they don't know any better.

Both Time and Newsweek featured sensationalist stories about possible cooling but the outlier scientists they quoted DID NOT REPRESENT THE MAINSTREAM CONSENSUS. \n\nThe global cooling scare of the 70s arose from a handful of scientists (not the majority, who were in fact warning about global warming even then) who worried about our ever-growing sulfate aerosol pollution problem. Sulfate aerosols, produced from burning coal, reflect sunlight and cool the planet the same way aerosols from volcanoes do. We were, in fact, in the middle of a slight cooling trend then, so the concern had some merit. \n\nBecause aerosols were also causing premature deaths and massive health and lung problems worldwide, the U.S. decided to do something and passed the Clean Air Act (1970), which significantly reduced sulfate aerosol pollution. \n\nThe long-lasting result was over $22 trillion in savings in health care, according to the EPA. Unfortunately, the drop in aerosols left C02 as the dominant pollutant, allowing it to continue to trap heat and raise global temperatures, just as MOST scientists in the 70s warned that it would.\r https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/89/9/2008bams2370_1.xml\n\nNo consensus of scientists predicted doomsday for 2000 or 2012.

The projection with the acceleration is 18 inches by 2100, more than enough to cause catastrophic flooding. So, Blitz, we just ignore that and tell the people in the future, \"Hey, it sucks to be you.\" \n\nHere's what you're missing. Each year's sea level rise gives storm surges and king tides higher platforms to launch from. Storm surges can flood miles inland. The storm surge that hit New York from Hurricane Sandy did $19 billion in damage, with subways flooded out for months before they could repair them. \n\nHigh tide flooding has already increased 140% in the northeast and 190% along the southeast. In just 20 years. Do some math, dude. Why do you think Miami has already spent half a billion dollars in elevating seawalls, moving buildings and raising 105 miles of roads? Why do you  think New York has a new $10 billion flood mitigation project in the works? For shits and giggles?\n\n\nData from the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southhampton shows that historical C02 levels of around 400ppm typically result in sea level rises of 9 meters. It takes centuries to achieve that kind of rise, but it gives a good indication of where we're headed. The warning from history is that sea level can sometimes make big jumps in a short amount of time. During the Bolling Oscillation 14,600 years ago, sea level was rising 40mm per year.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Some countries offset the extra taxes by allowing tax refunds or credits for\nhomeowners who use green energy or energy efficient products.\n\nThe U.S. pays the second-lowest gasoline tax in the world. It's about one quarter of what most of the world pays. The low tax is why Americans have a love affair with SUVs and drive the largest cars in the world. The tax hasn't been raised for nearly 30 years. Are SUVs necessary?\nIs it reasonable to feel entitled to everything we want or is it good to consider the health of the entire planet?\n\nThe UK‚Äôs¬†CO2¬†emissions fell by 2.9% in 2019, according to Carbon Brief analysis.

{"cid": "Ugx9tQh9nXY72UAn59J4AaABAg.9KdzWD5UcVj9KkMgEEl2IN", "text": "¬†@jerryw66¬† Since I work with climate data every day, and have worked as a science writer since the 1970s, I'm more than familiar with earth's past climates. Major warm periods of the past were always caused by one of two forces: (1) massive tectonic upheaval, from the break-up of continents, which spewed trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere or (2) Milankovitch Cycles, changes in our orbit, axial tilt and precession that alter how much direct sunlight the earth recieves.\n\nPast climate changes have NOTHING to do with our current warming. No natural forces are at work to warm the planet now. None. Nada. Zip. No Milankovitch Cycles (they're in cooling phases), no increased solar output (output has dropped since 1980), no massive tectonic upheaval to spew trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere. NOTHING. What we do have is a growing mass of anthropogenic C02 trapping heat in the atmosphere and radiating it back to earth.\r\n\nUNSUBSIDIZED solar and wind are now the two cheapest forms of energy on earth. When you hear about expensive electric bills due to solar or wind it's always because of locked-in utility contracts signed 10 or 20 years ago, when the price of solar and wind were high. Germany, for example, won't get out of their locked-in contracts until the 2030s. But TODAY's prices of solar and wind are cheaper than oil, gas, coal and nuclear. \n\nYou don't like solar and wind subsidies but are you okay with the fact that the world's fossil fuel industries received $5.2 trillion in subsidies in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund?\n\nThe market system is already embracing renewable energy. The electric car market is poised to explode in the next five years, as EVs are now outperforming gasoline cars in nearly every category (emissions, cost to own, cost to drive per mile, etc). Kansas and Iowa now source over 40% of their power from wind. Oklahoma gets 37% of its power from wind. Many other states are sourcing over 20% from wind. South Australia and Denmark source 50%. Scotland produces enough wind energy to power all of its homes twice over. \n\nBeware of fossil fuel industry propaganda that works relentlessly to sow seeds of doubt about climate change and renewable energy. According to investigations by Drexel University and the Union of Concerned Scientists, they've funded nearly 100 climate change denial organiations, front groups and websites, and that includes William Happer's C02 Coalition, whose mission was to INCREASE the use of fossil fuels and cast doubt on the damaging effects of C02.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They remove them with the entire post. They have deleted several of my posts because I had links in them. \n\nLet me know exactly what you'd like to know that isn't already glaringly obvious by the IPCC's refutation of Happer's beliefs. Happer, as we know, believes C02 is harmless. Neither the IPCC nor the 97% agree. That should be common knowledge.\n\nGoogle the following:  \"An Assessment of Earth's Climate Sensitivity Using Multiple Lines of Evidence\"  This is the latest study by Sherwood et al that confirms the IPCC position that a doubling of C02 in the atmosphere would raise temperature by 3C. \n\n3C is more than enough to cause disaster. Yet Happer doesnt tell you that in his presentation. Instead he points to his graph (graphs deceive the unschooled more effectively than a thousand words) at the 25:00 mark and it appears as if a doubling of C02 would accomplish nothing. But that's NOT what the scientific data says. Read the study and then read the IPCC assessment of climate sensitivity.\n\nThe 3C rise in temperature is what happens in the short term. Over the long term, according to a study led by James Hansen, temperature rises by up to 6C. That's because as warming continues, melting icecaps reveal open land and water which, instead of reflecting sunlight as ice does, it absorbs it and produces more atmospheric heat. \n\nHapper doesn't like to talk about feedback effects like that. Feedback effects work synergistically with C02 to raise temperatures higher than C02 could do on its own. So he is stunningly disingenuous when he fails to mention them.\n\nC02-driven warming accelerates evaporation, which fills the atmosphere with increased water vapor, itself a powerful greenhouse gas, which then works with C02 to increase temperatures even more. The release of methane from pent-up permafrost warms the planet further still. \n\nWhen you've read the climate sensitivity study, Google CLIMATE MISINFORMATION BY SOURCE: WILLIAM HAPPER  SkepticalScience has two different pages of Happer misnformation. One presents a short list of his erroneous beliefs, the other a more comprehensive overview. Click on each of his faulty statements there and delve into the actual data that shows how he is wrong. \n\nI'd be happy to answer anything else you want to know about Happer. As I'm sure you know, he took industry funding for years to head the C02 Coalition, whose sole mission was to increase the usage of fossil fuels. That in itself does not make him guilty. But coupled with all the science he gets wrong, whether willfully or unknowingly,  some serious fact-checking is warranted.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Over 90% of all marine animals and 2 out of 3 land animals died out from the heat.\n\nAnd Happer's explanation of that heat? He has none. And that's because C02 was to blame. It's one of many inconvenient truths in the scientific literature that he ignores. But because his audience doesn't know what they don't know, he gets a pass. \n\nDitto the complete melting of the icecaps during the dinosaur days. The meltwater flooded what we now know as Canada and the U.S. with a new ocean called the Western Interior Seaway, which remained for millions of years.

No Milankovitch Cycles (they're in cooling phases), no increased solar output (output has dropped since 1980), no massive tectonic upheaval to spew billions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere. NOTHING. What we do have is a growing mass of anthropogenic C02 trapping heat in the atmosphere and radiating it back to earth.\n\nSpectroscopic analysis clearly shows increasing heat passing through C02 in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth. Isotopic analysis clearly identifies the source of a substantial portion of this C02: the burning of fossil fuels. (Fossil fuel C02 has its own unique signature that differentiates it from natural C02).\n\nC02 was proven to trap and re-radiate heat as far back as the 1800s. Since the Industrial Revolution we've emitted more and more C02 into the atmosphere. As the C02 levels rose so did the temperature. C02 and temperature have always tracked together throughout history.\n\nAs our lower atmosphere has warmed, the atmospheric layer just above it (stratosphere) has actually COOLED, according to NASA monitoring since 1978. That's an indication of heat prevented from escaping from below.\n\nNeither the sun nor any warming source on earth can simultaneously warm the lower atmosphere while cooling the layer above it. Only a greenhouse effect can do that.

If you'd like the scientific papers that support my data, I'd be happy to let you know what they are and you can check them for yourself. \n\n1. ‚ÄúA doubling of C02 would do almost nothing.‚Äù\r\n\nAccording to all of the scientific data and the official position of the IPCC, a doubling of C02 would raise global temperature 3C, more than enough to cause disaster. That‚Äôs in the short term. Over the long term, as ice sheets melt and reduce earth‚Äôs albedo, the temperature would rise as high as 6C, according to a study led by James Hansen. That would be catastrophic.\r\r\n\n\r\r1. \"Antarctic ice is probably growing.\" \r\r\n\nJust the opposite:  Google: \"Greenland, Antarctica Melting Six Times Faster Than in the 1990s\": \n\nThose who misrepresent the data will conflate land ice with sea ice. Sea ice returns in greater or lesser extent every winter and is merely a thin veneer. It does not reflect global warming like land ice does. Deniers will point to data showing that interior snowfall in Antarctica is increasing in some areas while they ignore the much greater melting happening along the shorelines and periphery. (Or they'll cherry-pick the now-famous Zwally study from 2015, which has been thoroughly discredited by more comprehensive studies that came before and after.)\n\n\r\r\nAs for his statements about the Arctic, Google NASA TIME LAPSE VIDEO OF MELTING ARCTIC ICE.  In fact, 95% of the Arctic's oldest, thickest ice has melted. \n\n\"They said there's going to be this rapid global warming. It hasn't happened. Most of the warming was over by 1940.\" \r\r\n\nHapper apparently hasn't looked very hard. 19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. 2020 tied for first. Google any of the world's climate data centers for verification: NASA, NOAA, Berkeley Earth, the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the Hadley Met Office, etc.\n\nGlobal warming concentrates at the poles, which is why average winter temperatures in places like Barrow, Alaska and Fairbanks have risen 9.8 degrees F and 8.1 degrees F respectively since 1949. Greenland's average temperature is up 7 degrees since 1991. Google Alaska Climate Trends and see for yourself. \n\n \"We're in a C02 famine. C02 was thousands of parts per million in the Cambrian.\"\r\n\nWe're not in a C02 famine. C02 was sky high in the Cambrian because of massive tectonic upheaval from two giant land masses colliding together. That's not NORMAL. The volcanic activity spewed trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere. In addition, no land plants existed to absorb out the extra C02 from the atmosphere. \n\nFor the 800,000 years leading up to the Industrial Revolution, C02 levels remained below 300 ppm, and the planet, plants and people did just fine.\r\r Historically, C02 levels exceeding 300 ppm melt ice sheets and raise sea levels. Sea levels routinely rose dozens to over 200 feet in these C02-driven warm periods. That would be catastrophic for the millions of homes and businesses lining the world's shores today. \r\r\n\n\"C02 is beneficial for plants.\" \n\nC02 is beneficial for plants only up to a point. Like water, too much of a good thing is too much of a good thing. Google THE EARTH STOPPED GETTING GREENER 20 YEARS AGO.\nHapper won't share this but over 40% of our C02 emissions are NOT being absorbed by plants. They're simply being left behind to accumulate in the atmosphere. The reason they're not absorbing the extra C02 is because they are already SATURATED and are unable to keep up with our output. \n\nHapper also neglects to mention that while C02 is good for plants up to a point, the higher temperatures that come with that C02 are detrimental to plants, stunting their growth and even in some cases inhibiting the germination of seeds. In staple crops like rice, zinc, iron and protein content is diminished. In others, folate is lost. Some plants even lose parts of their natural defenses against insects, which devour them.

He's not just wrong about a couple of things, he's wrong about a LOT of things. \nUnfortunately this forum doesn't allow links in posts otherwise I'd put up a bunch. I can, however, direct you to CLIMATE MISINFORMATION BY SOURCE: WILLIAM HAPPER\nI'll also debunk some of his most common statements here. If you'd like the scientific papers that support my data, I'd be happy to let you know what they are and you can check them for yourself. \n\n1. ‚ÄúA doubling of C02 would do almost nothing.‚Äù\r\n\nAccording to all of the scientific data and the official position of the IPCC, a doubling of C02 would raise global temperature 3C, more than enough to cause disaster. That‚Äôs in the short term. Over the long term, as ice sheets melt and reduce earth‚Äôs albedo, the temperature would rise as high as 6C, according to a study led by James Hansen. That would be catastrophic.\r\r\n\n\r\r1. \"Antarctic ice is probably growing.\" \r\r\n\nJust the opposite:  Google: \"Greenland, Antarctica Melting Six Times Faster Than in the 1990s\": \n\nThose who misrepresent the data will conflate land ice with sea ice. Sea ice returns in greater or lesser extents every winter and is merely a thin veneer. It does not reflect global warming like land ice does. Deniers will point to data showing that interior snowfall in Antarctica is increasing in some areas while they ignore the much greater melting happening along the shorelines and periphery. (Or they'll cherry-pick the now-famous Zwally study from 2015, which has been thoroughly discredited by more comprehensive studies that came before and after.)\n\n\r\r\nAs for his statements about the Arctic, Google NASA TIME LAPSE VIDEO OF MELTING ARCTIC ICE.  In fact, 95% of the Arctic's oldest, thickest ice has melted. \n\n\"They said there's going to be this rapid global warming. It hasn't happened. Most of the warming was over by 1940.\" \r\r\n\nHapper apparently hasn't looked very hard. 19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. 2020 tied for first. Google any of the world's climate data centers for verification: NASA, NOAA, Berkeley Earth, the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the Hadley Met Office, etc.\n\nGlobal warming concentrates at the poles, which is why average winter temperatures in places like Barrow, Alaska and Fairbanks have risen 9.8 degrees F and 8.1 degrees F respectively since 1949. Greenland's average temperature is up 7 degrees since 1991. Google Alaska Climate Trends and see for yourself. \n\n \"We're in a C02 famine. C02 was thousands of parts per million in the Cambrian.\"\r\n\nWe're not in a C02 famine. C02 was sky high in the Cambrian because of massive tectonic upheaval from two giant land masses colliding together. That's not NORMAL. The volcanic activity spewed trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere. In addition, no land plants existed to absorb out the extra C02 from the atmosphere. \n\nFor the 800,000 years leading up to the Industrial Revolution, C02 levels remained below 300 ppm, and the planet, plants and people did just fine.\r\r Historically, C02 levels exceeding 300 ppm melt ice sheets and raise sea levels. Sea levels routinely rose dozens to over 200 feet in these C02-driven warm periods. That would be catastrophic for the millions of homes and businesses lining the world's shores today. \r\r\n\n\"C02 is beneficial for plants.\" \n\nC02 is beneficial for plants only up to a point. Like water, too much of a good thing is too much of a good thing. Google THE EARTH STOPPED GETTING GREENER 20 YEARS AGO.\nHapper won't share this but over 40% of our C02 emissions are NOT being absorbed by plants. They're simply being left behind to accumulate in the atmosphere. Plants aren't absorbing it because they CAN'T; they're saturated and are unable to keep up with our output.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Western economies aren't going to be strangled by converting to greener energy sources. That's fossil fuel industry propaganda. \n\nThe Chinese aren't getting a free pass. The western part of their country is so rife with solar panels and wind turbines that they produce more power than they can use, which is why they're erecting a million volt power line running from west to east.

They're not exactly sitting on their hands.\n\nKeep in mind that Americans still spew more C02 per capita (per person) than the Chinese do. Most Americans own cars. Most Chinese don't.

A single extreme precipitation event can wipe out an entire year of a farmer's crops in one fell swoop while simultaneously washing away topsoils and fertilizer. . \n\nC02-driven warming also releases methane, another powerful greenhouse gas, from pent-up permafrost and helps to increase warming still further. As the ice sheets melt, the earth's reflection of sunlight (albedo) plummets, allowing more and more open land and ocean to absorb the sun's heat. That increases warming still further. \n\nIn drier parts of the world, in areas that see few rain clouds pass, accelerated evaporation dries out vegetation and increases the incidence of drought, heatwaves and wildfires.

Since I work in science and with climate data every day, let me give you the other side of that very tired argument.\n\nIt's settled science that the earth is round, is it not? That the earth orbits the sun? That the moon orbits the earth and affects our tides? That water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen? That the rhinovirus causes colds? That bacteria evolve? That antibiotics kill bacteria? That washing hands before surgery reduces the death rates of patients? That electricity is the flow of electrons? That dinosaurs died out about 65 million years ago? That humans did not exist during the time of the dinosaurs? That the atom can be split to produce energy? That the atmosphere is mostly made up of nitrogen, oxygen and argon? That the hippocampus plays a major role in memory? That humans who evolved near the equator have darker skin? That uranium is radioactive? That blood is formed in bone marrow? That mass creates gravity? Shall I go on? \n\nEvidence isn't subjective and no amount of rhetorical gymnastics changes that. We can descend into epistemic nihilism and secede from reality, believing there is no objective truth or independent criteria for determining what is real or false, or we can believe science, an empirical, verifiable reality that validates what we believe to be true. \n\nSpectroscopic analysis clearly shows heat passing through C02 in the atmosphere and radiating back to earth. That's an empirical fact. It won't change. It also reveals that C02 levels in the atmosphere are increasing. That's an empirical fact. It won't change. Isotopic analysis shows that a substantial amount of C02 in the atmosphere came directly from the burning of fossil fuels. That's an empirical fact. It won't change. Temperature has risen as our C02 accumulation has risen. Empirical fact. The rise of C02 began around the time of the Industrial Revolution. Empirical fact. The sun's last three cycles progressively weakened, yet we continued to warm anyway. Empirical fact. Earth's orbital eccentricty, axial tilt and precession are all in cooling phases, yet we continue to warm anyway. Empirical fact. As our lower atmosphere has warmed, the atmospheric layer just above it has COOLED, according to NASA monitring since 1978. That's evidence of the heat trapped below and prevented from filtering back into space. Natural cycles can't explain why satellites measure less¬†heat¬†escaping to space at the precise wavelengths which¬†CO2¬†absorbs (Philipona 2004,¬†Wang 2009). \n\nNeither the sun nor any warming force on earth can simultaneously warm the lower atmosphere while cooling the outer one. Only a greenhouse effect can do that. \n\nThere is much in climate science that is indeed settled.

It's why high tide flooding along the American northeast coast has risen 140% in the last 20 years alone, according to NOAA. It's up an astonishing 190% along the southeast. \n\nThe term \"climate change\" has been in use in scientific journals since the 1950s. Nobody changed it from \"global warming.\" They are two different terms. Global warming denotes warming, of course. But \"climate change\" denotes warming and ALL OF ITS EFFECTS: changes in air and ocean currents, migration of the snow/rain line, intensification of hurricanes, increases in extreme precipitation events, droughts, wildfires, etc. \n\nThe amusing thing about your misinformation is that it was Republican political strategist Frank Luntz who brought the \"climate change\" term into the mainstream. In a now famous 2002 memo to Republican candidates, he warned them to never use \"global warming\" in a speech because he thought it sounded too scary. He urged them to use \"climate change\" instead. And they did. In fact, Republicans repeated \"climate change\" so often that it was quickly adopted by middle America and has ever since been in common usage.

February 1, 2018  New science sheds more light on recent controversy over how much the large carnivores are being impacted by melting sea ice. Millions have seen the heart-wrenching video of a polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. Shot by Paul Nicklen and Cristina Mittermeier of the nonprofit group Sea Legacy, and published on National Geographic in early December, the video ignited a firestorm of debate about what scientists know, and don‚Äôt know, about the impacts of global warming on polar bears. Without examining the bear in the video‚Äîthought to have died‚Äîit‚Äôs impossible to know for sure what ailed that individual, but now scientists have published new findings that shed more light on the risk to the species overall.

It's a veritable Mulligan Stew of inaccuracies, misrepresentations, lies of omission and outdated material. \n\nA few examples of updated info: Solar panels generate the energy required to build themselves in one to two years of operation, depending on the type of panel and location and their lifetime is about 30 years; large wind turbines in three to 12 months, depending on size of turbines and location, and their lifetime is 25 to 30 years,‚Äù says Associate Professor Mark Diesendorf, an energy systems and sustainability expert at the University of New South Wales. This is backed up by research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on the degradation of solar panels over time. According to NREL's data, solar panels have a median degradation rate of 0.5% per year, signifying that a median panel still produces at 90% of its capability after 20 years. In fact, most solar panels these days come with warranties of at least 20 years‚Äîtwice as long as the service life that Planet of the Humans states. \n\nAccording to Oregon State University, the average energy payback for a large wind turbine is eight months. In evaluating life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that solar PV emitted an average of 45 grams per kWh, compared to 500 grams per kWh for natural gas and 1,001 grams per kWh for coal. In reaching this finding, NREL examined 2,100 published references, subjecting them to three rounds of critical reviews by experts. \"That renewable energy generation generates the same amount of emissions as fossil fuel generation simply isn‚Äôt true: even an old meta-analysis of studies on wind farms, produced back in 2010 when turbines were far less efficient than they are now, found that an average turbine generates 20 times more energy than it takes to produce.\" ----Forbes Magazine\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists conducted a two-year study and found that electric vehicles over their lifetimes produce far fewer emisions than gasoline cars, even in states that produce some of their energy from coal. (Other studies show that they're also cheaper to own over their lifespan, due to less maintenance and fewer moving parts. According to Energy.gov, on a national average, it costs less than half as much to travel the same distance in an EV than a conventional vehicle.) Other studies, including those by the International Council for Clean Transportation and the IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute find that as of 2019, lifecycle emissions for electric cars were about 3 times lower than for conventional cars. Where batteries are produced makes a big difference. A battery produced in China, with plants powered with coal, will create far more emissions than the standard Tesla battery manufactured with renewable energy in its Nevada plant. \n\nIowa now gets 42% of its power from wind. Kansas gets 41%. Oklahoma gets 35%. The Dakotas 25%. Even Maine gets 21%. This leap forward was not a reality 20 years ago. Where will it be 20 years from now? Wind turbines in the UK now produce enough electricity to power 11.5 million homes. Denmark gets 50% of its power from wind. So does South Australia. Scotland produces twice the wind power they need to light ALL of its homes. \n\nThe video did not tell you ANY of the success stories. Instead it focused solely on outdated information. Always seek rebuttals before jumping to conclusions. \n\n‚ÄúPlanet of the Humans is wildly unscientific, outdated, full of falsehoods, and benefits fossil fuel industry promoters and climate deniers.‚Äù ---the Nation \n\nI'd love to link you to the endless rebuttals to the film but the Hillsdale College forum doesn't allow links in posts.

It didn't work out too well in Texas a few ago did it?\nWhen the Sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, you need backup. So you would need to store the energy in batteries.

If we plan to rely on them for massive amounts of storage as more renewables come online‚Äîrather than turning to a broader mix of low-carbon sources like nuclear and natural gas with carbon capture technology‚Äîwe could be headed down a dangerously unaffordable path.\"\n\nSo the only way is to keep fossil fuel energy available as a backup.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "mikeymike1001", "channel": "UC76LnoPrSH1ur4vAEkPZBPA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTXOWtYLQ_l6JLlnJtToveJsRpUKDvhyEP8f2DLhg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

ALL of their power sources froze up: oil, gas, coal, nuclear. \n\nWind turbines in Iowa don't freeze. They don't in the Dakotas or in Maine or in Denmark. That's because they're all winterized. Texas was too huffy about federal regulations to do as advised and went their own way and as a result NOTHING was winterized. The Republican theology of deregulation has placed their heads so far up in the clouds that they neglected to put in even the most trivial of safeguards. \n\nElectrical grids today tap a variety of power sources. Wind and solar are incredibly cheap sources of supplemental power. They are, in fact, the cheapest sources of energy on the planet now. No one at this juncture is expecting them to carry the entire load, although new battery technology on the horizon will be storing their energy for up to days at a time to solve the intermittency challenge.

You completely manufactured that hyperbole from your own imagination. \n\n\rThe global cooling scare of the 70s arose from a handful of scientists (not the majority, who were in fact warning about global warming even then) who worried about our ever-growing sulfate aerosol pollution problem. Sulfate aerosols, produced from burning coal, reflect sunlight and cool the planet the same way aerosols from volcanoes do. We were, in fact, in the middle of a slight cooling trend then, so the concern had some merit. \n\nBecause aerosols were also causing premature deaths and massive health and lung problems worldwide, the U.S. decided to do something and passed the Clean Air Act (1970), which significantly reduced sulfate aerosol pollution. The clean-up was so effective that climate scientists can actually mark the time period of the 70s by the absence of the aerosol pollutants in ice cores. \n\nThe long-lasting result was over $22 trillion in savings in health care, according to the EPA.

{"cid": "UgzbWvIjtLFuvIYMf0t4AaABAg", "text": "A great scientist but not a speaker. He omitted the total difference between climate and weather, and made no mention of the Earth‚Äôs magnetic shield. No mention of the forces that vary climate. The Earth‚Äôs spin, wobble, tilt and orbital shape and orbital tilt all vary in their own cycles. Milutin Milankovitch, a brilliant Serbian mathematician combined the cycles of the spin, tilt, wobble and orbital shape into one big compounded super cycle which bears his name. No mention of how the Milankovitch cycle fits our periodic ice ages when their is ice on Earth and the  much larger interglacial periods when there is no ice at all. In the very long time, our climate zones are drastically changed by continental shift (Australia is moving 1 to 3 inches a year and rotating east, separating from the plate that it shares with India). That shifting of the crust‚Äôs plates create mountains and valleys and re-locates vast land masses. Part of Canada was once equatorial. He did not explain that the climates (plural) are always changing, so the blather about stopping climate change is at best hysteria due to ignorance and at worst, lunacy or mendacity. There is no data supporting the claim that 97% of the world‚Äôs scientists agree with this horrific fraud, the number 97 was plucked out of a seminar and transmogrified into a 97% consensus. No meeting of anything in history accounted for 100% of scientists and Prof. Happer correctly said that science is not based on votes, or consensus, it is based on data correctly gathered and correctly analyzed then exposed to ruthless criticism. The dreadful thing is that due to funding pressures on universities and other science establishments gave been blackmailed into support for this fraud or loose funding and in the case of once great science journals, the fear of lost advertising revenue has turned them into a fools‚Äô chorus. We have returned to the medieval times when dogma made scientists fear for their lives. Galileo Galilea was tried for heresy, not for what he claimed,  but because what he claimed was counter to Catholic teaching when the church knew the truth very well. With its priceless library, they knew for instance that an ancient Greek measured the circumference of Earth, which was basically a sphere, and not a flat plate. Great scientists, some Nobel prize winners, have been silenced and even expelled from universities for wanting to publish or speak about the truth. The atmospheric CO2 is not uniform, it varies according to climate, topography, elevation and life activity. It does however hover around 400ppm. The good prof. touched on CO2 being plant food, but missed the opportunity to tell that modern computer controlled greenhouse agriculture pumps CO2 into the greenhouse up to 1000 to 1200 parts per million (ppm), to produce crops that are healthier, grow faster, produce more and better food and are more disease resistant. He did not reveal that the so-called hockey stick graph was simply a ‚ÄòWhat-if‚Äù graph manipulated to falsely show that CO2  levels in air rise before the temperature rises, whereas physics shows the reverse. Both oxygen and CO2 dissolve in water, nitrogen (70% of the atmospheric ) does not. If you heat water, the dissolved gasses bubble out, anyone who has watched water heated in a kitchen knows that. CO2 rises as a result of oceans heating, not the fraudulently claimed reverse. Our seas and oceans have warmer and cooler periods year round, that helps disperse the heat load as do the winds. Most of us hear from the weather channels about La Nina and El Nino cycles in the Pacific,  but there are others in the Indian ocean, up the west coast of North America, The Gulf stream with its Atlantic Conveyor and many more. Our climate is always changing, it has done so for over 4 billion years, it is due to complex cosmic and local forces beyond our control, and anyone who thinks that we can stop climates (plural!!!) from changing are either ignorant, gullible, scared or malevolent.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "P E", "channel": "UCzySW6eUMtzKLQAOse943yA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRrclQVYtSwT22rORxa_YFUVtDkWyfm77hORheDdg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes. But mainstream scientists? No. Some of these are your own misinformation and lack of research, like New York being underwater by 2019 and the Arctic free of ice by 2013, among others.\n\nAl Gore quoted several scientists, who gave RANGES when the Arctic would open, with his most famous prediction being this: A \"75% chance that the Arctic would be free of ice in SOME SUMMER MONTHS (and only in summer)\" somewhere between 2013 and 2030. See the video below. The fact is that the Arctic is melting away at rates unprecdented in recorded history and is right on track to make that prediction come true. Here's the video clip. Start at the two minute mark and listen carefully: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsioIw4bvzI\n\nAnd James Hansen was the one who allegedly said the West Side Highway would be underwater now. Only he DIDN\"T. A reporter asked him what the West Side Highway would look like in 40 years (not 20 as is popularly misquoted across the internet) IF C02 LEVELS DOUBLED.\n\n40 years have not passed and C02 levels have not doubled. However, Queens, New York is experiencing regular high tide flooding. Google it. \n\nHurricanes have, in fact, intensified, according to all the latest data, with fewer category 1 and 2 storms and more cat 4 and 5s. \n\nSince 1995 there have been 19 above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, as measured by NOAA‚Äôs Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index. ACE calculates the intensity of a hurricane season by combining the number, wind speed and duration of each tropical cyclone. That‚Äôs the largest stretch of above-normal seasons on record. So while there aren‚Äôt necessarily more Atlantic hurricanes than before, those that form are getting stronger. Here‚Äôs the cost attributable to climate change for hurricane Harvey: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-020-02692-8 HURRICANE STRENGTHENING \rhttps://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0338.1?af=R \rhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/15/scientists-link-record-breaking-hurricane-season-to-climate-crisis\n\n\r\nThe overpopulation and famine scares were promulgated by a book called the Population Bomb by Paul Erlich. Paul did not represent mainstream science. He represented himself and his desire for book sales. \n\nThe oil scares were all legitimate. We were indeed running out of oil UNTIL INDUSTRY INVENTED NEW TECHNOLOGY TO REACH OIL IN PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE LOCATIONS. \n\nI'd be more than happy to post all the data that supports this all.

{"cid": "UgzJ-1JUYYxOKcDgOM94AaABAg.9KazmxoANBa9KccN7R5NAZ", "text": "¬†@E.A. Abe Preisinger¬† I have all of Al Gore's documentaries and speeches on my laptop. Let's see how he did with his predictions:\nINCREASED WARMING: \n19 of the last 20 years were the warmest on record. 2020 is tied for first.  Record warm temperatures are now outpacing record cold ones by a 2 to 1 margin. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore \n\nHEAT CONCENTRATED TOWARD THE POLES: Average winter temperature for Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska has risen an astonishing 8 degrees F since mid 20th century. Greenland's average temperature is up 7 degrees since 1991. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore \n\nMORE EXTENSIVE HEAT WAVES: Heatwaves have increased in duration and intensity. The heatwave involving 17 countries in 2018 was the largest heat event in history. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore \n\nICECAPS AND GLACIERS WILL MELT: The Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are all melting at rates unprecedented in recorded history. So are more than 90% of the world's glaciers. In fact, the melt rate is accelerating. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore \n\nSEA LEVEL WILL RISE: According to the latest bulletin from the World Meteorological Organization, average global sea level rise over the past five years was 5mm per year, up from 4mm six years ago, 3mm in the 1990s and 1.5mm throughout most of the 20th century. It is indeed rising and it is accelerating. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore \n\nHIGH TIDE FLOODING WILL INCREASE: According to NOAA, high tide flooding along the American southeast coast has risen 190% in just 20 years. The northeast is up 140%. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore \n\nEXTREME PRECIPITATION WILL INCREASE: According to EPA statistics,  extreme downpours have risen 55% in the northeast. They've risen 30-40% in the south, midwest and northern states. Similar increases in extreme precipitation are being seen around the world. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore. \n\nHURRICANES WILL INCREASE: They actually haven‚Äôt increased but they have strengthened. Since 1995 there have been 19 above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, as measured by NOAA‚Äôs Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index. ACE calculates the intensity of a hurricane season by combining the number, wind speed and duration of each tropical cyclone. That‚Äôs the largest stretch of above-normal seasons on record. So while there aren‚Äôt necessarily more Atlantic hurricanes than before, those that form are getting stronger, with more Category 4 and 5 events. \n \nSCORE: Al Gore.\r\n\nTHE GULF STREAM WILL SLOW  The latest data shows that the Gulf Stream is clearly slowing down.\n\nSCORE: Al Gore\n\nENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS WILL INCREASE  A new report just released by the UN shows that environmental disasters over the past 20 years have nearly doubled. \n\nSCORE: Al Gore", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Happer won't call it that because as the head of the C02 Coalition he was paid by the oil industry to encourage the public to use MORE fossil fuels. You're being bamboozled by marketing. \n\nAny substance that causes environmental damage is a \"pollutant.\" C02 in EXCESS causes damage,  not only by warming the planet but by melting ice sheets, raising sea levels, intensifying hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, and increasing extreme precipitation events.\n\n\nAccording to investigations by Drexel University and the Union of Concerned Scientists, the fossil fuel industry has funded nearly 100 climate change denial organizations, front groups, PR men (like Happer) and websites. All work synergistically as part of a marketing juggernaut to sow seeds of doubt about climate change. \n\nEveryone knows C02 is good for plants, Gerald, but only up to a point. Exposed to too much C02 staple crops like rice lose substantial amounts of their zinc, iron and protein content. Others lose folate. Still others lose part of their natural defenses against insects, which devour them. C02 in optimum, balanced combinations with other nutrients is what helps plants.\n\nMost salient here is that over 40% of our yearly C02 emissions are NOT being absorbed by plants. Plants have already reached C02 saturation and are now unable to absorb our excess. That surplus is simply being left to accumulate in the atmosphere. Decade after decade. Century after century. The accumulation, alas, is the crux of our trouble. \n\nI'd be happy to give you the evidence for anthropogenically-generated warming. Just let me know.

What a surprise, eh? \n\nIt is also informative to note that the Earth's most recent Ice Age came to an end 11,000 years ago and sea levels began to rise before that.  It is also noteworthy that 97% of sea level rise, during the last 15000 years, took place before Christ was born...waaaaay before the Industrial Age and the CO2 worry began.\r\rThe Ice will come again, it always has.  And when it does 90% of the human race will perish.  Lot's of stuff grows in an industrial greenhouse  bigger than a football field.  Plants grow bigger and faster, and people work 24/7 in the high levels of C02, with no ill effects.  It is important to understand that NOTHING grows on sheets of ice hundreds of feet thick and that means death world wide..\r\rand when the ice returns, and it always has, most of the Earth's population will perish from starvation/ cold temps.\n\nNote, there is a reason that there are cities and villages scattered over the coastal sea bottoms of the world.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Richard Schaefer", "channel": "UCUF2zvg5je3ZCXaKcyjjVow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTbxKtdZ0iKytcT76X18LAFkUZVaR2WdoClVQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It‚Äôs an argument that makes sense superficially, but falls apart as soon as you start to unpack it. The land and ocean cannot absorb all the extra CO2 we are emitting. About 40% of the additional CO2 we are emitting is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, consequently, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in 10‚Äôs of thousands of years. (A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of has taken just 120 years). CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and the simple truth is greenhouse gases allow short wavelength solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere unimpeded. As the Sun warms up Earth‚Äôs surface, longer wavelength thermal radiation is reflected back into the atmosphere. Some of this thermal radiation passes into space, some of the radiation is absorbed and some is reflected back to Earth.

We were, in fact, in the middle of a slight cooling trend then, so the concern had some merit. \n\nBecause aerosols were also causing premature deaths and massive health and lung problems worldwide, the U.S. decided to do something and passed the Clean Air Act (1970), which significantly reduced sulfate aerosol pollution.

Its emissions are modulated by its planets (namely conjunctions of Saturn, Jupiter, Earth and Venus) due to the interacting gravitational effects, and also by internal mechanisms.\r\n\r\nNASA says it is able to predict sunspot numbers for the next cycle from magnetic activity of the sun hundreds of thousands of kilometres below its surface. For many years now (since at least 2010), the agency has believed that this deep activity is so weak that there may be very few sunspots in the next solar cycle (25): ‚ÄúIndeed, the sun could be on the threshold of a mini-Maunder event right now. There is evidence of a long-term weakening trend in the magnetic field strength of sunspots. Matt Penn and William Livingston of the National Solar Observatory predict that by the time Solar Cycle 25 arrives, magnetic fields on the sun will be so weak that few if any sunspots will be formed. Independent lines of research involving helioseismology and surface polar fields tend to support their conclusion‚Äù.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Mike Moodie", "channel": "UCjWMEW82MN9vnY8UFwADQOg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSsXliO8In2nyub1JI-XdfwBP-MI0C-2jgNsv5V8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It wouldn't. But no climate scientist has ever said that it would.  In fact, we know what a doubling would do. A doubling of C02 would raise global temperature by at least 3C, which is more than enough to create disaster. This is the number that IPCC scientists and the very latest data agree on.\n\nWhat Happer frequently neglects to include in his projections are the feedback effects that C02 triggers.C02-driven warming, in fact,  accelerates evaporation, which fills the atmosphere with additional water vapor which, itself a greehouse gas, then works synergistically to warm the planet more than C02 could do on its own. Methane, another powerful greenhouse gas, is also released from pent-up permafrost. Like water vapor, it works with C02 to increase warming beyond what C02 could do on its own. \n\nThese are short range temperature changes. Long range changes, by contrast, could go as high as 6C, according to a study led by James Hansen. As time goes on, more and more of the ice sheets melt, reducing sun-reflecting albedo, and exposing more land and ocean to absorb (instead of reflect) sunlight. This is, in fact, one of the most powerful synergistic warming agents to work with C02. \n\nHere are some other debunkings of Happer.

{"cid": "Ugwtn8dlRZZjWP0h-2p4AaABAg.9Ka7qvfeTQQ9KaXDooY8ni", "text": "¬†@Jim Gollagher¬† Everyone knows C02 is good for plants. But only up to a point. Like water, too much of a good thing is too much of a good thing. Numerous university studies show that higher C02 diminishes staple crops like rice and wheat of their zinc, iron and protein content. Some plants lose part of their natural defenses against insects, which devour them. Other plants lose folate. It's not as simple as it appears or as the fossil fuel industry would have you believe with their \"C02 is good for plants\" marketing blitz. \n\nAn important point to keep in mind is that the world's plants are not absorbing our excess C02. We know by isotopic analysis that over 40% of our emissions are not being absorbed by plants or other natural sinks, but are being left in the atmosphere to accumulate, year after year. If plants needed more C02, why aren't they absorbing that excess? The thinking is that they have simply reached their saturation point and can't keep up with our over-supply.\n\nA few years ago a NASA satellite surveyed a distinct new \"greening\" of the earth, which  scientists chalked up to C02 fertilization of plants. A few years later they looked at the data again and realized they had misjudged. On closer inspection, a substantial portion of that new \"greening\" was due to the planting of billions of trees by China, India and Europe. (China alone planted 66 billion trees!) \n\nNewer studies show, in fact, that the planet stopped getting greener over 20 years ago, and now the opposite is happening. Because of increasing drought and heat, plants are struggling more than before and are increasingly \"browning.\" https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-stopped-getting-greener-20-years-ago/", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

High tide flooding along the American northeast coast has risen 140% in the last 20 years. It's up 190% along the southeast, according to NOAA.\nTHEY WERE RIGHT\n4. The icecaps will melt. The Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are now melting faster than at any time in recorded history.  \nTHEY WERE RIGHT\n5. Extreme precipitation events will increase. These events are up all over the world. In the U.S. northeast, they've risen over 50%. Along the south, midwest and northern plains, they're up 30-40%. THEY WERE RIGHT\n6. The rain/snow line will migrate toward the poles. This is indeed happening as snow is increasingly turning to rain in temperate regions and spring is arriving earlier. THEY WERE RIGHT.\n7. Hurricanes will intensify. Category 1 and 2 storms have decreased while category 4 and 5s have increased. They are indeed intensifying. THEY WERE RIGHT.\n8. Natural disasters will increase.

{"cid": "Ugw4BN-48LC0Eg6qgEl4AaABAg", "text": "An excellent presentation thanks with real science, not the empirical perceptions of Michael Mann. \n\nSpending money on climate change is quixotic tilting at windmills. Carbon taxes are folly. Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I‚Äôve witnessed it with my own eyes. \n\nBorn and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe since David Livingstone, as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature‚Äôs powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth‚Äôs atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars orbits each planet with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. \n\nGlobal carbon dioxide concentration increases have been shown to lag global temperature increases which means carbon dioxide concentration cannot be the cause of temperature increases. Carbon dioxide concentration in thinly-populated agrarian Zimbabwe was not the agent of such a large climate change in the country. Global carbon dioxide concentration lagged global temperature increases because it raised ocean temperatures to expel dissolved carbon dioxide. Thus carbon dioxide concentration is to temperature, is what the police car is to road accidents. Both lag the incident. \n\nSo the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. \n\nThe first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto or paleo diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. Eat food that comes from trees and eat dairy products that come from dairy cows and goats that will improve the ground under the trees. This will not only improve your health and eliminate T2D, but more importantly it will incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soils and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. \n\nSee the best keto diet here https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ\n\nThe second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement is as follows. \n\n1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\n2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\n3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\n4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\n5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\n6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nBe positive. Be useful. Don‚Äôt be misanthropic with the debunked carbon dioxide nonsense.

The latest study (Sherwood et al) puts climate sensitivity at 3 C or slightly higher. That's in agreement with the IPCC standard asessment. 3C is more than enough to cause global disaster. \n\nWhat Happer usually neglects to do is calculate in warming's feedback effects. C02-driven warming accelerates evaporation, which fills the atmosphere with additional water vapor which then acts synergistically with C02 to raise temperatures higher than what C02 could do itself. \nMethane is also released from long pent-up permafrost which, like water vapor, works in tandem with C02 to trap even more heat and raise temperatures still further. \n\nThis is in the short range. Over the long range, climate sensitivity is even higher than 3C and possibly as high as 6C, according to a study led by James Hansen. As warming continues more and more of the ice sheets melt away, which reduces albedo and allows much greater solar insolation in the oceans and in the land which then no longer reflect sunlight but absorb it.\n\n252 million years ago high C02 from the Siberian Traps eruptions raised equatorial temperatures to 140 degrees, which caused a mass extinction event. Over 90% of marine animals and 2 out of 3 land animals died out. Ask Happer how we got to 140 degrees if C02 doesn't drive the temperature.

The new study simply narrows it down further.\n\nCosmic rays and significant climate change have no backing in the scientific data, although Svensmark and others have tried. An increase in clouds both cool the planet by reflecting more sunlight and warm it by trapping more heat. So far in the scientific data, it's a wash.  \n\nThe sun's heat output as we receive it on earth never varies by more than about a half a degree up or down, even during the grandest of minimums and maximums and over centuries of time. It is remarkably consistent. Therefore the sun has very little influence in CHANGING our climate.\nC02, on the other hand, is a much more powerful driver of CHANGE, as it traps increasingly more heat from the sun. This trapped heat concentrates at the poles, which is why average winter temperature in Fairbanks and Anchorage has risen an astonishing 8 degrees F since 1970. Greenland's average temperature is up 7 degrees just since 1991. \n\nThe sun does not and cannot do that. Only a greenhouse effect can do that. \n\nMilankovitch Cycles, of course, can bring the earth slightly closer to the sun or angle it to receive more direct sunlight over thousands of years, but all three of these cycles are in cooling phases now, not warmng ones. So scratch the sun. \n\nAs our troposphere has continued to warm, the stratosphere just above it has cooled, according to NASA satellite data since 1978. That's pretty clear evidence of heat getting trapped below.\nNeither the sun nor any warming driver on earth can simultaneously warm the troposphere while cooling the stratosphere. Only a greenhouse effect can do that. \n\nI'm not sure if you really absorbed my previous post. Doubling C02 does not double temperature or have double the effect. As I posted, doubling C02 will raise global temperature an average of 3C, which is enough to cause disaster. \n\nI don't have a bee in my bonnet about Happer, Mark. I've been a science writer since the 1970s, and I've worked with scientists all over the world, have been published in multiple languages in articles and books, and I work with climate data every day.

Humans are only responsible for 3 to 5% of CO2 emissions, the CO2 level is very low compared to 600,000,000 years ago when it was 6000 PPM, it is currently 400 PPM. Most of the carbon in the earth came from decayed vegetation, which got its carbon from the atmosphere. The quantum mechanics of the carbon cycle shows that nature is a self-regulating system and that fossil fuels are stored solar energy. -Photosynthesis (the suns energy of heat and light, EME) causes the outer electrons in the Carbon (C) atom to move to a higher level when extracted from Carbon Dioxide (CO2) combining it with water (H2O) to build its structure. A bi product of this process is oxygen (O2), which it expels into the atmosphere. The process is easily reversed with a spark. The Carbon based cellulose combines with O2, the electrons return to their original lower level, burn and expels light and heat (solar energy), CO2 and water vapour. Cycle complete.

Before humans came along, C02 was in balance with the earth's natural filtering system. We've simply upset that balance and exceeded critical mass. \n\nHigh C02 in the ancient past was always caused by massive tectonic upheaval, from the break-up of continents. This upheaval would fuel volcanic eruptions for not just days or weeks or months, but for CENTURIES. The Siberian Traps (Google it) is a prime example. 252 million years ago eruptions here continued for thousands of years, spewing trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere. That drove equatorial temperatures to 140 degrees, which caused a mass extinction event. Over 90% of all marine animals and 2 out of 3 land animals died out from the heat. \n\nHigh C02 like that is NOT NORMAL.

{"cid": "UgzFYsNugN4d3GkkbXd4AaABAg", "text": "People still think that Happer knows anything about climate? He has literally zero training in the field and is part of an extreme political organization that you can't join unless you deny science. The guy's \"work\" in the field (aka non-peer reviewed opinion pieces) have 100% been debunked and shown to be completely devoid of actual scientific data and conclusions. The sad part is the comments seem to think he actually understands the topic. As a scientist who actually has training in the field, unlike Happer, I weep for the scientific literacy of the US, but perhaps people would be willing to listen to the other side. Don't let Happer's credentials in an unrelated field sway your thinking. I'd be happy to try to explain the topic in more detail for anybody who asks. I'll explain why he gets things wrong as time goes by, but I'll just go through the first 9 or so minutes (although only about 5 or 6 are actually from him):\n\nFirst, though, one should mention that Happer is not an expert in climate. He has no training in the field. He is essentially illiterate on the topic, and his \"works\" in the field have been repeatedly debunked and called out for being below even entry level understanding by actual experts. He is also part of an extreme political organization that you can't join unless you deny all science and data regarding climate change.\n\nHe first lies and straw mans the topic. Way to go. He misunderstands what a pollutant is by trying to say CO2 can't possibly be one in any form because he literally doesn't even  understand the definition of the word \"pollutant.\" He then calls all scientific data propaganda simply because he doesn't like it.  He then lies and says he knows quite a lot about climate despite him having no training in the field. His training is in optics, which he is a great scientist in, but he does not have training in climate.\n\nHe tries to compare scientists who follow the data and are experts in the field with misled crusaders and himself and people with no training or expertise in the field as oppressed truth-seekers been attacked. He says people who support the data and are experts do it for money (despite him getting paid more to spread lies than they get to do actual research), while some do it out of a religious zeal. In other words, he makes up a story, plays the victim card while being the one attacking, straw man's the topic, lies about his opponents, ad hominem's his opponents, and pretends his lack of education gives him magic insight. \n\nThat is the first few minutes. He has provided nothing in defense of his claims or against the science. All he has done is lie and issue baseless ad hominem attacks.\n\nThe end of his first 5 minutes lands on his, again, misunderstanding of the term \"pollutant.\" Since he doesn't even understand such a simple term I'll explain it here: a pollutant is anything added to a system that causes unwanted effects. We are adding CO2 to the natural system, and it is causing unwanted effects. Thus, CO2 is, by literal definition, a pollutant with regards to AGW.\n\nReally? I can't believe a person who considers himself an expert and considers experts as people who know nothing would try to use \"but humans breathe out CO2\" so our GHG emissions are the same thing. The CO2 that living organisms exhale was already part of the biologic sphere, while our emissions of CO2 are, by definition, not. The CO2 that living organisms exhale comes from the natural CO2 in the atmosphere and the food we eat. We are essentially not adding any CO2 to the atmosphere since we are just moving it around. Us pulling up resources that were sequestered beneath the ground and outside of the natural system, however, is adding GHGs to the atmosphere and biosphere.\n\nFor instance, fill a tub with water. Now get a teaspoon and scoop some water out. This cup represents the CO2 emissions of living organisms when they breathe. Pour the water back into the tub. Have you added any water to the tub? No. All you did was put back what was already there. Now, take a different gallon jug and fill it with water from a different source. Pour that jug into the tub. Did the water level increase? Yes, because you added a source point that was not already part of the tub, the same as our GHG emissions are adding GHG's to the atmosphere.\n\nHe is either willfully spreading disinformation or is completely ignorant of the topic.

Even those who deny climate science can't deny that CO2 is causing the atmosphere to warm. That makes it a pollutant by definition.\n\nI had to write all of that to explain just the simple things he gets wrong in his start. He never even got to the science. He just simply issued false statements about what a pollutant is and analogies and baseless ad hominem attacks on other people. He is the one who keeps not getting to the science in his opening about, ostensibly, the science. If he would actually get to the science I could actually debunk him. Remember, I'm only to the 9 minute mark.\n\nHumans are not outside of the natural system. As I stated previously, we are part of it. However, we are pulling up sequestered point sources for GHG emissions. These sources were buried and not part of the active cycle. In the future they may have been, but they are not currently. That is why we are adding to the current system. Volcanic activity is part of the current system, but volcanic emissions account for roughly 1% of man's emissions.\n\nThe graph at 24:10 is simply an absorption/emission spectrum, although upside down from what some might normally see. Essentially, GHG's absorb radiation of specific frequencies. Doubling of CO2 alone would only cause a small increase, but we would actually be quintupling CO2 to get to 800 ppm. Thus the difference would be much larger. However, it isn't just CO2 we look at. We have other GHG emissions, and our emissions are causing feedback loops. Increased temperature allows for more water vapor, which can also increase atmospheric temperature. It also changes the albedo of an area, which is the amount of radiation reflected. A lower albedo allows more energy to be absorbed, and this heats the area. For example, ice has a high albedo but open water and land do not. When the ice melts it allows the area to heat up even more since more radiation can be absorbed, which can cause more ice melt. One should also note that it doesn't take much to see large impacts on the climate.\n\nHe then goes on to say that we are trying to take away rights and liberties, that we are being dictators, and the like.

That's an empirical fact. It won't change. It also reveals that C02 levels in the atmosphere are increasing. That's an empirical fact. It won't change. \n\nIsotopic analysis shows that a substantial amount of C02 in the atmosphere came directly from the burning of fossil fuels. That's an empirical fact. It won't change. \n\nTemperature has risen as our C02 accumulation has risen. Empirical fact. The rise of C02 began around the time of the Industrial Revolution. Empirical fact. The sun's last three cycles progressively weakened, yet we continued to warm anyway. Empirical fact. Earth's orbital eccentricty, axial tilt and precession are all in cooling phases, yet we continue to warm anyway. Empirical fact. \n\nAs our lower atmosphere has warmed, the atmospheric layer just above it has COOLED, according to NASA monitoring since 1978. That's evidence of the heat trapped below and prevented from filtering back into space. Natural cycles can't explain why satellites measure less¬†heat¬†escaping to space at the precise wavelengths which¬†CO2¬†absorbs (Philipona 2004,¬†Wang 2009). \n\nNeither the sun nor any warming force on earth can simultaneously warm the lower atmosphere while cooling the outer one. Only a greenhouse effect can do that. \n\nThere is much in climate science that is indeed settled. Surely new facts will be added and some information refined but these won't change the empirically-based foundation of truth the new data will rest upon.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "SwiftlyTiltingPlanet", "channel": "UCdBHd9VL3yMJ1UHp6pypZXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlWwtF0EMx33PrzsLD43nx_ICfGsNfHKy-AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxSM-niyv44gr7Ga0l4AaABAg", "text": "We are in the most alarming situation that has ever occurred in human history, but we cannot be alarmists.  \"Alarmist\" is a bad word, because we call ‚Äúalarmists‚Äù the fools and ignorants that promote Man-Made-Global-Warming.  Universities are a shame, not just the students, who maybe can be easily fooled. PhD professors and PhD researchers claiming that we all shoud go vegans because cow farts produce Global Warming and many other nonsense.  Are they idiots? Even NASA and NOOA are a real huge shame.\n\nBIG ICE AGE\nThe easiest and simplest, understandable way you can explain the BIG ICE AGE to your family, friends and to everyone you find on your way and that does not require any science background, not even basic science, is the following: \n\nMan-made-global-warming is nonsense.  CO2 is not a pollutant.  CO2 is food for plants, food for life, food for happiness.  CO2 is really good for every living thing on Earth.\n\nThe Sun manages the Earth‚Äôs climate.  The Sun creates the Earth‚Äôs climate.  \n\nAs we know, the Sun has a cycle of 11 years on average and as its activity increases, so does the number of spots on its surface.  The action of the Sun reaches the entire Solar System.  It reaches the Earth, which is mainly oceans.  There in the oceans, the Earth‚Äôs climate will finish cooking. \n\nBut the Earth has the Moon, so the action of the Sun that reaches the Earth is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.\n\nThe Moon has several cycles, of which, for now, we are interested in two of them.\nThe synodic cycle, from New Moon to New Moon and the metonic cycle. \n\nThis metonic cycle is named after Meton, a very wise guy who lived in Greece 500 years before Christ.  He realized that 235 lunations, i.e., 235 synodic cycles, were equivalent to 19 years, with an accuracy of less than two and a half hours. Very wise Meton.\n\nThis means that if on July 16, 2019 there is Full Moon, then in the year 2000 (19 years before), as well as in the year 2038 (19 years later), there is also Full Moon on July 16.\n\nThen we have a solar cycle of 11 years and we have a lunar cycle of 19 years.  If we multiply 11x19, we now have a cycle of 209 years composed of the action of the Sun and the way in which this action is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.  \n \nAt the peak of each eleven year solar cycle, its magnetic poles will exchange places. The north magnetic pole goes to the South and the south magnetic pole goes to the North.  So, the complete solar cycle is actually 22 years.\n\nAnd, then again: 22x19=418.  Two hundred years ago, the Dalton Minimum occurred and four hundred years ago the Maunder Minimum, the Little Ice Age, occurred.  As they say, we have these two trains arriving at the same time. \n\nLet's talk a little about History.  We currently use the Gregorian Calendar, a true masterpiece.  It has an error of one day every 3,333 years.  The Mayans had a slightly more precise calendar, an error of one day every 5,000 years.\nWe all understand the Gregorian Calendar.  Anyone can say how many days will it take for his next birthday or for Christmas.  The Mayan Calendar was understood only by priests.\n\nThe Mayans recorded important astronomical, political and social events on stone columns or Stelae and on the upper part of the Stela, they recorded the date of the Long Count in which the event had taken place.  The Long Count was a downward count and would have started 3,114 years before Christ, time in which, according to historians, there were no Mayans. \n\nA very clever english guy named Thompson, based solely on Stelae that recorded astronomical events, found the correlation between the Long Count and the Gregorian Calendar.  The end of the Long Count indicated the death of the Fifth Sun. \n\nThe Fifth Sun is the one we see every day flying high in the sky.  The Long Count ended on December 21, 2012.\n\nJohn Casey very accurately, almost exactly, said that the current ‚Äúsolar hibernation‚Äù had begun at the beginning of the year 2013.\n \nThe Mayans were dedicated to study Astronomy several centuries.  Because of the rudimentary nature of their methods, it is very difficult that they could reach the knowledge of the Long Count with complete accuracy.  I think this is a much older knowledge that the Mayans received and preserved. \n\nOf all the Grand Solar Minima that have occurred in the last millennia, none is comparable to the current one.  This one will be very much worse and very much longer. it will last hundreds of years. Maybe, thousands of years.\n\nWe will not enter in the future in a regular Grand Solar Minimun or in a Mini Ice Age.  Since December 21, 2012 we are in the biggest Grand Solar Minimun ever.  A real an long lasting BIG ICE AGE.\n\nValentina Zharkova, that brilliant and lovely lady, said last year that next Solar Cycle 25  will be very weak and will last only eight years.  This Cycle 25 will begin later this year or early 2020.  In her recently published paper she says: ‚ÄúSubstantial temperature decrease are expected during the grand minima ... whose magnitude can not be yet predicted‚Äù.\n\nNow NASA says that Cycle 25 will be ‚Äúthe weakest of the past 200 years‚Äù.  Yeah, finally they noticed. Good boys. It will begin in April 2020 and will last 11 years. That is OK, but NASA has been cheating everyone and playing games with the man-made-global-warming nonsense, for too many years. \n\nSo, at the beginning of year 2024, the Solar Cycle 25 will be at it's weak peak.  From now, until 2024, the climate chaos will be growing faster and faster.  After that, we will be in a free fall, going deeper into the BIG ICE AGE.\n\nI want to analyze the effects of the other Moon cycles.  The anomalistic cycle, from apogee to apogee, wich precesses and makes a complete round in 08.75 years and the draconic cycle, that involves the ascending and descending lunar nodes, which precesses and takes 18.60 years to make a complete round. \n\nMore at: manuelesbri.com", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Manuel Esbri", "channel": "UCZM34jVSbunBJ1V4X6VfwvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRuMTMhaIy6Oy67tyRudfzZz7aQr9OIbWH02rNdg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugy3IMJaWSybgFT5XZx4AaABAg", "text": "Estamos en la situaci√≥n m√°s terrible y alarmante que jam√°s haya ocurrido en la historia humana, pero no podemos ser alarmistas.  \"Alarmista\" es una mala palabra, porque llamamos \"alarmistas\" a los tontos e ignorantes y criminales que promueven el disparate del calentamiento global provocado por el hombre.  Las universidades son una l√°stima, no s√≥lo los estudiantes, que tal vez puedan ser enga√±ados f√°cilmente.  Profesores con doctorados e investigadores con doctorados que afirman que todos debemos volvernos veganos porque los pedos de las vacas producen Calentamiento Global y muchas otras tarugadas. Son idiotas?  Incluso NASA y NOOA son una verdadera verg√ºenza.\n\n GRAN ERA DE HIELO\nLa forma m√°s sencilla y m√°s f√°cil de entender para poder explicar la GRAN ERA DE HIELO a tu familia, amigos y todas las personas que encuentres en tu camino y que no requiere conocimientos cient√≠ficos, ni siquiera ciencia b√°sica, es la siguiente:\n\nEl calentamiento global causado por el hombre no tiene sentido, es un disparate.  \nEl CO2 no es un contaminante.  El CO2 es alimento para las plantas, alimento para la vida, alimento para la felicidad.  El CO2 es realmente bueno para todos los seres vivos en la Tierra.\n¬† \nEl Sol maneja el clima de la Tierra.  El Sol crea el clima de la Tierra.\n\nComo sabemos, el Sol tiene un ciclo de 11 a√±os en promedio y a medida que aumenta su actividad, tambi√©n aumenta el n√∫mero de manchas en su superficie.  La acci√≥n del Sol llega a todo el Sistema Solar.  Llega a la Tierra, que es principalmente oc√©anos.  Ah√≠ en los oc√©anos, terminar√° de cocinarse el clima de la Tierra. \n\nPero la Tierra tiene a la Luna, as√≠ que la acci√≥n del Sol que llega a la Tierra es modificada y modulada por la presencia de la Luna.\n\nLa Luna tiene varios ciclos, de los cuales, por ahora, estamos interesados ‚Äã‚Äãen dos de ellos.  El ciclo sin√≥dico, de Luna Nueva a Luna Nueva y el ciclo met√≥nico.\n\nEste ciclo met√≥nico se llama as√≠ en honor a Met√≥n, un tipo muy sabio que vivi√≥ en Grecia 500 a√±os antes de Cristo.  Met√≥n se di√≥ cuenta de que 235 lunaciones, es decir, 235 ciclos sin√≥dicos, eran equivalentes a 19 a√±os, con una precisi√≥n de menos de dos horas y media. Bien sabio Met√≥n.\n\nEsto significa que si en Julio 16 de 2019 hay Luna Llena, entonces en el a√±o 2000 (19 a√±os antes), as√≠ como en el a√±o 2038 (19 a√±os despu√©s), tambi√©n hay Luna Llena en Julio 16.\n\nEntonces tenemos un ciclo solar de 11 a√±os y tenemos un ciclo lunar de 19 a√±os.  Si multiplicamos 11x19, ahora tenemos un ciclo de 209 a√±os compuesto por la acci√≥n del Sol y la forma en que esta acci√≥n es modificada y modulada por la presencia de la Luna. \n\nEn el punto m√°ximo de cada ciclo solar de once a√±os, los polos magn√©ticos del Sol intercambian lugares. El polo magn√©tico norte se va al Sur y el polo magn√©tico sur se va al Norte.  Entonces, el ciclo completo del Sol es, en realidad, de 22 a√±os.\n\nY, nuevamente: 22x19=418. Hace doscientos a√±os, ocurri√≥ el M√≠nimo de Dalton y hace cuatrocientos a√±os ocurri√≥ el M√≠nimo de Maunder, la Peque√±a Era de Hielo.  Como dicen, tenemos estos dos trenes que llegan al mismo tiempo.\n\nHablemos un poco de Historia.  Actualmente usamos el Calendario Gregoriano, una verdadera obra maestra.  Tiene un error de un d√≠a cada 3,333 a√±os.  Los Mayas ten√≠an un calendario un poco m√°s preciso, un error de un d√≠a cada 5,000 a√±os.\n\nTodos entendemos el Calendario Gregoriano.  Cualquiera puede decir cu√°ntos d√≠as faltan para su pr√≥ximo cumplea√±os o para Navidad.  El Calendario Maya √∫nicamente lo entend√≠an los sacerdotes.\n\nLos Mayas registraban los eventos astron√≥micos, pol√≠ticos y sociales importantes en columnas de piedra o Estelas y en la parte superior de la Estela, grababan la fecha de la Cuenta Larga en la que tuvo lugar el evento.  La Cuenta Larga era una cuenta descendente y habr√≠a comenzado 3,114 a√±os antes de Cristo, tiempo en el cual, seg√∫n los historiadores, no hab√≠a Mayas.\n\nUn tipo ingl√©s muy listo llamado Thompson, bas√°ndose √∫nicamente en Estelas que registraron eventos astron√≥micos, encontr√≥ la correlaci√≥n entre la Cuenta Larga y el Calendario Gregoriano.  El final de la Cuenta Larga indicaba la muerte del Quinto Sol.      \n\nEl Quinto Sol es el que vemos todos los d√≠as volando alto en el cielo.  La Cuenta Larga termin√≥ el 21 de Diciembre de 2012.\n\nJohn Casey dijo con mucha precisi√≥n, casi exactamente, que la ‚Äúhibernaci√≥n solar‚Äù actual hab√≠a comenzado a principios del a√±o 2013.\n\nLos Mayas se dedicaron a estudiar Astronom√≠a durante varios siglos.  Debido\na la naturaleza rudimentaria de sus m√©todos, es muy dif√≠cil que pudieran alcanzar el conocimiento de la Cuenta Larga con total precisi√≥n.  Creo que este es un conocimiento mucho m√°s antiguo que los Mayas recibieron y preservaron.\n\nDe todos los Grandes M√≠nimos Solares que han ocurrido en los √∫ltimos milenios, ninguno es comparable al actual.  Este ser√° mucho peor y mucho m√°s largo. Durar√° cientos de a√±os. Tal vez, miles de a√±os.\n\nNo entraremos en el futuro en un Gran M√≠nimo Solar com√∫n y corriente o en una Mini Era de Hielo.  Desde el 21 de Diciembre de 2012 estamos en el mayor Gran M√≠nimo Solar de los √∫ltimos tiempos.  Una verdadera y duradera GRAN ERA DE HIELO.\n\nValentina Zharkova, esa encantadora y brillante dama, dijo el a√±o pasado que el pr√≥ximo Ciclo Solar 25 ser√° muy d√©bil y durar√° s√≥lo ocho a√±os.  Este Ciclo Solar 25 empezar√° a finales de este a√±o o principios de 2020.  En su art√≠culo recientemente publicado, dice: \"Se espera una disminuci√≥n sustancial de la temperatura durante los  grandes m√≠nimos ... cuya magnitud a√∫n no se puede predecir\". \n¬†\nAhora la NASA dice que el Ciclo Solar 25 ser√°: ‚Äúel m√°s d√©bil de los √∫ltimos 200 a√±os‚Äù.  S√≠, claro.  Apenas se dieron cuenta.  Muchachos est√°n aprendiendo.  Empezar√° en Abril de 2020  y durar√° 11 a√±os. Est√° bien, pero la NASA ha estado enga√±ando a todos y jugando juegos con el disparate del calentamiento global causado por el hombre, durante muchos a√±os. \n\nEntonces, a principios del a√±o 2024, el Ciclo Solar 25 estar√° en su d√©bil punto m√°s alto.  A partir de ahora, hasta 2024, el caos clim√°tico crecer√° cada vez m√°s r√°pido.  Despu√©s de eso, estaremos en ca√≠da libre, profundizando en la GRAN ERA DE HIELO.\n\nQuiero analizar los efectos de los otros ciclos de la Luna.  El ciclo anomal√≠stico, de apogeo a apogeo que, por precesi√≥n, completa una vuelta en 08.75 a√±os y el ciclo drac√≥nico, que involucra los nodos lunares ascendente y descendente y que, por precesi√≥n, completa una vuelta en 18.60 a√±os.\nM√°s en: manuelesbri.com", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Manuel Esbri", "channel": "UCZM34jVSbunBJ1V4X6VfwvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRuMTMhaIy6Oy67tyRudfzZz7aQr9OIbWH02rNdg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The Siberian Traps, for example, triggered volcanic eruptions that continued for centuries, spewing trillions of tons of C02 into the atmosphere. 250 million years ago, this C02 drove equatorial temperatures to 140 degrees and caused a mass extinction event known as the \"Great Dying.\" (Google it) Over 90% of all marine animals and 2 out of 3 land animals died out from the heat. \n\nSuper high C02 like that IS NOT NORMAL. It drives temperature high enough to melt the icecaps. The last time that happened, in the dinosaur days, the land we now know as Canada and the United States was flooded with a new ocean called the Western Interior Seaway, which remained for millions of years. It's why we find the fossils of sea creatures in Kansas. \n\nHigh C02 is not benign, and Happer is disingenuous when he says it is.

Either way, it's not heat. NASA is part of the insidious U.N. IPCC that is trying to bilk $150 trillion to save the world from CO2 radiation,  which can't melt an ice cube. The stratosphere is cooling? Who cares? We live on the surface at the bottom of the troposphere.

All photons are not equal. They have energy, and because of Planck's Radiation Law, temperature. Water vapor and methane are powerful what?

It also reduces your liability and need to explain yourselves so you can blame humans all you want, but you don't have to take any responsibility for if the \"climate changes\".

And as we know with the corrupt Democrats and big tech, all you guys do is level accusations repeatedly with absolutely no proof to back up your claims.  Yet you'll silence those that speak the truth, like about how the election was stolen, and that there was MASSIVE voter fraud that took place, but hey, anyone who speaks out against it is silenced by you guys.  What about all of the claims from others on youtube in the past that claim that President Trump stole the election?  What about those claims?

{"cid": "Ugx5wMH8W4gBtKFuxkx4AaABAg", "text": "HOW TO  REALLY  THINK OF CLIMATE CHANGE:\n\nQuestioner: Will we see more changes in our environment and our effect upon our environment?\n\nRa: I am Ra. The fourth density is a vibrational spectrum. Your time/space continuum has spiraled your planetary sphere and your, what we would call galaxy, what you call star, into this vibration. This will cause the planetary sphere itself to electromagnetically realign its vortices of reception of the in-streaming of cosmic forces expressing themselves as vibrational webs so that the Earth thus be fourth-density magnetized, as you may call it.\n\nThis is going to occur with some inconvenience, as we have said before, due to the energies of the thought-forms of your peoples which disturb the orderly constructs of energy patterns within your Earth spirals of energy which increases entropy and unusable heat. This will cause your planetary sphere to have some ruptures in its outer garment while making itself appropriately magnetized for fourth density. This is the planetary adjustment.\n\nThere will also be a sharp increase in the short run of negatively oriented or polarized mind/body/spirit complexes and social complexes, due to the polarizing conditions of the sharp delineation between fourth-density characteristics and third-density self-service orientation.\n\nThose who remain in fourth density upon this plane will be of the so-called positive orientation. Many will come from elsewhere, for it would appear that with all the best efforts of the Confederation, which includes those from your peoples‚Äô inner planes, inner civilizations, and those from other dimensions, the harvest will still be much less than this planetary sphere is capable of comfortably supporting in service.\n\nQuestioner: ... It has occurred to me that I really do not understand why unusable heat is generated as our Earth moves from third into fourth density. I know it has to do with disharmony between the vibrations of third and fourth density but why this would show up as a physical heating within the Earth is beyond me. Can you enlighten me on that?\n\nRa: I am Ra. The concepts are somewhat difficult to penetrate in your language. However, we shall attempt to speak to the subject. If an entity is not in harmony with its circumstances it feels a burning within. The temperature of the physical vehicle does not yet rise, only the heat of the temper or the tears, as we may describe this disharmony. However, if an entity persists for a long period of your space/time in feeling this emotive heat and disharmony, the entire body complex will begin to resonate to this disharmony, and the disharmony will then show up as the cancer or other degenerative distortions from what you call health.\n\nWhen an entire planetary system of peoples and cultures repeatedly experiences disharmony on a great scale the earth under the feet of these entities shall begin to resonate with this disharmony. Due to the nature of the physical vehicle, disharmony shows up as a blockage of growth or an uncontrolled growth since the primary function of a mind/body/spirit complex‚Äôs bodily complex is growth and maintenance. In the case of your planet the purpose of the planet is the maintenance of orbit and the proper location or orientation with regards to other cosmic influences. In order to have this occurring properly the interior of your sphere is hot in your physical terms. Thus instead of uncontrolled growth you begin to experience uncontrolled heat and its expansive consequences.\n\nLaw of One Ra Material (1982)", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "An Humble Messenger of the Law of One", "channel": "UC75jmBSdeVEcgdyCnw13ufw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTBToIXh8D0xsWLTlrPmoUYq3KFZhcpYm0P8zbT8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwS5fMJZgc0LLZeNBp4AaABAg", "text": "From 2:26 to 7:40 (a bunch of unfounded claims that the climate movement is analagous to a crusade). @ 7:42 Happer shows a picture of real air pollution in Shanghai pointing out that it is not CO2, CH4 or N2O that you can see. I find this strange when this strange when the recommended levels of indoor CO2 is to keep it below 1000ppm, when humans are responsible for having lifted CO2 levels on a global scale from about 280ppm to 415ppm. High CO2 concentrations make the room fill stuffy and affect our ability to think according to studies. Why is Mr. Happer then trying to say that CO2 is not a pollutant? @ 9:10 Mr. Happer seems to make a big deal about that we humans contribute CO2 to the atmosphere just by breathing to point that it is not a pollutant because it is natural or because we contribute to its the atmosheres CO2. But this is a warped argument, because he is neglecting the other half of the story which is that our bodies take in carbon when we eat food! Think about it. If we weigh the same all the time, then the net effect is that we always store the same amount of carbon in our bodies. The carbon that enters our bodies has to be balanced with the carbon that leaves our bodies. So our mere existence is not contributing to the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere! In an airtight room you would eventually die from CO2 poisoning.  @ 10:48 Happer says \"We've just seen how well solar farms and wind mills don't work in Texas\". The majority of Texas' electricity failures was due to gas pipelines failing because they were no winterized as was recommended to do. They didn't winterize their wind mills or solar farms either. This comment seems unscientific and propogandistic in nature. @11:30 Happer decries subsidies for Wind and Solar power but fails to mention that fossil fuels are subsidized at a much larger level and decries these subsidies as a way to steal from the poor and give to the rich. Strange. @27:49 Mr. Happer shows a graph claiming that it shows that the effects of absorbption of thermal radiation by the atmosphere with a doubling of CO2 would be indistinguishable from not doing it (going from 400ppm to 800ppm). This is misleading because this graph does not account for other effects which explain why a doubling in CO2 causes an increase in absorption of thermal radiation in watts per square meter and hence a warming of about 1 degrees C if feedback effects are not included and about 3.5 degrees C of warming if feedback effects are included; it turns out that the velocity of CO2 can cause a shift in the wavelengths of radiation they aborb (not shown in the graph). If you account for this shift and feedback effects you get the usual relationship between global temperatrue increase and an increase in CO2 concentration in accordance with the equation deltaT=5.35*(ln(C)/ln(C_0), where C_0, C and deltaT are respectively, start concentration of CO2 in the atmpshere, end concentration of CO2 and increase in global average surface temperature. @ 30:30. Ask yourself why Mr. Happer decided to cherry pick the time period 1993-2012 when the oceans happen to be responsible for absorbing large amounts of heat from the atmosphere in order to generate this graph?  Why not look at what happened in 2010-2020? I am out of time.

{"cid": "Ugw3eXh1P4pFfw41Sul4AaABAg", "text": "Let's first look at this from incoming light. The Sun, with an effective temperature of approximately 5800 K, is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the visible spectrum. Of that, about 55% of incoming sunlight to Earth is infrared photons. They strike the Earth and are reradiated back out into the atmosphere. The other 45% is white light and of that, about 30% is reflected which is what you would see if you were to look at the Earth from outer space. That should leave about 31.5% of the total light being white, to strike the Earth and be reradiated in the Earth's black body 255k infrared range back into the atmosphere. That would mean 55% of infrared photons coming in and 86.5% of total infrared photons going out. As we increase secondary greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, O3, N2O, CFCs, and HCFCs, in the atmosphere, we block more incoming infrared photons, slightly cooling off the planet.   In addition, some incoming white light is converted into kinetic energy (heat), in the atmosphere by the secondary greenhouse gases before reaching the planet.  Being there are more outgoing infrared photons than incoming, we should trap more outgoing infrared photons than reflecting incoming photons. That being said, all things being equal, on the mean, the planet must heat.\r\nhttps://phys.org/news/2021-01-holocene-temperature-affirms-role-greenhouse.html\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let us look at this from the secondary greenhouse gas CO2.  One of CO2's properties is it has a reactive band in the 255K range where it absorbs and releases infrared photons in Earth's black body radiation range. Once released after absorption, there is one chance in 41,253 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate a body of water's surface, but will instead excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas that prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon, -18C on the mean. Consequently, the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 46% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity. The present increase in temperature due to this combination of additional H2O and CO2 with over a doubling of CH4, in the atmosphere is approximately 1.2C. Because it takes a tremendous amount of time for the oceans to heat, it will take centuries for the Earth to reach temperature equilibrium. If we continue to inject 37 gigatonnes annually of CO2 into the atmosphere, that heating process will continue to accelerate.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "EF M", "channel": "UCU3EvuNPCpCXcnkJyF2fcvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTsvFNW4B0obIA88tJKWbyrPS1BtLLzvF9iaA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

He makes the case for developed countires to reduce their emissions (responsibly, mainly through nuclear and not through solar or wind to which I strongly agree with) while the developing countires can use fossil fuels to simply get out of poverty and then transition to greener fuels. \n\nThe idea behind it is to not trade emission reductions in developed countries with emissions gains in developing countries. Ideally this produces minimal to no acceleration of co2 emissions while simultaneously bringing vast parts of the world out of poverty. \n\nOnce that is achieved, the idea is to responsibly reduce emissions on a global scale. In this scenario there is a potential for warming beyond what could be done under drastic measures that the IPCC likes to being forth, but it is also increasing prosperity so the tradeoff may be worth while. \n\nFinally, I think most people can agree that fossil fuels (especially coal power plants) are not the best way to produce energy. They cause massive amount of pollutants (this videos assessment of gobi desert dust in Shanghai as air pollution is a red herring, it is irrelevant because it is both that and air pollution, while many places see pollution from fossil fuels on massive scales), are inefficient, and if the costs are averaged over their lifetimes, are extremely expensive. A coal plant, for example, is cheap to build but expensive to operate. This makes it over the course of it's like far more expensive than a comparable nuclear, hydro, or even in some cases wind farms (obviously this varies depending on the site)\n\nShellenbergers argument is that yes, there is climate extremism, but that climate change is still an issue worth attention.

Renewables have their problems, for sure, but they were not responsible for the texas power outages as was incorrectly pointed out in this video. Every type of power production was responsible and natural gas was responsible for more power outages than any other form of energy in that situation. Solar and wind certainly have their place but they are not always applicable. What frustrates me is when it is ignored that they can be useful in certain circumstances.

Of everyone had that attitude about everything, humans would still be living in caves. Even in the case of nuclear today that is the case. Nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build and are becoming increasingly non-competitive. But the onset of next generation nuclear could change that dramatically. Simply put, progress requires hope. And as I stated previously, in some circumstances renewables are already cost competitive. Therefore it is not a \"pie in the sky\" but simply something that takes time to integrate through society. \n\nI think if you do more unbiased independent research on the competitiveness of renewables you will find (as I have) that they are not a pie in the sky but are instead now coming out of the oven. \n\nKeep in mind that like electric cars, wind and solar Technology is not a new idea. It has been attempted before and failed before. But now it is coming into the light because we finally have the technical capacity to make it work. I do not advocate for solar because of the problems it can create, but I still see that it can be useful in certain situations.

Oceans,lakes and rivers are a dynamic systems. Long term studies tend to sample from the same areas over a period of many years even as water contidtions change so itispossible that species are now in new places that are notbeing sampled. The real question is whether the Gray is suffering because the nutrients they rely upon have moved and the whales' migratory patterns haven't changed so nutricious foods are no longer avaiable intheir traditional haunts. BTW what kind of radiation are you talking about? It would have to be ingested particulate radition to have any impact at all. Areyou suggesting that radiation poisoning is playing a part?

I think if you look at the evidence and try to not dismiss the facts but lay aside the screaming extremists then we can get to the heart of the matter. I like to look at both sides and decide. In the 70's the \"experts\" were calling for an ice age. My geography teacher said it was nonsense. When you see the pollution that is around now that we have so many more cameras it looks scary indeed. I hate seeing scientists conspire to create a hockey stick temperature graph and then lie about it. We can see the temperatures have not increased as much as the models suggest and that is something scientists have to deal with truthfully.

Read the story he told about how a man who hired a man to do a job early in the morning. He offered the man a certain amount of money. As the day wore on, he hired more & more - giving them all the same wage. At the end of the day - the last hour, he hired one more person &, according to his promise, he paid him the same wage as all the rest. When the day was over, the man he hired at the beginning of the day complained that the last man hired shouldn't be getting the same amount of wages as he received for working all day whereas the last man hired only worked for an hour. Jesus went on to say the man who hired everyone, told the man, \"Did I not agree to pay you a certain wage & you agreed to it?\" The man responded by agreeing. The hirer went further to say, \"Then what is it to you what I paid anyone else? You agreed to the wage offered & so did the last man hired.\" In other words, the man who was hired first didn't have to agree with the wage - he didn't have to work for him. That it was his choice. THIS is what Capitalism & the free market is. Someone hires you to do a job & pays you what THEY think you are worth, and YOU have to decide whether or not to do the job for the amount offered. This is the free market! Jesus was ANYTHING but a socialist. He believed in a man working for his fruits. He did NOT believe in forcefully spreading the wealth around. There is a HUGE difference between WILLINGLY giving someone something out of the goodness of your heart because you CHOOSE to, & government breathing down your neck to FORCE you to give someone else something you may not want to give or feel obligated to give. Also, charities diminish greatly, when government FORCES people into submission by making them part with what is theirs to give to others who haven't worked for it. - Susan Burns", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "DeeAnn Ray", "channel": "UCsSwoKpWguqPJwn_ua4rNaw", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaf2v1INnxSj4-RRR3Gu9hHjBZk-qLVKqn3A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And the money that banks create goes to the elite first. So you have no choice but to work for those the banks selected.\n\nJesus forbade usury which is the practice of charging interest for money. The banking system are pretty much using ususery. Look up fractional reserve banking.\n The reason why we must grow the economy and grow the population with immigrants if need be is because the compound interest is creating exponentially more debt. You can never pay it off or stop it from growing. Jesus forbade the practice but it is the defining feature capitalism. This endless money is the capital in capitalism.

In \"The Secret Doctrine\" Blavatsky writes: \"In this case it is but natural ... to view Satan, the Serpent of Genesis as the real creator and benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind.\"\n\n\"For it is he who was the \"Harbinger of Light,\" bright radiant Lucifer, who opened the eyes of automaton (Adam) created by Jehovah, as alleged; and he who was first to whisper, \"In the day yea eat there of, ye shall be as Elohim, knowing good and evil\" -- can only be regarded in the light of a Saviour. An \"adversary\" to Jehovah ... he still remains in esoteric truth the ever-loving \"Messenger\"... who conferred on us spiritual instead of physical immortality ...\n\nSatan, or Lucifer, represents the active ... \"Centrifugal Energy of the Universe\" in a cosmic sense ... Fitly is he ... and his adherents ... consigned to the \"sea of fire,\" because it is the Sun ... the fount of life in our system, where they are petrified ... and churned up to re-arrange them for another life; that Sun which, as the origin of the active principle of our Earth, is at once the Home and the Source of the Mundane Satan... \" http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NewAge/Lucis_Trust.htm\n\n\"New Agers generally do not openly repudiate Christianity,\" Cumbey writes. \"They redefine Christ to give pagan Gods equal time, and expand the definition of Christ to be the integral essence of themselves.\" (146)\n\nWhile New Agers \"would rightfully picket to prevent a Nazi demonstration, they fail to see that point-for-point the program of the New Age Movement has complete identity with the programs of Hitler.\" (56, Cumbey does the point-by-point comparison on pp.114-120)\n\n\"New Agers\" profess a great love of peace and disarmament but Cumbey cites Bailey saying nuclear weapons will be the preserve of the United Nations for \"threatened use when aggressive action on the part of any nation rears its ugly head.\" (70)\n\nSimilarly, the environment and world hunger causes all have a hidden elite agenda. Cumbey writes that supporters of anti-hunger programs are urged to back measures for abortion, artificial insemination, forced limitation of family size, genetic control and even death control.\" (56)\n\nBuffett said Monday \"that he was a student of many of the same philanthropists that Gates modeled himself on - the oilman John D. Rockefeller, and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie.\"\n\nThese \"philanthropists\" have used their tax-exempt money to subvert Western Civilization for almost a century. For example, a Rockefeller boasted to Aaron Russo that they started feminism to get women into the workplace paying taxes on the debt, while they indoctrinate the young in daycares. Significantly, another focus of the Gates Foundation is \"improving American high schools.\"\n\nThey are on the forefront of destroying traditional cultures by breaking up the family. They are championing \"women's rights\" through loans mainly to women to make them independent of men.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWestern civilization has been subverted by an organized Satanic power. As I explain elsewhere (http://www.savethemales.ca/001297.html,) this cult is sponsored by the central banking cartel that must enslave mankind in order to consolidate its monopoly on our credit. The credit check of the future might inquire into our religious and political views.\n\nObviously, like the war on poverty or the war on drugs, Gates' war on disease will not be effective and may even advance the real depopulation goals of the nwo. But alot of other people will be enriched by the process and won over to the nwo.\n\nI prided myself on having escaped the banker's Communist hoax (http://www.savethemales.ca/160303.html) but I realize now that Communism was the \"plan\" for my parent's generation. I fell hook-line-and-sinker for the \"New Age\", which was aimed at my generation. It is exactly like Communism, appealing to our idealism, but having an insidious hidden agenda.\n\nI still believe some drug experiences can open the door to mysticism and religious knowledge.

This in the wake of various cosmic impact events¬†during the rather brief current¬†biological age, now thought to have commenced around 300ka.¬†\nPrincipally around the periods 70ka (Sholz's star/Toba eruption) and 12.8ka (Younger Dryas) which resulted in cataclysmic¬†events for whatever megafauna was around at the time and also the brief reversal of the magnetosphere around 42ka where again megafauna was fragged from the sky/atmosphere.\nI'll send a follow up about why this understanding could be so important now, but (spoiler alert) it harks¬†to another pending stadial/flood event resulting from a calving of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which will then oscillate with various, already critical Antarctic ice sheets (teleconnections) bringing about another stadial/flood event. Nothing as severe as the meltwater pulses associated with the Younger Dryas period, given the lower baseline of ice to start with, but still enough to warrant the term cataclysmic and possibly game ending given the current complexity & concentration in our present settled living arrangements.¬†---------------------------------------\nWhy do monotheistic religions (choose any) with their associated language, architecture, symbolism and ceremony, catalogue an intense and ancient interest in observing and recording the dimensions of the earth, moon and sun along with relative celestial movements?\n¬†Randall Carlson shows that ancient master builders understood earth's fundamental geodetic parameters on a level not equaled until the advent of modern satellite surveys. The great pyramid of Kheops on the Giza plateau is essentially a scale model of the northern hemisphere of earth at a ratio of 1:43,200. Over 2 seconds of time (1/43,200th part of the diurnal rotation) a point on the equator will travel a distance precisely equal to the perimeter of the great pyramids base as measured with the socle. In a 1/2 second of time, a point on the equator will rotate a distance equal to 1 side of the base of the great pyramid as measured with the socle. Its height when measured with the socle is 1/432,000th part of the earth's polar radius.¬†This geodetic knowledge was passed on through time and cultures and similarly encoded within the Parthenon in Greece. Such traditions are continued into more recent times. Gothic cathedrals are typically built with their cubit dimensions based upon a subdivision of the meridian length at the latitude that the cathedral was built. Many other examples exist across cultures, some going very far back. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oyZGW99os&list=LL&index=28&t=32s).¬†Sky - Ground mirroring, i.e. lining up complex architectural structures with celestial objects goes back a long, long way.¬† Moreover, the importance of many of these architectural structures, for example; the Giza pyramids, Machu Picchu, Easter Island, Angkor Wat, Mohenjo-Daro, and many others, in their relationship to the Sun and other celestial objects can be further demonstrated by their alignment along a newly recognized type of Earth orbit that can travel directly above a great circle formed by some of these oldest and most distinctive ancient human constructions on the surface of the Earth¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HytJn6uaRk&list=LLdBbaEuuXa8HPX0fskUQuEA&index=82¬†Roger G. Gilbertson gives a great lecture on this here, again evidencing how the human DNA profile dropped, precipitously off a cliff from around 13,000 years ago - aligning with the Younger Dryas cosmic event and subsequent cooling. This is clear evidence of sophisticated civilizations with skills in stonework (in many cases beyond those present today), astronomy, language with deeply held religious/spiritual practices involving celestial worship. It also calls into question orthodox timelines for civilizational development when taking into account the precession of the equinoxes over time and the relative change in positions of constellations in the night sky.¬†Here, Graham Hancock asks; Was an advanced civilization lost to history in the global cataclysm that ended the last Ice Age? His research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientific rebels responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs. In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rainforest, he reveals that ancient ‚ÄòNew World‚Äô cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected ‚ÄòOld World‚Äô cultures.¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAccZ8eWhXo&list=LLdBbaEuuXa8HPX0fskUQuEA&index=60&t=0s¬†¬†The astronomical math itself needed to create these structures would have taken several generations to develop, monitoring and accurately measuring small movements over long timeframes; 72 years equating to 1 day of the astrological or 'great' year of the precession of the equinoxes, i.e. only degree of movement.¬†So, thousands of years ago the earth's dimensions were surveyed with remarkable accuracy and the data was recorded in giant stone structures along with other key astronomical measurements. The astronomical math used to obtain this geodetic knowledge and understanding relies on patterns of so-called sacred numbers, which are similarly incorporated into the mythology/texts of the various mono-theistic religions and likewise of those going back over 5000+ years.¬†Here's some more examples from Randall Carlson (of which there are reportedly many hundreds):", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Alex Gullen", "channel": "UCdBbaEuuXa8HPX0fskUQuEA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRdxuCf8VbTWrkkHWs5qpMU65gJoQfoBFVzaJNjKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgzNcNwCSBJgfUkJyrx4AaABAg.9KOUXm9ZX4x9Kjt3kq4ixJ", "text": "In ancient Greek, the word truth has numbers (its gematria) 72, 7+2 = 9 Other examples are, Jerusalem = 864 which reduces again to 9, Temple of Immortality =864 again, The Holy Ghost = 1,080 (reduces to 9). Revelation 14:1-4 references 'hundred and forty four thousand' which reduces to 9, Revelation 18;4 references 'come out my people' which = 1,296, which reduces to 9. Revelation 13:18 references 'six hundred threescore and six' which relates to earth's orbital speed around the sun 66,600 mph. See also Zacharia 2:1-2, Revelation 21¬†The gematria (study of the numerical basis of language) of religious texts is based on the same architecture of numbers used in geodetic calculations that used astronomical measurements, not by any co-incidence.¬†Whichever religion, whether it involves for instance central characters like Jesus or his depictions from earlier mythologies, i.e. Mithras, Zeus, Osiris or even Krishna (in that order);- they all derive from and encode ancient astronomy relating to the relative positions and movement of the shapes and names of constellations in the sky, planets, moons and obviously the center of it all - the sun. This is further echoed in language, architecture (with embedded mathematics) dating as early as 12,000+ years ago (Gobekli Tepe), symbolism and ceremony, even down to use of body language - the penitent monk praying echoing 5000+ year old Vedic yoga. These themes even echo in popular culture now via the storytelling medium of film.¬†The word God itself provides a useful example of linguistic and other development around source astronomy. The etymology is old English/Germanic in origin. In Germanic it was Goth, which gives us Gothic architecture, or Gut in Scandinavia, which gives you a gut instinct or to follow your gut, i.e. a divine instinct or wisdom. Or back further still, it is Dog (God backwards) because if you go back to Ancient Greece, it stems from the importance assigned to the Sirius Star within the Canis Major system, known as the Dog-Star, i.e. the brightest star in the night sky. Back even further and it gives rise to the most powerful ancient Egyptian deity, Osiris (derivative of Sirius) who ruled over the celestial afterlife the Duat. Sirius leading to the word 'Sir', i.e. someone you typically salute or look up to.¬†There are many other examples to choose from across our shared history of storytelling and encoding hidden meaning. The word 'Church' is an English one coming from the Scottish word, 'Kirk' or 'Kirke' in Scandinavia, which in turn goes back to 'Cerse' in ancient Roman language (a Goddess), itself derived from 'Circe' in ancient Greek mythology. Circe, a goddess and daughter of Helios (also known as Ra or the Sun God in ancient Egyptian mythology), was able to hypnotize humans with wands, potions and herbs, bring them into her home and turn them into animals if offended by them (sometimes eat them for sustenance).¬†Likewise, the Moses tale was originally that of an Egyptian hero, Ra-Harakhti, the reborn sun god of Canopus, whose life story was copied by biblical scholars into the 10 commandments, plagiarized from the Egyptian story of negative confessions out of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Tibet has one of those too. The acts performed by Moses with the flowering rod, river of blood, and tablets of the law were also symbols derived (plagiarized) from Greek mythology. For instance, the miracle of drawing water from a rock was first performed by Mother Rhea (sister and wife of Cronus) after she gave birth to Zeus, and by Atalanta with the help of Artemis. The miracle of drying up the waters to travel dry-shod was earlier performed by Isis, or Hathor, on her way to Byblos. Different versions can be found originating out of India.¬†Jesus (whichever version you prefer) is also a symbolic metaphor for spiritual and intellectual enlightenment, not an actual person as it is commonly portrayed today. Dr Richard Carrier, one of the few who has conducted academic research into the historicity of the Jesus character is a good place to look. The triangle or holy trinity of father, son and holy ghost similarly echoes throughout belief systems over time. The fable of turning water into wine is an exercise in science from the Egyptians who understood that it was sun, plus water (rain) and time that gave life to the vines producing grapes, giving rise to wine (yes the Egyptian's had the earliest wines). You are unwittingly learning about the processes of photosynthesis and transpiration over time responsible for plant growth.¬†The word Israel is another representation of past themes. Isis was the Egyptian moon goddess (In Egyptian mythology, Isis was an Egyptian mother goddess; wife-sister of Osiris, sister of Nephthys, mother of Horus, noted for having played a key role in the resurrection of the dead Osiris (sound familiar), after his hacking into 14 pieces by the god Set, as told in the famous story \"Passion of Osiris\" (later re-branded to the Passion of Christ). Ra was the sun god of Egypt. Saturn was the god of the Elohim. Isis (Is), Ra, and Elohim (El) = IsRaEl.¬† This is also where words like elected, elevated and elite derive from.¬†Horus was thought of as the \"height of the heavens\" and ranked as the oldest god of Egypt, who became re-conceptualized in the Dynastic era, via the Heliopolis recension (circa 2,500BC), as the son of Osiris (Sirius/Dog Star) and Isis (Ra/Sun). Horus leads to the word horizon. When Jesus, son of God walked on water, this is actually symbolic of light dancing across water (likely the Nile) as the sun sets - maybe they also saw green flashes as the sun dipped out of sight and became aware of the significance of 42 degrees, at they seemed to have a real thing for embedding the mathematics of complex astronomy within the physical dimensions of the ancient Egyptian stone structures (Ghiza pyramid for example:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7oyZGW99os&list=LL&index=28&t=32s) Here is a good explanation of the importance of 42 degrees and how a sphere (the sun?) can act as a prism and break up light according to its various wavelengths¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEGRjSGrPnU¬†.¬†The importance of the Sun is reflected in common usage symbology - Christian and Judeo crosses typically have a circle around the intersection. This represents the sun and the 4x points on the zodiac (N, E, S & W). This is why there are 4x Gospels, 1 for each season (Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter), however there is only 1x original Gospel, that of Luke from which all other stories/gospels were spun. Luke comes from Luca. Luca derives from \"lux\" which means \"light\" in Latin. Luca (and Luke) means \"light\", having the same root as Lucy, Lucius in Roman times. In fact, in the ancient times, Luca was the name given to babies born at dawn, since dawn is the first light (lux) of the day.¬†The Age of Aquarius is an astrological age (a month), which occurs because of a real motion of Earth known as the precession of the equinoxes that causes the identity of the Pole Star to change over time. The cycle of precession, 1 great year lasts 25,920 years, and there are 12 constellations of the Zodiac (astrological months). So, roughly every 2,160 years, the sun‚Äôs position at the time of the March, or vernal, equinox moves in front of a new zodiac constellation. The Age of Aquarius (New Testament, Luke 22:10) begins when the March equinox point moves out of the constellation Pisces and into the constellation Aquarius. This transition was marked at the end of 2020 by a rare conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, not seen for some 800 years. In John 1: 29 John the Baptist which equates to the constellation Aquarius (a man bearing a pitcher of water) refers to the lamb of God, referring to the Aries constellation. Matthew 3: 11-12 referring to a widowing fan for wheat depicted as being held in the hand of the Orion constellation. This recording of celestial 'scenes' in mythological texts goes back over 5,000 years, where instead of Jesus it was Krishna playing a central role. These are just some of the many dozens of examples where stories and characters are direct references to celestial scenes. David Mathisen who has written and lectured widely on the topic is also worth a look.

{"cid": "UgzNcNwCSBJgfUkJyrx4AaABAg.9KOUXm9ZX4x9Kjt8JiXRia", "text": "Saturnists for instance, believe that it is the planet Saturn that is the most powerful deity or God (father of the Sun), which drives the universe. In ancient Rome, Saturn was a God conflated with the Titan, Cronus from prior Greek mythology. Cronus (the father of time), who ruled the Golden Age and took his sister Rheas his incestuous partner. Gaea and Uranus however had prophesied he would be dethroned by one of his offspring. As such, their first 5x offspring together were eaten by Cronus until Rhea managed to switch out the 6th (Zeus) with a stone so he escaped this fate. Modern Christmas festivities derive from the highly popular Roman festival of Saturnalia, a carnival where social norms were reversed and slaves were free for the day and would be served on by their masters.¬†An occultation in Astronomy happens when something becomes hidden behind something else. The last occultation of Saturn was April 25th 2019 when it passed behind or was masked by the moon. Astro-Theology and its meanings are hidden behind and under the surface of modern monotheistic religions, hence the association with the 'occult' and use of masks;- ¬†Kubrick's, Eyes Wide Shut is an interesting reference point in popular culture. ¬†¬†Saturn is considered the King of the Planets within our solar system and like the Dog Star, is one of the brightest objects in the night sky visible to the naked eye. It is also one of the largest and would contain some 750 Earths within it, yet it would float on water due to its low density. It has a large number of satellites, some 53 named (typically after Titans in ancient Greek mythology), Janus, Rhea, Titan (the largest of its moons), Pandora & Prometheus (shepherd moons steadying its rings, which add to its reflectivity and thus brightness in the night sky), Pan are some of the more commonly known examples.¬†One moon, Mimas, was the inspiration for the Death Star in Star Wars. The likeness is unmistakable. The name Luke Skywalker means Sun travelling across the sky in 12 steps (hours). The 'Force' for instance is representative of the influence of Saturn over space and time. Pandora, one of Saturn's many moons, is often referred to with some deeper meaning because it is associated with a box, i.e. a black cube. But this is a misnomer, it was a vase or jar not a box which was left with only hope inside after Pandora (the first woman created by the Gods out of clay in Greek mythology) had opened it.¬†So why is it that the brightest star in the night sky and likely inspiration for the original concept of deity was named the ‚ÄòDog Star‚Äô?¬†Well, it could be reconciled as looking like a simple stick dog when joining the dots and humans do tend to project or look for images of things already in existence in the natural world (animals in the sky), particularly animals of significant meaning or value. The constellation was initially viewed by Mesopotamians and Babylonians as an arrow and bow aiming at Orion. The Ancient Greeks later changed this to a dog. The Canis Major representing the dog Laelap, a gift from Zeus to Europa, or one of Orion's hunting dogs. In medieval Arab astronomy it became 'the greater dog'. Hunting with the bow and domesticated dogs is perhaps one of the longest standing human activities associated with feeding oneself and the tribe or community and is still relevant being practiced in many parts of the world today. Similarly, Graham clearly shows that when dating ancient sites, for instance Giza by its astrological alignment with the Leo and Orion constellations and the river Nile lining up with the Milkyway (thought to then have been the pathway to the afterlife or Duat) and calculating for precession, it dates back in excess of 12,000 years.\nSo what could have been so important for ancient civilizations around the globe to have undertaken such painstaking science and mathematics and then encode such data into multiple modalities of recorded information (symbology, gematria, language, architecture etc.)? Encodings so ubiquitous as to have made it through time into the mythological texts of today's modern, mono-theistic religions the world over.¬†Astrophysicists recently unearthed deep cycles wherein periodic comet showers occur in the Solar System every 26 to 30 million years, producing cyclical impacts and resulting in periodic mass extinctions. Our solar system cycles through the crowded mid-plane of the Milky Way Galaxy about every 30 million years. During those times, comet showers are possible, leading to large impacts on the Earth. The impacts can create conditions that would stress and potentially kill off land and marine life, including widespread dark and cold, wildfires, acid rain, and ozone depletion. \"These new findings of coinciding, sudden mass extinctions on land and in the oceans, and of the common 26- to 27-million-year cycle, lend credence to the idea of periodic global catastrophic events as the triggers for the extinctions,‚Äù said the lead author Rampino. ‚ÄúIn fact, three of the mass annihilations of species on land and in the sea are already known to have occurred at the same times as the three largest impacts of the last 250 million years, each capable of causing a global disaster and resulting mass extinctions.‚Äù We are now in what is now commonly understood to be the 6th mass extinction, although not one resulting from a cosmic event, but through our own self undoing.¬†As for our relatively short 200,000 ‚Äì 300,000 year biological near history, this has not been easy either. For instance, the Younger Dryas cosmic event over 12,000 years ago wasn't likely the first time mega fauna (including early homo sapiens) were nearly wiped out from fireballs raining down from the sky. Around 70,000 years ago, a super volcano named Toba erupted, blowing roughly 670 cubic miles (2,800 cubic kilometers) of vaporized rock and debris into the air. This is thought to have caused a massive struggle for humanity, ultimately leading to a population bottleneck that whittled down our numbers to as few as 1,000 reproductive adults. Notably, this coincided with a nomadic star (Scholz's star) that came within a light-year of the Sun, likely sending dozens of comets and asteroids tumbling out of the solar system from behind the Gemini constellation towards Earth.¬†More recently, the end of the last ice age was an extremely difficult epoch for all megafauna struggling to eke out a life in system Earth. A world whose sky had shattered the ground, blasting through ice and rock with comet impacts changing and mostly wiping out the future of much of life on then Earth and bringing about a subsequent cooling event (Younger Dryas cold episode circa 12,900 to 11,700 years ago) that caused much of the life that had survived the initial events to subsequently fade away. This likely resulted from our planet's close relationship with the Taurid‚Äôs debris belt, which is believed to be the remnants of a much larger comet that disintegrated some 20,000 to 30,000 years ago and has a cycle of activity with a 2,500 - 3000 year frequency. Named Taurids on account of the Taurus constellation from which this activity emanates. Most of the time we pass through this debris belt unscathed, thanks mostly to the dense gravitational pulls of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, but we regularly run the gauntlet as we continue to pass through the tail end.¬†The Younger Dryas cosmic event has been corroborated from multiple disciplines of research now across peer reviewed scientific journals. This was an extremely difficult epoch for all megafauna struggling to eke out a life in system Earth. A world whose sky had shattered the ground, blasting through ice and rock, causing huge floods and precipitation events with comet impacts changing and mostly wiping out the future of much of life on then Earth and bringing about a subsequent cooling event (Younger Dryas cold episode circa 12,900 to 11,700 years ago) that caused much of the life that had survived the initial events to subsequently fade away.

CO2 is unaffected by nonresonant frequencies, and if CO2 is already excited, even radiation at the correct frequency will be rejected (scattered) by CO2 (thus a heated CO2 molecule will not absorb another photon) and the energy transfer from a photon to increase a temperature requires that the wavelength to be shorter than the wavelength frequency absorbing it.\n\n However, it can absorb KE in this process from collision/bumping molecules even several times before emitting its absorbed energy {which would increase the emitted energy}.\n\nIn other words it requires more kinetic energy than what CO2 can absorb by a 15 micron photon.

You say that people who have training in the topic say that GHGs increase atmospheric temperature by creating energy out of nothing.

Do you both, with your combined understanding, not even understand how GHGs work?\n\nGHGs don't increase the actual temperature of the earth beyond the energy that is already in the earth's system because that isn't how GHGs work. That isn't how any of this works, and it isn't what anybody thinks happens. \n\nGHGs restrict the rate at which energy is lost to space. I have said this over and over and over, yet the both you combined can't understand this literally elementary school level topic despite trying to say you are physics trained.

I haven't provided many links because of not wanting to take the chance at being blocked.\n\nThe lower atmosphere would be about 0 Fahrenheit on average without GHGs in the atmosphere. This is in contrast to the roughly 15 or so degrees Celsius we currently see. \n\nGHGs are interesting in the way to interact with radiation. Solar radiation is SWR, or short wave radiation. It is a very high frequency, and GHGs don't interact with this radiation. As a body cools from being warmed it emits a longer wavelength radiation back, and we call the radiation the earth sends back to space LWR (long wave radiation). GHGs can interact with LWR, and it absorbs some of this energy and then releases it back into the atmosphere. Some of this goes to space as it would without GHGs present, but some is directed back to earth. This keeps some of that energy from escaping to space and slows the rate of emissions. We have tracked it, actually, by observing the LWR budget in specific electromagnetic bands going to space and going down to earth.\n\nWithout GHGs, this LWR would essentially have nothing stopping it from escaping to space, and the earth would cool much faster and cool to a lower temperature at night. It would also not warm as much during the day. It wouldn't lose all heat at night due to the rate of loss and the time before the sun comes back up.\n\nThe temperature of ~0 Fahrenheit is what the average would be across the globe without GHGs present, and thus with LWR being able to escape more freely. The earth would still maintain an average above absolute zero because of the warmth during the day and the fact that a radiative body can only radiate so much energy per unit time. This average for the earth has been estimated to be about 0 Fahrenheit.\n\nGHGs increase this by slowing the rate of heat loss, especially at night. This causes the average temperature to be higher throughout the day. It also heats the poles faster than lower latitudes, which causes the average globally to go up more.\n\nI see where you are coming from with the temperature not going beyond what it was, but the actual temperature of the earth during daytime is higher than 15 Celsius. Since GHGs slow the emission back to space the average only drops to about 15 instead of dropping to 0 Fahrenheit. The actual temperature the globe gets to during the day is more than 15 Celsius so GHGs aren't increasing the actual temperature, merely slowing how fast it decreases. The total energy from the sun is more than the energy retained through GHG interactions.\n\nI hope that makes sense.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Erik Davis", "channel": "UCpixFCgyYTRMTsC1daacuvg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRA5nahHlBQgMFsD3-OJxkL1JUOBu8dZoezDw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Those all bolster the impact, and water vapor concentration and feedback loops are directly influenced by increasing CO2 emissions.\n\nYou are also misunderstanding how CO2 increases temperature. It isn't through kinetic energy transfer. I realize you are simply rehashing what the previous two people have tried to say, but it is still a misunderstanding. CO2 increases temperature via reducing LWR emissions to space, not by transferring kinetic energy to surrounding molecules. \n\nAs to your analogy, what is the average temperature after you add CO2? You go from an average of ~30 to an average of ~32.5 degrees. You can also get a slightly higher max temperature due to this excess energy that doesn't get released overnight. The earth does not heat up to the maximum temperature it possibly can from solar radiation each day since it also emits radiation back.

And heat only ever goes one way....from hot to cold. So you could have any amount of ‚Äòresidual‚Äô thermal energy but it won‚Äôt add heat to a higher thermal energy. \nI think this is also why you keep talking about averages. Yes Climate is the long term average of weather, but the weather is not driven by the climate average but by real time effects of actual phenomena. The sun is hot enough to suck thousands of tons of water thousands of feet into the air creating clouds, rain, Hadley cells, trade winds etc etc. nothing to do with CO2.

You are confusing colloquial terms for the scientific terms. That is why I keep trying to use temperature and energy when I can so you and others won't get stuck in semantics instead of looking at the actual argument. \n\nAs I stated before, the total energy received by earth is more than the actual temperature outside would reflect due to the earth continually releasing radiation to space(and being used in other forms). Thus, CO2 can cause the temperature to slowly increase toward that maximum temperature by elevating the average LWR and energy available in the atmosphere instead of letting it escape as rapidly so space.\n\nAgain, the energy from the sun is where most all energy for the planet comes from; nobody argues that. However, the solar energy has been decreasing over the years while we continue to increase in global average temperature. This is due to increased GHG emissions for the most part. Remember, while the sun does provide energy to the planet, it is heating the earth from the CMB + internal sources to about 255 degrees Kelvin, with GHG's making up much of the rest above that.\n\nYou seem to be misunderstanding how CO2 increases atmospheric temperature. CO2 radiates energy in, roughly, a sphere. Part of the energy goes to space, while the rest gets redirected to earth. If you lower the rate of energy loss of a system, the average energy available to that system per unit time will increase. \n\nAnd again, CO2 isn't making the entire system hotter than it would be from solar and internal sources. It simply allows the system to rest at a higher equilibrium state that is still lower than the total energy received from the sun and internal sources. It isn't adding extra energy to the sun, but you don't have to to see an increase in average temperature. Now, if the earth absorbed all radiation from the sun in all forms and didn't emit radiation back, GHGs wouldn't heat the earth since that would adding energy to the system. The earth doesn't behave that way, though.\n\nConvection does play a role, but it doesn't negate the effect of GHGs.\n\nWe don't combine dodgy temperature readings and physics. Actually study up on how the data was used, look across departments and fields across the entire globe and across the innumerable scientific fields that confirm AGW.

It is equal to 1.60217646 √ó 10^-13 joules.  \n\r\nAn ice cube emits mainly at a wavelength of 10.7 microns. So the energy of ice photons are about 50% ‚Äúhotter‚Äù than photons emitted/reflected by CO2.  \n\r\n#3 If a photon is reflected then there is no energy exchange, reflection happens as often as absorption, otherwise our eyes would be of little use. Unless you are looking into a source, such as a fire or the sun, you are able to see because of reflected photons.   \n\r\nFor vibration and/or rotational modes, there must exist a magnetic dipole for photon absorption to occur. The molecule is unaffected by nonresonant frequencies, and if the molecule is already excited, even radiation at the correct frequency will be rejected (scattered) by the molecule (thus a heated CO2 molecule will not absorb another photon) and the energy transfer from a photon to increase a temperature requires that the wavelength to be shorter than the wavelength frequency absorbing it. In simple thermodynamics it is the same concept as hot to cold only on a micro scale. \n\nCO2 does not have a magnetic dipole in a relaxed state, which means it must become IR active by way of collision/conduction or heated in some other manner.  Atmospheric molecules are either Raman active or IR active as a general rule of thumb, not both at the same time.\n\r\n#4 Absorption is affected by temperature. If you want a surface to be a good absorber, cool it off. If you could cool to Absolute Zero, the surface would be a perfect ‚Äúblack body‚Äù, able to absorb all photons. If you heated a surface to a very high temperature it would be a very poor absorber. At room temperatures, infrared wavelengths are typically not absorbed.   \n\r\n#5 You often hear ‚ÄúIf a system has more energy coming in than going out, its temperature MUST increase‚Äù. They apply that nonsense to Earth‚Äôs surface (the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù) by misinterpreting entropy. Adding more CO2 to the atmosphere means more infrared energy coming back to Earth. So, in their version of science, they believe that means surface temperatures must raise.  \n\r\nAgain this energy is already in the system, not new energy being put in the system. Photons being reflected are being emitted from a radiation source on the surface and some of those photons are returning by way of re-radiating or reflecting at the speed of light back to the surface from a line spectrum, Delta E =hf ( Change in energy equals Plank‚Äôs Constant 6.626x10^34 J s and the frequency of emitting and absorbing EM radiation.) \n\r\nOf course infrared impacting the surface does NOT imply absorption. (See #1.) You CAN add energy to a system without increasing temperatures. \n\nBring a bowl of ice cream into your den. The ice cream is emitting infrared. You have ‚Äúadded energy‚Äù to the system (den), but do you expect the room temperature to increase? Or, add a liter of water at 40 degrees to a large bowl already containing water at 45 degrees. You have added energy to the large bowl (system), but the average temperature DROPS. Thermodynamic ‚Äúheat‚Äù has two components: 1) energy transfer, and 2) from ‚Äúhot‚Äù to ‚Äúcold‚Äù (ŒîT). Without both components, there is no ‚Äúheat‚Äù just a transfer of energy. No heat=no raise in temperature.  \n\r\nSo that is what happens to the energy. Anyone claiming otherwise is misrepresenting the physics.  \n\nALL climate science (influenced by politics) is doing the same thing from the same starting point that everyone else supporting CO2 Climate Change does: they believe that the flux from the atmosphere must be warming the surface because they believe that the Sun cannot possibly be the sole source of heat ALONE .\n\nThey remotely measure a temperature, and then believe that this temperature ADDS with other temperatures to give a final higher temperature. What‚Äôs the temperature of a radiative 200 W/m^2 emission??? Its 243K or -30 C remotely measuring a temperature does not mean that temperature adds or is adding to your warmer temperature. \n\nBy mismanaging the actual Sun‚Äôs potential power they can add the Greenhouse Theory as a supplement to justify the surface temperature already provided by the Sun and by misinterpreting entropy (by assuming energy is always heat) they think they have proven it. \n\nThey have proven no such thing.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "CD Marshall", "channel": "UCkSBIG_49rCl7M78fIYa_Gw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRH-YsB7xP96BAZApFI6da4ctmWeF41Magdp8Fu7A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In physics it‚Äôs called the Maxwell gravito-thermal theory it has also been coined the Maxwell gravito-thermal greenhouse effect theory. Richard Feynman mentioned the mechanics of the process a few times. \r\n‚Ä¶\r\n6 basic processes determine a change in troposphere air temperature and of those processes only one does it without the addition of energy. Not one of these processes is the ghge or even supports the theory of the ghge. \n\n\r\n>5 are a diabatic process, \"A thermodynamic change of state of a system in which the system exchanges energy with its surroundings by virtue of a temperature difference between them\".\n\n\r\n 1.

Advection:\r\n >Horizontal movement of air. \n\n\r\n4. Radiation:\r\n >Exchanging thermal energy to space. Radiation is thermal energy transferred away from Earth by the emissions of electromagnetic waves to space and the only means of emissions of energy off the planet. \n\n\r\n>80% of the EM radiation escapes to space through the open atmospheric window between 8-13 micron. \n\n\r\n*>The 20% that is intercepted by greenhouse gases has created an entire branch of incorrect climate science.* \n\n\r\n5. Latent Heat: \r\n>The water phase which transfers en masse thermal energy from the surface to the atmosphere and powers our climate via the Hadley cells. \n\n\r\n6. Adiabatic Process: \"A process in which there is no exchange of heat or mass with the environment. In an adiabatic process, a change in internal energy is solely a consequence of work. For an ideal gas and most atmospheric conditions, compression results in warming, whereas expansion results in cooling.\"\n\n\r\n >Without work from the outside only this process remains, air expands as it rises and compresses as that air descends. Thus the troposphere functions as a Carnot cycle (as atmospheric science teaches): \n\n\r\n>Reversible isothermal expansion \r\n>Reversible adiabatic expansion \r\n>Reversible isothermal compression \r\n>Reversible adiabatic compression \n\n\r\nNow the lapse rate, \"The decrease of an atmospheric variable with height, the variable being temperature, unless otherwise specified.\" Is reversible, meaning: \"Thus the same parcel of air at the surface is warmer than it is as it rises in the atmosphere, just as the potential energy of that parcel of air declines as it moves back towards the earth's surface. The lapse rate cools the hotter air as it rises and warms it as it lowers.\" \n\n\r\nKinetic energy/potential energy. \r\nAll energy loss from a heated material is cooling.\n\n\r\nThe three cooling mechanisms are:\r\n1. Conduction (which in the case of conduction to air in a gravity field leads to convection, the adiabatic process which is flux asymmetric, it acts like a one-way gate).\n\n\r\n2. Evaporation ‚Äì all evaporation is cooling. (Remember that Latent Heat is a hidden store of energy, it has no kinetic signature).\n\n\r\n3. Thermal Radiation (the diabatic process which is a gradient flux cascade of half out and half back).\n\n\r\nAnd for good measure there is also the issue of thermal inertia; the heat capacity of the body being warmed. The thermal capacity (specific heat) of water is much larger than that of air. Water takes longer to warm and stores more energy.\n\n\r\n‚ÄúIt is impossible to radiate potential energy, so when held at elevation in a convection cell the former kinetic energy of the rising air mass is now locked into the air parcel by virtue of its position.

If you remove the variable that is changing, of course you won't see change. Nobody said the average not factoring in GHGs has changed. Again, try to not straw man for just 1 sentence.\n\nGlobal data has changed remarkably since 1980. Even AGW deniers have stopped using that long-debunked trope for the most part. What you are referencing is from a blog that employs literally zero scientists or even people with an education in the topic. I would suggest using peer review and not blogs with no education. Wattsup and Tony Heller are sources that haven't told a single true thing since they were thought up. Granted, what should I expect from a person who said we should listen to a guy who purposely used contaminated data to say the 1800's saw 500+ ppm globally and then tried to say it was a conspiracy against the guy when I pointed out he knowingly used contaminated data.\n\nYou also seem to be trying to conflate US temperature for a single day for global average temperatures. You do realize that AGW can cause the average temperature to increase while we still have individual daily heat records that haven't been broken, right? Are you so illiterate of even basic math that you don't understand that? Also, a single place on earth is not the globe.\n\nYes, some people have set CO2's forcing very low, but the sum total evidence of nearly every other person indicates that it is much higher than that. You are cherry picking extreme outliers to try to say everything else is wrong.\n\nI already admitted that the total solar radiation imparted to the earth is more than 15 C, but that doesn't mean the earth will heat to that with solar forcing alone.

Feynman, while brilliant, was not a climate scientist and is missing some 34 years of scientific acumen and discovery at a minimum. The big paper you reference with gravity was retracted due to some duplicitous actions by the authors, but it was also a single paper that has not been verified or repeated. It has, however, been repeated in text (not in verification or peer review) over and over again on denier blogs that have no trained person on staff.\n\nNear everything you have said is almost verbatim what can be found of denier blogs, none of which have any training in the topic or even science in general.

It would also explain why you keep straw manning everything I and other scientists say: your script won't let deviate when a person keeps trying to correct your straw men.\n\nI'll again state that you are like a person saying experts are wrong when they say \"1+1=4\" because \"1+1 obviously equals 3\" when the experts keep trying to tell you \"1+1=2.\" You straw man the other side and even get your own conclusions incorrect because you don't understand the topic well enough. \"2 years\" of study on denier blogs literally makes you less knowledgeable of the topic than a person with no knowledge of the topic since all you \"know\" is wrong.\n\nAnd again, I have no reason to defend or provide any evidence at all for your straw man versions of my view since it isn't what my view is.

At least CD Marshall is explaining the physics in a manner that can be understood and referenced.\nIf all you can do is parrot AGW talking points and refer to anything that deviates from that as a straw man then I was mistaken in thinking you had a legitimate argument to make.\nAll I know is that heat cannot be produced from an object of lesser thermal temperature going to a higher thermal temperature. i.e. a lower frequency cannot add to a higher frequency and make it higher still.\nTherefore if the sun produces an average temperature of say 15C at the surface, no amount of back radiation or side radiation or so called trapping radiation is going to produce a greater temperature than 15C...period. In other words a lower temperature, or thermal temperature, or frequency has nothing to add to a higher temperature or frequency. As in my analogy of the boiling water @40C...you can‚Äôt add 20C warm water and get more than the 40C that you started with! The sun produces whatever the sun produces during the day regardless of any so called trapping. \nIf (and its a big if considering the last 5 years of colder winters around the world) the temperature is the hottest it has ever been, it has extremely little to do with CO2.

He is either lying or doesn't actually understand the topic well enough despite me continually correcting him. He also continues to straw man me over and over and over. I can barely fit in enough in my replies to correct his straw men, much less go into detail on why he is wrong.\n\nThe heat trapping ability of GHGs is not in question. It is demonstrable. It is provable. It has been done thousands and thousands of times. Marshal simply keeps misunderstanding thermodynamics and atmospheric physics.\n\nI'm not parroting anything. I am literally correcting his straw men. I don't call anything that deviates a straw man. I call his straw men \"straw men.\" It isn't my fault he keeps lying about my position. If he would stop lying about my position I would stop calling him out for it. \n\nI have made my argument multiple times in this near the beginning. The problem is that he keeps lying about what my argument was. That is why I have repeatedly asked him to state my position. He can't because all he can do is lie about it.\n\nYou misunderstand thermodynamics. I have explained this multiple times already. Nobody, and I mean no person with any knowledge of the topic, says that a body of lower thermal energy is heating a body of higher thermal energy. I never said that. AGW doesn't say that. No expert has said that. Marshal simply lies and says we hold that position even after I state unequivocally that we do not say that.\n\nGHGs increase atmospheric temperature, again, by slowing the rate of radiation loss. It is as simple as that. I have stated this over and over.\n\nThe sun doesn't create 15 C on earth. Solar forcing alone, with no GHGs in the atmosphere, would see an average of around -18 C. This is because, while the total energy from the sun would cause a higher temperature on earth during the day, much is lost at night. The average thus settles around -18 C. however, with GHGs in the atmosphere, the rate that the earth loses radiation to space slows. It thus loses less radiation per unit time. Thus the average temperature is higher than without GHGs. I quite literally can't make this more simple to understand. If you can't understand this, please study the topic because this is the most basic of basic aspects. I don't mean to insult you if you can't grasp it. It just means you are ignorant of the topic, and ignorance is not a bad thing. it simply means you can learn more than you know. Science is built on ignorance.\n\nI'll try to explain with the analogy again. You have a pot of water and provide a set amount of energy to the pot. The energy after a set time increases the water to temperature \"x.\" You then turn the flow of energy off and allow the water to cool. You then take the average temperature over the entire time frame. You repeat this over and over and over and find the average temperature we'll call \"y.\" Now, the energy being emitted by the radiation source is higher than the \"x\" value, but the water is not absorbing radiation long enough to reach that value. This potential value we'll call \"z.\" So our current variables are:\nx1-temperature water gets to\ny1-average temperature\nz-total potential temperature (always greater than x)\n\nNow, if you add a barrier that slows the rate of energy loss from the water such as a glass dome, the rate of energy loss will slow. Thus the average value for the temperature will be greater than Y1. This can allow the new X2 value to be higher than X1. However, X2 will still be lower than Z. No extra energy has been added, and no energy has gone from a colder body to a warmer one. No laws of thermodynamics have been broken, but the temperature of the water will increase.\n\nYou can literally test this by conducting the experiment. Simply give a set time to warm and cool and a set amount of energy (turning burner or other source of energy to the same temperature each time that is higher than the water gets, preferably keeping the water below boiling so as to not cause a decrease in mass, kinetic energy transfer, sound, and the like). For example provide a source of energy that could potentially increase the temperature to, say, 150 but only supply the energy source for an amount of time that keeps the water from reaching 150 degrees.

But the weather is not a result of averages, it‚Äôs real time actual effects of actual phenomena. Climate is then the average of the weather.\nStarting with -18C and then having to add GHGs to get +15C is just bullsht. \nSo if you are continuing to assert that CO2 ‚Äòtraps‚Äô heat in the atmosphere I need to know how? A ground station temperature device measures the temperature of the entire air parcel not just CO2 molecules. So if increasing the CO2 level by 100ppm has increased the its concentration by .01% and has increased the temp by 1C how has that temp been transferred to the other air molecules? It could only be by kinetic collision which as I said before that would mean the CO2 would have to be at astronomical temperatures to achieve it.\nEven if you double the amount of CO2 the other 1249 air molecules are convecting heat away which to me leaves CO2 having little to do with anything apart from plant food.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Plom De Nume", "channel": "UCEWyRdRt4YcmcifZLG--9Hg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQvBSLbZjIRlpgnH1_8wzu32IDbkImjXS0sDsN_=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If less energy is lost per day, more energy remains in the system when the sun comes back around to add more energy.

CO2 concentrations have increased \"only\" 120-140 ppm, but that equates to an almost 50% increase in concentration. Yes, the amount relative to the entire atmosphere is small, but the actual change in amount is very large.\n\nCO2's kinetic energy transfer is seen in the upper atmosphere, where it can cause a reduction in energy, but the lower atmosphere is dominated by GHG \"trapping\" abilities.\n\nMuch of the physics and thermodynamics Marshall brings up is actually correct with regard to the math (some isn't, but that is a different topic), but he is attributing it to the topic in the wrong way by claiming the side of science says things we don't.

I've even had a self proclaimed physics grad argue with me than an ice cube is producing heat to its environment at ambient temperatures. Energy moves both ways in a system, heat is just the net difference (more of that physics I actually do understand). For example ice cubes emit mainly at a wavelength of 10.7 microns and a flux of 300 W/m^2.  Energy can increase but not the flux. A hundred ice cubes emit at 300 W/m^2 or a million.

That said, do you not understand how slowing the rate of energy loss causes more energy to stay in the system and create a new, higher equilibrium state? \n\nAlso, the average surface temperature is not 15C without GHGs unless GHGs do not function as all physics dictates and all direct, observed, and repeated experiments show.

First, it assumes that the science doesn't take into account adiabatic and convective forces despite the fact that we do. Second, it assumes only feedback loops that help their conclusion and ignore the ones that don't (e.g., only assume clouds will have a cooling effect since they need the temperature to drop at a certain point despite clouds having both a cooling and warming effect that changes by type, height, and time of day). It even admits to the greenhouse effect being real, just not as potent as other work suggests. it also makes assumptions when it literally says \"we assume\" the extra heating in the atmosphere between the radiative and surface temperature is caused entirely by heat capacity. It doesn't prove it. It literally says to assume it. It also states that man's influence is small compared to nature so it should just be ignored and not factored in. In other words, it starts under the assumption man's influence shouldn't be factored in and then assumes values required for that specific conclusion, and then states that the conclusion is that man's influence shouldn't be taken into account. In doing so, however, it even admits that GHGs do function as we believe and that man is causing a change, just not large enough for them to merit factoring it in despite the fact that we already know that man's influence is small compared to nature.

The pull/squeeze on Earth's mass cause fluctuations within the core, and the Climate Change Cult does not like attributing anything to our Sun in terms of being a catalyst. \n\nSo... officially, they admit there's no link but they still try to make claims or speculate. But the place where the Climate Cult fails imo is that they believe Carbon Taxes and Carbon Offsets will be their savior. Not recognizing that plants thrive in high-CO2 concentrations, meaning plant-life increases in those conditions.

Even the Catholic Church, at that time, believed the earth was flat and the center of the universe. When Gallileo observed that the other planets were spherical, he concluded that the earth must also be spherical. He went on to prove that the sun did not orbit the earth, but the earth orbited the sun. He was deemed to be a heretic and was thereby excommunicated from the 'closed minded thinking' of the Catholic Church. Inspired by the findings of Gallileo, Columbus sailed, not believing the flat earthers. \nHow strange it is that only in the past few years, did the Catholic Church finally conceded and acknowledged the findings of Gallileo and reinstated him back to the Church, even though they have known the facts hundreds of years ago.

First, when ships sailed away from land, they disappeared below the horizon. Secondly, they observed that the earth cast a circular shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse. Furthermore, Eratosthenes, who lived in Greece in the third century BC estimated the circumference of the Earth within 2% of the actual number. He used shadows and angles to come up with his result. He would have never made such a measurement if he thought the earth was flat.

But I do think they're accurate, except that I believe the people in control (the ones misleading the blind) know exactly what they're doing.

They get their power from deceit. Kinda like the concept behind \"lesser magick\".\n\nI feel like they know how they're deceiving the world... and they're trying to deceive us into destruction as punishment for challenging their power. Look at how they poison our food, water and minds.\n\nThere was a game I played once... called Mass Effect 2, where there was a story within and it made me think..  Where a man's father got lost and shiprecked... then 10 yrs later his son goes searching for him b/c they got word of a possible match for his wreck. The captains of the crew (one being the father you're searching for) ends up feeding his stranded crew, poisonous food and saving the good food for the captains. Then the captains fought each other and killed each other, until the father was the last captain left, and was ruling his crew who had gone mentally deficient b/c of the poisonous food. It made the males aggressive and dumb, and the females were more submissive. So the father basically made a harem and yeah... it just made me think of how the people in control of us, poison us (our bodies, our minds, etc) and rule over us... thinking of us as nothing but animals... or less. Idk. It's a crazy deep parallel to our world today... but just something that always stuck w/ me. \n\nI looked up a quick video cinematic scene if you'd like to get a better idea what Im talking about.

Implied in this definition is the very important fact that a body never contains heat, but that heat is identified as heat only as it crosses the boundary. Thus, heat is a transient phenomenon‚Ä¶‚Äù -Thermodynamics, G. J. V. Wylen, John Wiley & Sons, 1960\n\r\n‚ÄúHeat is defined as any spontaneous flow of energy from one object to another caused by a difference in temperature between the objects‚Ä¶ The mechanism may be different in each case, but in each of these processes the energy transferred is called ‚Äúheat .‚Äù -Chapter 1 ‚Äì Energy in Thermal Physics Daniel V. Schroeder: An Introduction to Thermal Physics\n\r\n‚Äú‚Ä¶Thus ‚Äòheat‚Äô may be termed as the energy interaction at the system boundary which occurs due to temperature difference only. Heat is observable in transit at the interface i.e. boundary, it cannot be contained in a system‚Äù ‚ÄìApplied Thermodynamics by Onkar Singh\n\r\nOur Troposphere functions as a Carnot cycle (Google it) as such it is not in thermal equilibrium and it will never be in thermal equilibrium  and claiming COE (conservation of energy) dictates the atmosphere must be in thermal equilibrium is an error in understanding the LOT (Laws of Thermodynamics), ‚Äòheat in does not equal heat out‚Äô. \n\nEnergy in equals energy out and if the appropriate allocations for that energy was provided in the consensus science energy budgets that balance of energy would be evident in a 24 hour period. \n\r\nEnergy in reaching the SURFACE: 910-980 W/m^2 (Greater solar density flux dictates a more concentrated volume of energy in but only on half the planet and half the time of the outgoing flux). Greater density flux means the energy coming in is hotter than the energy going out.\n\r\n Energy out: 227.5 W/m^2 ‚Äì 245 W/m^2 (Over the entire planet in 24 hours thus less density flux over an extended period of time.) \n\n>Anything emitting above 0 Kelvin emits energy that does not mean it‚Äôs increasing the temperature. Energy does not automatically mean a temperature change. Thermodynamic ‚Äúheat‚Äù has two components: 1) energy transfer, and 2) from ‚Äúhot‚Äù to ‚Äúcold‚Äù, Delta T.\n\nWithout both components, there is no ‚Äúheat‚Äù just a transfer of energy. No heat=no raise in temperature thus the equation, (Th^4 ‚Äì Tc^4) from hot to cold.\n\r\nThe greenhouse effect does not mean an increase in surface temperature for a radiative source (the surface) cannot increase its own temperature without work especially from spectral lines for the atmosphere is not a radiative source, ergo, a black body. \n\r\nI think that‚Äôs enough for now.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "CD Marshall", "channel": "UCkSBIG_49rCl7M78fIYa_Gw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRH-YsB7xP96BAZApFI6da4ctmWeF41Magdp8Fu7A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Anyone can study science and  last I checked 2+2=4 no matter who solves it.\"\n\nYou responded,\n\"Scientifically heat is a transfer of energy and temperature is a measurement of average thermal energy in a system.\" followed by snide remarks.\n\nI clarified.\n\"Temperature (simplest definition) is a measure of kinetic energy and cannot produce thermodynamic heat unless it can increase temperature. Just because something has a temperature, does not mean it can produce heat.\"\n\nIn thermodynamics, heat, temperature and energy have specific definitions and functions. In other words, energy absorbing into a mass does not equate a change in temperature unless the specific requirements are met.\n\nHeat is a transfer of energy yes if the proper requirements are met. Thermal energy has a temperature, but more technically kinetic energy is how we measure temperature. \n\nDo you deny this for some reason?\n\nIce cubes have a temperature.\nAn ice cube can produce heat on something colder than itself. \nAn ice cube cannot produce heat on something warmer than itself.\nSomething warmer than the ice cube can transfer heat to the ice cube.\nAn ice cube in a freezer under thermal equilibrium can transfer energy freely in the freezer and not change the temperature.\n\nThis is why the radiative heat transfer equation is (Th^4-Tc^4) hot to cold.

He brought up one or two topics he didn't need to if he were wanting to only address a single aspect of what you said, but the vast majority involved answering your statements or questions.\n\nWe don't simply look at small sections of time to say the climate is warming or cooling. We look at the long-term trend. The current trend indicates warming.\n\n\"Present\" for that data is normally 1950, but the source you provided didn't give at actual time for what \"present\" means. The graph is thus not very useful. That said, it does show that global temperatures were, based on historic trend, going to begin decreasing but instead became steady and began increasing as our CO2 emissions began to rise at the end of the graph. We actually know this is what happened because the natural forcings that cause increases in atmospheric temperature have been indicating a cooling, not warming climate. We are, however, adding enough CO2 to cause it to instead continue to warm. Little more can be garnered from it, sadly. The temperature can also be higher with lower CO2 concentrations if other natural forcings are strong enough. We have, indeed, had times in the past where natural forcings could have allowed for a warmer atmosphere with a lower CO2 ppm, but that doesn't have anything to do with CO2's current influence.\n\nThe GISP you are using doesn't say what you think it does. That data, for a fact, only goes through 1855. The data begins 95 years before present, and \"present\" for GISP2 core data is 1950.

WOW.\n\n Thermodynamic heat (technically appropriate description in thermodynamics) must meet a requirement, Delta T, an energy transfer from hot to cold and is considered a transient phenomenon; heat is never contained in a system. Thus, CO2 does not trap heat, a physics impossibility and a deliberate misdirection by climate consensus science. \r\n\r\nFundamental physics radiative heat transfer:\r Q=s*(Th^4-Tc^4)\n\r\nQ\n\r\n\"Heat may be defined as energy in transit from a high temperature object to a lower temperature object. An object does not possess \"heat\"; the appropriate term for the microscopic energy in an object is internal energy. The internal energy may be increased by transferring energy to the object from a higher temperature (hotter) object - this is properly called heating.\" -HyperPhysics\n\nEnergy moving through the atmospheric system is not heat. For that energy to become heat it must first meet the appropriate thermodynamic requirements, (Th^4-Tc^4). \n\nEnergy transfer from a15 micron photon is not enough energy to melt an ice cube  so how does CO2 reach a higher vibrational/rotational state? CO2 is unaffected by nonresonant frequencies, and if CO2 is already excited, even radiation at the correct frequency will be rejected (scattered) by CO2 (thus a heated CO2 molecule will not absorb another photon) and the energy transfer from a photon to increase a temperature requires that the wavelength to be shorter than the wavelength frequency absorbing it. However, it can absorb KE in this process from collisional/bumping molecules even several times before emitting its absorbed photonic energy {which would increase the emitted energy}.\n\nIn other words it requires more kinetic energy than what CO2 can absorb by a 15 micron photon. So where does that energy come from?\n\n\"The internal energy may be increased by transferring energy to the object from a higher temperature (hotter) object \" that would be heated molecules by conduction/convection/advection or anything that is absorbing Raman scattering or a higher spectrum of infrared radiation. Molecules with a higher heat capacity like N2 and O2 would carry more internal energy than CO2 (even methane has a slightly higher HC than CO2 as does H20).\n\n*Note CO2 in its symmetric mode is Raman active NOT IR active.*\n\nSo what happens when homonuclear diatomic molecules collide/bump with a molecule with a dipole moment with less kinetic energy? It transfers that energy to the other molecule. Since CO2 once vibrating emits IR it essentially cools homonuclear diatomic molecules faster (that can‚Äôt shed IR off via emissions) after CO2 absorbs some of the transferred energy from those molecules. None magnetic dipole molecules of course radiate EM once heated, and can cool off but that takes longer without being able to shed off that IR. Magnetic dipole molecules cool the atmosphere off faster by absorbing some of the energy from higher energy emitting molecules and ejecting that energy at the speed of light which non IR molecules cannot do.\n\nSo no, CO2 is not warming the atmosphere it helps to cool it off faster by stealing energy from hotter molecules and re-radiating that energy in all directions. That does not mean any energy directed at the ground will be re-absorbed, it may very well just reflect back out to space, or a cloud or scatter on another molecule. \n\n>A single photon can be absorbed by CO2 and emit in around 70 microseconds.\n\n>Heated CO2 at all ambient temperatures of the Earth emits in the open atmospheric window between 8 and 13 microns.\n\n>Any radiation returning to the surface will not increase the surface temperature, a radiative source cannot increase its own energy without work and this energy is already in the system.\n\nThis is probably the most honest information about science anyone has ever given you and I have no doubt you will reject it all. \n\nBegin your tirade of denial here...", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "CD Marshall", "channel": "UCkSBIG_49rCl7M78fIYa_Gw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRH-YsB7xP96BAZApFI6da4ctmWeF41Magdp8Fu7A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The thermal capacity (specific heat) of water is much larger than that of air. Water takes longer to warm and stores more energy.\n\n\r\n‚ÄúIt is impossible to radiate potential energy, so when held at elevation in a convection cell the former kinetic energy of the rising air mass is now locked into the air parcel by virtue of its position.

I said that I have more training in this particular topic than a person who has a PhD in a different topic because I actually have training in the topic. I happen to have a masters in a topic that is directly related to climate. Having a PhD in one subject doesn't mean the person is magically a genius in all topics. The ironic part is you try to say I say I know everything, but I am the person stating I know just my field while the other guy doesn't know everything despite saying he does since he doesn't have training in the field. You have the issue backwards. \n\nFor instance, who do you think would know more about cooking: the best chef of a city or the best mechanic of a state? The mechanic is higher in knowledge of his subject, but he has less understanding of the topic being discussed: cooking. \n\nI never said I decide what is or is not true. \n\nI showed the graph you provided had been altered by literally providing you the original graph. The graph had not been changed from the source data for temperature. The only difference in the data was the CO2 data had been changed. This meant that the authors of your graph took the original data that went through 1950 and faked the CO2 data at the end of the graph. I could give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they simply thought \"present\" was the year they were making the graph so they added separate CO2 data that went though their year, but that would still make the graph faked if they meant to fake it or not.\n\nI said you can't accurately compare global data to a point source because global data will reflect differently than any single point source on earth. Some places will be warmer, and some will be colder. The location for that graph, for instance, is at a high latitude. Higher latitudes have seen a higher increase in average temperature than the global average. Thus the current temperature at that source has seen a higher change per unit CO2 emissions, something your graph doesn't show since it mixed emissions data through the 2000s with temperature data that only went through the 1950s.\n\nThe graph you provided is similar to a different graph by Easterbrook that does a similar mistake. It's data ends through 1855 and tries to say that past temperature were warmer than today by not stating the fact that the data only goes through 1855 and not 2000. Yes, the graph's end point is even 20 years out of date despite being 145 years later than the actual data provides.\n\nSo, you can run because you can't defend your side if you want, but I've done nothing to insult you or warrant you running. I've simply explained the topic and provided you the source data for a graph you provided that did two things: your graph didn't cite where it got the data for the graph from, forcing me to actually track down the original data, and ended up using data from different years and saying they were the same year.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Erik Davis", "channel": "UCpixFCgyYTRMTsC1daacuvg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRA5nahHlBQgMFsD3-OJxkL1JUOBu8dZoezDw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This helps the other person feel safe to open up to you. Then, add facts about that topic about which everyone knows. And finally, show how the known facts debunk the original alarm.\n\nExample:\nCLAIM: Global Warming will result in a greater number of violent storms and storms of greater strength.\n\nAGREEMENT: Hurricanes passing over warmer ocean waters will pick up more energy and become more dangerous.\n\nFACT: The work of Dr. Ryan Maue shows the strength of tropical cyclones over the last 40+ years on a slight uptrend.\n\nFACT: Wind only blows because of temperature differences. Hot air rises (upward movement of smoke, steam and hot-air balloons), and cold air descends (cool air by your ankles when you open your refrigerator door, or walk into an airconditioned mall).\n\nFACT: The greatest source of heat on the planet is the direct sunlight in the tropics. The greatest source of cold is all of the ice in the polar regions.\n\nFACT: Melt the ice and the difference between poles and tropics will become far less, making strong winds less likely.\n\nFACT: The counts of strong US tornadoes (EF3 through EF5) of the last 60+ years has been on a strong downtrend. In fact, the counts of EF4 and EF5 in 2018 hit zero for the first time since the record was kept.\n\nFACT: Violent storm counts per century during the far colder Little Ice Age were up to 10 times what they were in the 20th century. This is according to the preliminary work of the late Dr. Hubert Lamb, founder and first director of the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University.\n\nCONCLUSION: The claim that warming will result in stronger storms only applies to tropical cyclones, and not tornadoes. But the counts are trending toward zero. And this should make sense, because if the temperatures were the same everywhere, there would be no energy for wind, and no direction for wind to blow.\n\nThe claims of the Warming Alarmists can easily be debunked with an understanding of the science basics, like that in the #1 Weather Bestseller, Climate Basics: Nothing to Fear.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Rod Martin, Jr.", "channel": "UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTBcLgEgFRec3cg93TXwvv14L2fOoJDMZDAF9Lz=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Hitler hugged kids and laughed with them, encouraging them to become perfect little Nazis. That still didn't have anything to do with Kristalnacht and the Reichstag fire pinned on a patsy. Even good individuals can do evil things. The institution of the Catholic Church has been evil for 1700 years. But sadly too many people are relatively clueless about what constitutes evil. Yet, I married a Catholic and we remain deeply in love. One of her brothers is a Catholic priest and we have delightful conversations quite often. He does good things, and he knows there are some bad things within the church, but he continues to work from within trying to make it better.\n\nTrying to suggest that an organization is not continually evil because it does some good things, ignores logic. The evil United Nations does plenty of sweet sounding things. Their founders, including the evil, Biggest Oil Rockefellers, donated huge sums of money to medical schools, and then recommended that those schools support petroleum-based medicine. That same Rockefeller family supported Progressives and donated huge sums of money to \"free love\" socialite, Margaret Sanger, founder of the organization which later became Planned Parenthood.\n\nChrist is the arbiter of what Christianity means, and most Christians today fall far short of HIS definition,... including me! I still have a huge ego -- the source of all evil. Only one of the so-called \"popes\" ever walked on water,... to my knowledge. And I suspect that if Peter saw today's church, he would be whipping the idolaters much as Christ did the moneychangers in the temple in his day. The same type of egoistic reasonableness which slipped into America to corrupt its checks and balances, also slipped into the Catholic Church about 325 AD.\n\nDid you know that for 150+ years, congressmen have been betraying their Oaths of Office most of the time? The 10th Amendment prohibition against a HUGE federal government was entirely ignored by Congress. Breaking the LAW became commonplace, because everyone was doing it. Why not? It's not like betraying an Oath of Office comes with any penalties. Like corrupt George \"Dubya\" Bush said, the Constitution is just a \"piece of paper.\" The federal government became so huge in 1883, that Congress, led by Globalist-Leftists, decided to protect their criminality with Civil Service Reforms to lock the Deep State Swamp into place. That's ego, for you. Reasonable, cunning and evil.\n\nIn 325 AD, politicians took over the church, if they had not already done so, years earlier. By then, miracles were a faded memory.

A partial list of known synergetic forces includes: the frigid low pressure in the altosphere, the massive compression of atmosphere and fuel in the engine, the intense heat in the combustion zone, 2300 degree C., the subsequent return of this heat and pressure back into a frigid near vacuum, and in an area of extreme solar radiation at that altitude. All of these forces are capable of synergy. Synergenic compounds are new, they are unpredictable, they are almost unknown as to their affects A contrail contains seven carcinogens that are known, but there are dozens more.  \nJust as serious are the affects of condensation on contrails. The exchange of hot exhaust chemicals to cool moist air contaminates all of the water vapour condensed. Because only one fifth of the atmosphere passes through the combustion zone, this means you must multiply 16.8 pounds by five to get the total amount of toxified atmosphere created from one pound of Jet A combustion. Add the weight of contaminated condensate on the surface of a contrail which is continually expanding in diameter, and you have a stupendous amount of toxified atmosphere.\nA flight from NY to London uses 10 tons of fuel, I believe, so you can work out how much acidified, ozone laden, poly-synergetic toxins are produced by thousands of flights a day, and the massive potential affects on the hydrological systems by the deposition of intense heat into the altosphere.

Nitrogen is shaken up by its passage through the jet turbine and upon emission, it seems to want to form nitrogen oxides. There is a massive quantity of atmosphere that is passing through the jet engine, and of course, it is all contaminated. These new chemicals are unstable and constantly morphing due to the synergetic effects, so they are, in practice, nearly impossible to classify. However, oxygen, in the form of ozone seems to be attracted to the excited nitrogen to form various types of nitrogen oxide. There is a whole column dedicated to nitrogen oxides in the NASA analysis. \nThe contrail is a coherent, cylindrical spiral of hot exhaust gasses and particulates that increases in diameter as it cools and descends, and due to its temperature and also to the attraction the rotating mass exerts, water vapour condenses readily so long as the contrail remains warmer than the surrounding air. On the outside of the exhaust plume, there is a very large surface area, which is constantly increasing, to condense water vapour. \nThe heat and polluted gasses are exchanged into the water vapour resulting in acid rain, ozone toxicity, and the fallout is cancer producing, cause asthma, and robs the entire atmospheric blanket of water vapour, which it displaces to lower altitudes, thus interrupting the primary hydrological cycle. Also, the missing ozone admits more UV radiation through to the Earth's surface, and undoubtedly this causes the loss of vegetation, and consequently produces more heat. I leave it to your imagination to calculate the effects of so much high altitude water vapour being dragged to lower altitudes while being heated and filled with unknown, and in fact, unknowable chemicals.\nThere are clear solutions to many environmental issues that would transform the planet if initiated.

On some days, no water vapour is present at cruising altitude, on other days there is plenty. The water vapour condensing on a hot contrail is not coming from the combustion of jet fuel. This is why contrails seem to turn off and on. \nThis phenomenon is a result of the aircraft flying through a moist air plume evaporating off of a river or other body of water. If you fly in a prop plane at lower altitudes, you can feel the bump of denser, water laden air coming up from every river that is crossed. \nWe are also told that jet contrails are formed from ice crystals and water vapour, but this does not include the hundreds of toxic compounds in the jet exhaust which exchange into the water vapour on the outside of the contrail. \nThis of course contaminates the water vapour and is most likely the primary cause of the growing incidence of cancer. There are seven well known carcinogens in jet exhaust, but there are certainly many more also. The azure blue skies seen since the jets have been grounded is proof that contrail pollution is present in the entire atmospheric blanket.

Its findings have been consistently misrepresented and/or politicized with each succeeding report.‚Äù\n    Dr Rosa Compagnucci: ‚ÄúHumans have only contributed a few tenths of a degree to warming on Earth. Solar activity is a key driver of climate.‚Äù\n    Dr Richard Courtney: ‚ÄúThe empirical evidence strongly indicates that the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis is wrong.‚Äù\n    Dr Judith Curry: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to just spout off and endorse the IPCC because I don‚Äôt have confidence in the process.‚Äù\n    Dr Robert Davis: ‚ÄúGlobal temperatures have not been changing as state of the art climate models predicted they would. Not a single mention of satellite temperature observations appears in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers.‚Äù\n    Dr Willem de Lange: ‚ÄúIn 1996 the IPCC listed me as one of approximately 3000 ‚Äúscientists‚Äù who agreed that there was a discernible human influence on climate. I didn‚Äôt. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that runaway catastrophic climate change is due to human activities.‚Äù\n    Dr Chris de Freitas: ‚ÄúGovernment decision-makers should have heard by now that the basis for the long-standing claim that carbon dioxide is a major driver of global climate is being questioned; along with it the hitherto assumed need for costly measures to restrict carbon dioxide emissions. If they have not heard, it is because of the din of global warming hysteria that relies on the logical fallacy of ‚Äòargument from ignorance‚Äô and predictions of computer models.‚Äù\nDr Oliver Frauenfeld: ‚ÄúMuch more progress is necessary regarding our current understanding of climate and our abilities to model it.‚Äù\nDr Peter Dietze: ‚ÄúUsing a flawed eddy diffusion model, the IPCC has grossly underestimated the future oceanic carbon dioxide uptake.‚Äù\nDr John Everett: ‚ÄúIt is time for a reality check. The oceans and coastal zones have been far warmer and colder than is projected in the present scenarios of climate change. I have reviewed the IPCC and more recent scientific literature and believe that there is not a problem with increased acidification, even up to the unlikely levels in the most-used IPCC scenarios.‚Äù\nDr Eigil Friis-Christensen: ‚ÄúThe IPCC refused to consider the sun‚Äôs effect on the Earth‚Äôs climate as a topic worthy of investigation. The IPCC conceived its task only as investigating potential human causes of climate change.‚Äù\nDr Lee Gerhard: ‚ÄúI never fully accepted or denied the anthropogenic global warming concept until the furore started after NASA‚Äôs James Hansen‚Äôs wild claims in the late 1980s. I went to the [scientific] literature to study the basis of the claim, starting with first principles. My studies then led me to believe that the claims were false.‚Äù\nDr Indur Goklany: ‚ÄúClimate change is unlikely to be the world‚Äôs most important environmental problem of the 21st century. There is no signal in the mortality data to indicate increases in the overall frequencies or severities of extreme weather events, despite large increases in the population at risk.‚Äù\nDr Vincent Gray: ‚ÄúThe [IPCC] climate change statement is an orchestrated litany of lies.‚Äù\nDr Mike Hulme: ‚ÄúClaims such as ‚Äò2500 of the world‚Äôs leading scientists have reached a consensus that human activities are having a significant influence on the climate‚Äô are disingenuous ‚Ä¶ The actual number of scientists who backed that claim was only a few dozen.‚Äù\nDr Kiminori Itoh: ‚ÄúThere are many factors which cause climate change. Considering only greenhouse gases is nonsense and harmful.‚Äù\nDr Yuri Izrael: ‚ÄúThere is no proven link between human activity and global warming. I think the panic over global warming is totally unjustified. There is no serious threat to the climate.‚Äù\nDr Steven Japar: ‚ÄúTemperature measurements show that the climate model-predicted mid-troposphere hot zone is non-existent. This is more than sufficient to invalidate global climate models and projections made with them.‚Äù\nDr Georg Kaser: ‚ÄúThis number [of receding glaciers reported by the IPCC] is not just a little bit wrong, it is far out by any order of magnitude ‚Ä¶ It is so wrong that it is not even worth discussing.‚Äù\nDr Aynsley Kellow: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not holding my breath for criticism to be taken on board, which underscores a fault in the whole peer review process for the IPCC: there is no chance of a chapter [of the IPCC report] ever being rejected for publication, no matter how flawed it might be.‚Äù\nDr Madhav Khandekar: ‚ÄúI have carefully analysed adverse impacts of climate change as projected by the IPCC and have discounted these claims as exaggerated and lacking any supporting evidence.‚Äù\nDr Hans Labohm: ‚ÄúThe alarmist passages in the IPCC Summary for Policymakers have been skewed through an elaborate and sophisticated process of spin-doctoring.‚Äù\nDr Andrew Lacis: ‚ÄúThere is no scientific merit to be found in the Executive Summary. The presentation sounds like something put together by Greenpeace activists and their legal department.‚Äù\nDr Chris Landsea: ‚ÄúI cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound.‚Äù\nDr Richard Lindzen: ‚ÄúThe IPCC process is driven by politics rather than science. It uses summaries to misrepresent what scientists say and exploits public ignorance.‚Äù\nDr Harry Lins: ‚ÄúSurface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. The case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated.‚Äù\nDr Philip Lloyd: ‚ÄúI am doing a detailed assessment of the IPCC reports and the Summaries for Policy Makers, identifying the way in which the Summaries have distorted the science. I have found examples of a summary saying precisely the opposite of what the scientists said.‚Äù\nDr Martin Manning: ‚ÄúSome government delegates influencing the IPCC Summary for Policymakers misrepresent or contradict the lead authors.‚Äù\nSteven McIntyre: ‚ÄúThe many references in the popular media to a ‚Äòconsensus of thousands of scientists‚Äô are both a great exaggeration and also misleading.‚Äù\nDr Patrick Michaels: ‚ÄúThe rates of warming, on multiple time scales, have now invalidated the suite of IPCC climate models. No, the science is not settled.‚Äù\nDr Nils-Axel Morner: ‚ÄúIf you go around the globe, you find no sea level rise anywhere.‚Äù\nDr Johannes Oerlemans: ‚ÄúThe IPCC has become too political. Many scientists have not been able to resist the siren call of fame, research funding and meetings in exotic places that awaits them if they are willing to compromise scientific principles and integrity in support of the man-made global-warming doctrine.‚Äù\nDr Roger Pielke: ‚ÄúAll of my comments were ignored without even a rebuttal. At that point, I concluded that the IPCC Reports were actually intended to be advocacy documents designed to produce particular policy actions, but not a true and honest assessment of the understanding of the climate system.‚Äù\nDr Paul Reiter: ‚ÄúAs far as the science being ‚Äòsettled,‚Äô I think that is an obscenity. The fact is the science is being distorted by people who are not scientists.‚Äù\nDr Murry Salby: ‚ÄúI have an involuntary gag reflex whenever someone says the science is settled. Anyone who thinks the science is settled on this topic is in fantasia.‚Äù\nDr Tom Segalstad: ‚ÄúThe IPCC global warming model is not supported by the scientific data.‚Äù\nDr Fred Singer: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it remarkable that the Policymakers Summary of the IPCC report avoids mentioning the satellite data altogether, or even the existence of satellites ‚Äî probably because the data show a slight cooling over the last 18 years, in direct contradiction of the calculations from climate models?‚Äù\nDr Hajo Smit: ‚ÄúThere is clear cut solar-climate coupling and a very strong natural variability of climate on all historical time scales. Currently I hardly believe anymore that there is any relevant relationship between human CO2 emissions and climate change.‚Äù\nDr Richard Tol: ‚ÄúThe IPCC attracted more people with political rather than academic motives. In AR4, green activists held key positions in the IPCC and they succeeded in excluding or neutralising opposite voices.‚Äù\nDr Tom Tripp: ‚ÄúThere is so much of a natural variability in weather it makes it difficult to come to a scientifically valid conclusion that global warming is man made.‚Äù\nDr Gerd-Rainer Weber: ‚ÄúMost of the extremist views about climate change have little or no scientific basis.‚Äù\nDr David Wojick: ‚ÄúThe public is not well served by this constant drumbeat of alarms fed by computer models manipulated by advocates.‚Äù\nDr Miklos Zagoni: ‚ÄúI am positively convinced that the anthropogenic global warming theory is wrong.‚Äù\nDr Eduardo Zorita: ‚ÄúEditors, reviewers and authors of alternative studies, analysis, interpretations, even based on the same data we have at our disposal, have been bullied and subtly blackmailed.‚Äù", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Joe Cox", "channel": "UCokMzz38HtwcfZ1_vGJjnLw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSWPi6hXjIXezNcA3Mtnh_f4Fx39ciB2wipKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwtqNEIG8leHobf_c54AaABAg.9KA88M-OTJL9KZuwOjs1iy", "text": "¬†@Masada2¬† Archbishop Ussher came up with the date 2349 BC, and his scholarship was remarkable for 1650 AD. Several decades later, Sir Isaac Newton came up with his own biblical timeline, very similar to that of Ussher. Both timelines are wrong. How do we know? Because of evidence created by God, Himself.\n\nQuestion: Why did Jesus teach with difficult-to-understand, NON-literal parables? He also said that the way is narrow and difficult. Yet, there are Christian teachers, today, who lie to their flock with sweet words of laziness and superiority, pretending that the way is really a location and the difficulty is really easy. You do NOT want to be standing before God on Judgement Day, trying to excuse your ignorance with, \"But my church leaders taught...\" The responsibility for your salvation is yours. You get to choose whether or not you will follow Christ. So far, you're following your church leaders who are leading you astray.\n\nAbout 2340 BC (your date), Egypt's 6th Dynasty had already begun, tens of thousands of Egyptians getting busy to serve a new Pharaoh. In another 5 years, Sargon the Great would be conquering Sumer, on his way to building an empire which stretched from the mountains of modern Iran to the Mediterranean.\n\nQuestion: If Noah's Flood happened then, where did all those other people come from? Obviously, the date is wrong.\n\nBiblical literalism is a toxic bunch of lies. Jesus rebuked the biblical literalists of his day -- the Pharisees and Sadducees. The New Testament warns against biblical literalism, telling us that the letter (or \"ink\") leads to death, but the spirit of scripture leads to life. But that takes work and humility. Sadly, too many modern believers are too lazy and arrogant to work for the spirit. They would rather rest on the \"ink.\"\n\nNoah's Flood targeted a very specific species which died at the real Flood date of 27,970 BC. The clues are in Genesis, if you know how to find them. The wording \"days were ... years\" is part of the clue. The wording of Genesis 6:3 is another part. And Genesis 5:2 gives yet another clue.\n\nIn Genesis 2, God told Adam that he could eat of every tree but one. If he were to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he would surely die on that day. Remember this? And at the end of Genesis 3, both Adam and Eve are escorted out of the Garden. In Genesis 5, we learn that Adam lived for 930 \"years\" which were \"days.\" What happened to Adam \"dying on the day\" he ate of the forbidden fruit?\n\nBiblical literalists say that the death in the Garden was physical, but it wasn't, for Adam lived for 930 years AFTER the Garden. Literalists say that the death in the Garden means that death did not exist on Earth before then. Wrong again. The death in the Garden was spiritual. The forbidden fruit was physical ego -- the false self which is the \"master\" of this realm -- the source of all evil. Why would God do this? So that we could use our free will to choose to be closer to Him. And by doing so, we go from being \"receivers\" (female) to \"givers\" (male), for it is more blessed to give than to receive. We were created in His image, and God is NOT Homo sapiens!!! Stop being literal about the Bible. Jesus was not. If you are to follow him, you need to stop being literal. Spirit is like nothing in the physical realm.\n\nReference: The Bible's Hidden Wisdom", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Rod Martin, Jr.", "channel": "UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTBcLgEgFRec3cg93TXwvv14L2fOoJDMZDAF9Lz=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
