Also, he used the phrase something along of \"[when 9 doctors says smoking is bad, why are you listening to the one who says it's okay]\"; well, he just shot himself in the fucking foot by saying that, because the vast majority of scientist disagree that it's likely humans contribute in a significant way to global warming. There is not enough conclusive evidence/data, as in they follow EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, as all scientists should, but something climate researchers usually don't! The world is warming, we should pollute much less, but the 90-97% of [whatever] agree [...]; that movement is more or less bullshit. Sure, humans might be contributing to global warming in a significant way, but that movement is bullshit! Not only do they censor who gets into the \"circle\" those percentages are based on, but they arbitrary decide if a paper is for or against humans and global warming; EVEN AGAINST the author(s) wishes, when they say it's not saying anything about the matter, for example!\n\nRemember the Ozone danger? Yeah, it was manipulation on the highest level! Media showed pictures of the ozone in the past compared to the that time present date, where the present date had a huge hole. The manipulation was that the difference was that one was at day(side) and the other was at night, and at night, the hole on the night side of the planet will always be huge, because ozone both are drawn and created on the dayside of the planet! OFC the hole would look huge, but they hid all facts about what time of day it was, as it was a \"radar map\"... Yeah, cause timestamps are never on those!\n\nHumans need to pollute less, not only regarding climate gases, but everything really! We might not have any control of global warming, but we should try to not make more of the planet lifeless or life unagreeable! We have more or less wiped out several species already; before it might have been for other reasons, but today, pure capitalism is perhaps what disagrees the most with being environmentally friendly. What is wrong with using a smartphone for 2 or more years? When companies make products that fail on purpose, just after the warranty is out, or doesn't really offer warranty, perhaps just blames the customer no matter what;we get a lot of waste from that sector alone, for those and other reasons...

Oh and it should once again be noted that the world has been hotter than it is right now and humans were not around, yet the Earth survived. Increased heat also means more evaporation from the oceans, which means more rain, which could resolve the issues we have with the drying regions of the planet. For example the Sahara desert has been growing and this is of great concern, but recently there has been an increasing amount of vegetation due to the rainfall and it may very well be the desertification could begin to reverse. Even better we now have several regions on the African continent where the people had experienced years of drought and the increased rainfall is making their lives livable again. \n\nSo yeah, if you're going to report on climate change it's probably a good idea to cover the full spectrum of effects.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Laughing Achilles", "channel": "UCwdXWvfms6wYHpa5weG6xqg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT8ztm7eqGtt19vmSHKp-3Y63-9TUZEVZeI8w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That said, I don't care about the planet anymore, it will be fine, We, Humans, will be gone and the earth will just go on, life will go on without us and adapt (though many species will perish sadly), and it will just be very, very warm, until the next ice age occurs. It will sort itself out, question is will we be here still? Probably not, certainly not the number of people we have alive now, maybe a generous half, if even. I don't see any change happening until we run very low on fossil fuels, enough to scare people into action, i'd settle for nuclear power at this point in that scenario. Fact is, it's not so much save the planet, or save the environment, it's more like save humans and some other species from going extinct. As I said earlier though.. I just find the effort futile at this point, and would rather just enjoy the time I have left, but keep on fighting the good fight, those who still have the energy to care. I personally, have just given up on people in general, except for a few exceptional people who make me feel like giving people another chance, and then trump opens his mouth again, or a flat-earther posts, or some anti-vax lunatic and I can't be fucking bothered to care again.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lord Inquisitor Skorn", "channel": "UCdfKzbPggA68d51ffMBUInA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQDJohaMil-HMMScXmZpgvv2r2y5ZUez3TrIuG2-A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

A lot of the sludge that makes up what we call fossil fuel is from certain fibrous materials that never got eaten after the lifeforms died as there were no bacterias capable of eating that fibrous material for what appears to have been a very long time. An evidently sizeable proportion of organic matter from the remains of dead organisms just sat their without being almost immediately consumed as it would be today, and got buried as time went on.\n\nHence why there's so much sludge of organic matter buried down there.\n\nTrees are one of the major extractors of carbon from the atmosphere and have always been, that branch of life (the chloroplast branch as opposed to our own mitochondrial branch) has always generated its own energy supply by harvesting carbon from the air, and they also build themselves from it.\n\nA forest fire releases a lot of the carbon that forest had extracted. A large forest fire obviously releases more and there will be a period of time where the carbon is in the air before it gets absorbed again by life which in turn causes the temperature to drop and other mechanisms to switch to extracting carbon instead of releasing stored carbon.\n\nWhat then is going to be the effect of releasing all the carbon from what was once a planet wide absorption that never got re-released?\n\nNow, I'm not a person who sees this as something that will kill life on earth. Quite the contrary. Life does better in the hotter temperatures our surface might reach and carbon is food for chloroplast based creatures which in turn are food for many mitochondrial creatures. Plus higher temperatures means more water in the atmosphere which means more rain and so forth.\n\nThe end result of us making the temperature soar upwards on earth will be more life on earth. Provided we don't over harvest everything and create deserts where rainforests could be.\n\nHowever, there will be a period where life forms that are not capable of adapting will die off en masse. We might be highly adaptable but other creatures are much much more sensitive to minor shifts in the ecosystem to the point that major shifts are catastrophic. \n\nThis will inevitably lead to a chain of starvation throughout our biome's. \n\nThat and the loss of land is what anyone with a lick of common sense is scared of.\n\nAll these apocalypse earth scenarios (i.e. earth will become a new venus) are just as silly as all the denialism that anything we humans would call bad is going to happen.\n\nIt's going to get rough and frankly we'll probably end up having a war kick off that makes the world wars look like a playground scuffle because for all the brilliance some humans can display humans in general are fucking stupid.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "More Please", "channel": "UCl7fyCbRmbQi6jSxR_5Oedw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRuLgg5KFrDe7iV4xWy-t7QIvMSP231bqYKDA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Which just shows how ignorant and stupid you are. \nFlat Earthers have dismantled all the so called proof of the globe. \n\nYour globe is pseudoscience. Go look up the defintion of the word. All of your \"proof\" isn't based on the scientific method. Because it's not science. \n\nTake gravity for example. Gravity is your assumed cause. So that makes it the independent variable. But it can't be because you can't manipulate gravity to see if it causes a change in your observed phenomena or the dependent variable. Which in this case would be objects falling. So you cannot establish a cause and effect relationship with gravity and falling objects. That's what science is. Science establishes cause and effect relationships and to do that they use the scientfic method. \n\nThe Cavendish experiment is just pseudoscience. The only fair way to do that experiment would be to have lead balls suspended by nothing in a realm of nothing. Because it's impossible to do without another body of mass present at all times. So the mass of the two balls can't be isolated from other mass to accurately prove that mass attracts mass. \n\nThe scientific method for the cavendish experiment would be as follows. Your dependent variable would be a torsion bar turning and not mass attracting mass. The independent variable would be the mass of the objects. It would be intellectually dishonest to say that the observed phenomena is mass attracting mass. When what you see is a torsion bar turning. You don't see mass attracting mass outside of the Cavendish experiment. I should be able to put a giant wrecking ball next to a ping pong ball and see the ping pong ball move toward the wrecking ball. The Cavendish experiment has had no attempts from science to be falsified. It's just been accepted as true. It doesn't prove gravity.

{"cid": "UgzWvpsdJuLtckivUMV4AaABAg", "text": "So many fucking morons!!!  Here is a short little story I wrote in about 20 minutes.  There is literally a ton of evidence in itself if you truly understand what is written...\n\nThe short story of a pet rock:\n\n  Once upon time there was a rock.  It was a lonely rock.  Always laying on the groung wishing it could be a piece of sand or perhahps just a tiny pebble.  Alas, Rock was too big, water nor wind could move him.  He admired the pebbles because though nothing but a strong wind could move them, water seemed to sweep them by.  Sand, oh how he dreamed of being sand.  To fly through the air, to swim through the water, oh what a dream it would be.  But Rock is too big, never moving.  As the ground around him erodes, he ever more tortured as more and more smaller materials surface and move away from him.  Oh how Rock wishes he wasn't so big.  Even his size doesn't make him sink, but that which erodes around him exposes more of his size.\n\n  What Rock doesn't realize, is that over time, air and water will soon make him a pebble and then a piece of sand and his dream will come true but he doesn't have the patience for this.  The wind never stops and covers all of Earth, ripping complete sections from each other.  The rain cycle will always continue dropping it's water on the highest slopes so it can travel downard or begin collecting itself at the equilibrium point, sea level.  The sun will always move causing thermal chaos.  Rock will always remain at REST, never being pulled down any farther than the more dense material(land) will allow it and never going up because it is heavier than the surrounding material(air).\n\n  Alas, more time has passed.  So much time has passed that Rock has actually gotten smaller.  Rock also notices a new species.  They are funny looking and they can move themselves.  Oh how Rock wishes he could be one.  Rock is also amazed at how when these creatures step on sand or pebble, they tend to move out of their way and/or get smashed further into the land.  Then Rock sees the creature pick pebble up and throw him.  In Rock's amazement, pebble arches through the air and splashes into the water sinking out of sight, landing on the floor and once again coming to rest until the water decides to move him.  Now Rock is really jealous.  Then all of a sudden the creature eyes Rock!  Rock is nervous.  He doesn't know what to expect.  The creature slowly walks towards Rock, eyeing him all the way.  Rock does what he does best and sits there, motionless.  The creature picks him up.  Rock is amazed!!!  He is in motion!!!  Rock askes the creature, \"What are you?\".  The creature responds, \"I am Human\".  The Rock smiles.  The creature then puts rock into his pocket and walks off into the distance...\n   \n  And all because of Mr. Pressure and his secret friend, Mr. Temperature.  The nerve of them!  Without Mr.  Pressure, Rock would of never formed.  Without Mr. Temperature everything would of remained in a state of equilbrium thereby causing no motion which made Rock jealous to begin with.  It is the constant motion of the sun and it's counterpart Mr. Temperature that causes thermal convection which produces wind which in turns develops pressure at the same time.  You can't have one without the other.  Mr. Pressure creates Mr. Temperature and Mr. Temperature creates Mr. Pressure.   You also can't have a pressurized atmosphere without a container/holder regardless of it's composition...", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Elkysium", "channel": "UCnDDE05Xv4YoyMQ5vN71EnA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCWoT5fD6wzAqWYngU2jk0_iQtjJBWlH1ZZmho=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you look at the end of the last major glaciation, the sea levels rose rapidly flooding many areas, which is why we have global stories of floods across all cultures. When the tipping comes, it will be very rapid. To hold the temperature to a 2 degree rise as the IPC suggests, we would have to cut global production and resource usage by about 95%, much better to invest in technologies that enable us to roll with climate change rather than return to medieval levels of living.\n\nCO2 levels have been around the 200 parts per million (ppm) and have recently risen to 400 ppm. Below 150 ppm plants die. The earths average CO2 levels is somewhere around 1000 ppm. Commercial greenhouse growers like to keep CO2 levels of around 800 ppm in order to ensure a good supply of CO2 for the plants and to increase crop yields. Man has been responsible for approximately 34 ppm of the rise from 200 to 400 ppm\n\nAlso your comment about the change rate is much faster than it ever was. That is based on the fact that two distinct and disparate data sets are being used. The first one is based on ice core samples, plus geological records where many years are stored close together. Whereas what climate change alarmists are using is data from the past 300 years from temperature gauges in mostly the developed west. Many of the gauges recording the highest increases are due to the fact that towns have expanded and the gauges are no longer rural. Think of heating a pan of water, it heats up very slowly until a critical point is reached, and then you get quick rise to boiling point. That's what happens with climate change.\n\nAnd no scientist will be funded in the climate sciences unless they at least pay lip service to the man-made climate change myth, and say that they buy into it. Just look at the careers of those who said they saw no evidence in their field, now they always add a proviso.\n\nSo yes we are having an effect, but the overall effect is minimal and the climate has always changed. Perhaps try looking up megafauna and dinosaurs to see what a truly hot climate produces.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Little Albioner", "channel": "UCqFCd-Zw5XFUGwPXisvzrUQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT_HvGOoOe_zQquGg6kaqJCKYNtQ6fEla4e7Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Then you have all the other ways species are interconnected and rely on each other for survival, i.e. kill insects and you will indirectly kill plants. There's a level of balance in nature and it doesn't recover immediately when that balance goes tits up.\n\nI'm pretty sure the argument 'but the world's been hot in the past' is going to mean jackshit to anyone starving cos for some reason almost all the nearby food sources in the area disappeared after a starvation shock wave passed through the local eco-system", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "More Please", "channel": "UCl7fyCbRmbQi6jSxR_5Oedw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRuLgg5KFrDe7iV4xWy-t7QIvMSP231bqYKDA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The MatheMagics for the globe doesn't work in the real world, only on paper..\n\n2. Why do ALL space agencies BLATANTLY lie with cgi and myriads of discrepancies EVERYWHERE?\n\n3.water ALWAYS maintains level.. Hence 'horizon'.. NOT curvizon!!\n\n4. At what point does the magic of gravity take over when buildings üè¢ tilt with people in them?....... \n............................. Exactly!! \n\n..\n\nSo um let's get this into perspective.. \n\nTurning 1000mph\nOrbiting 66,600mph \nOn arm of the milkway 550,000mph\nSpace junk here's a quote from nasa - \n More than 500,000 pieces of debris, or ‚Äúspace junk,‚Äù are tracked as they orbit the Earth. They all travel at speeds up to 17,500 mph.. - end quote.. (only ever seen in cgi) \n\nAnd satellite - \nThis definition makes our count much less because it includes only spacecraft and not debris that orbits the Earth. The Goddard Space Flight Center's lists 2,271 satellites currently in orbit. Russia has the most satellites currently in orbit, with 1,324 satellites, followed by the U.S. with 658 üõ∞ - end quote  (only ever seen in cgi)\n\nAnd the üöÄ rocket goes 17,500mph to break the gravitational pull of the earth.. Mmm OK that's some serious G's Being pulled there.. Going 87 football fields per sec..... \n\nMmmm ü§î üí≠... Of course they are, \n\nBasically absurdity at its best. BALLSHIT üí©.. \nAlso what's with the harnesses and generous abouts of hair spray.. Also, what's with Neil degrARSEse Lyson or is it that fishey fisheye lens nasa loves making it a spheroid üåç.. Pear üçê Oblate.. Which is it, It's flat, that's what it is.  \n\nSo again, Like how the fuck can you believe (not know with great or even simple evidence) we're turning at 1000mph. orbiting 66,600mph whilst on the arm of the milky-way way at 550,000mph and being dragged by the sun?\n\nOr a timepiece like a clock above etc the night sky the sun ‚òÄ and ‚òΩ moon hands of the clock üïí and its all one big torus field/s.. Geocentric... And all revolves around you? \nNow remember.. You are also a measurement of the You'niverse..\nTorus fields..\nTorso\nUterus.. UTorus..\n\n... Stop letting sinister Sorcerer's take your senses away and feed you utter crap and to  your family and friends..\nFor you though you're probably a paid shills, trolls etc... Basically GTFFOH \n\nI guess you think there is a Tesla in space üòÇ ffs...\n\n\nAlso, \nFor those that haven't thought from this angle... Why?\n\nWhy would they lie about everything youve been told, and even the place we live? \nWhy are people lost and kids stabbing etc Wars and mental health the rest happening Pretty simple!!! \n\nIt's all a mind skism.. Mind games.. Hence why if 'THEY' tell you your lost going through the cosmos and corkscrewing and the rest via the implementation of the heliocentric model.. Think what that does to the minds.. \n\nThen to have a weak emulations of doctrines and bibles that actually are merely analogies and metaphor about energy and torus fields etc... But although I say weak emulations it's very close to what it's taken from (you, nature, cosmos) which in turn attracts you then you'll develop conviction. \n\nYou got your yin yang the polarisation components of you body/spiritual.. \nSo.. Left right.. Male female.. estrogen testosterone.. \nBetween those is your mind and just above that your unlimited ultra vast in every way possible CONSCIOUSNESS.. \n\nSo.. If you're given a fake or plagiarise scriptures or the school indoctrination system how can you find you way when the trianglation point that been put above yin yang etc leads you NOWHERE... a false phantom has been place there... \n\nThink Tesseract.. We're the processors and projectors of the reality.. So if all in you head is what they want and you manifest it whilst THEY LIVE kick back and relax as you bickering on confusion and scraps from the \"THEY LIVE\" oppressors table.. \n\nHence why they want you looking everywhere but within self... Like Fake nasa!!! ... All is SELF ‚öõ..\n\nIt's all a mind skism.. Mind games.. Hence why if they tell/teach you your lost going through the cosmos and corkscrewing and the rest via the implementation of the heliocentric model.. Think why that does to the minds.. \n\nThen to have weak emulations of doctrines and bibles that actually are merely analogies and metaphor about energy and torus fields etc... \n\nSo again, You got your yin yang the polarisation components of you body/spiritual.. \nSo.. Left right.. Male female.. estrogen testosterone.. \nBetween those is your mind and just above that your unlimited ultra vast in every way possible CONSCIOUSNESS.. \n\nSo.. If you're given a fake or plagiarise scriptures or the school indoctrination system how can you find your way when the trianglation point that's been put above yin yang etc leads you Nowhere because it's been hijacked!! ... a false phantom package of Russian dolls has been place there... \n.. \n\nWe are dealing with nothing but Psychopathological NarcoPaths that innerstand the nature of esoterics and exoteric alchemy.. That is all. \n\n.. \n... \n\n Just imagine if/when everyone snaps out of the hypnosis and takes their minds and consciousness back, this plane of existence will literally change over night. Think about that. \n\n... \nNow check the play with the practice and crafting of Gematria.. \n\nNote the masonic compass and square the compass set 47 degrees, 23.5 for each compass leg kicked out.. Matching the sun on the tropics of cancer via the Southern Hemisplane and Northern Hemisplane.. As above so below and all that jazz!!! \n\n.. So 'THEY' invert and have externalised in a low watt vibration what is off high vibration and is written in natural nature organically in every creature üêõ , leaf üçÉ and your soul being... \n\nSun/Son worship energy that's syphoned and funnelled off to Saturn whilst completely messing with your frequency signature (your frequency sign in nature) \n.. Saturn isn't bad but if say your honing onto 180 degrees of bad shit rather than 360 wholeness to have balance you gonna have a problem like what 'THEY' their offkey frequency has developed into... \n\nSo... (and also note the September 23.. 23/9 tie-in too) \nTorah 239\nGolden gate 239\nMoon ‚òΩ supposed 239,000ml away, obviously the moon isn't that far away \n\nPropaganda = 93\n‚òÄ Sun/Son = 93 million supposed miles away!! Obviously the sun ain't that far away!! \nCrucifix 93 (jesus crucified 9-3pm)\nGod's son 93 \nIn Genesis Adam lives til 930yrs \nNazareth 93\nNew testiment 930th chapter \nChristianity 930 (Sumerian) \nSaturn = 93 \nNike ‚úÖ (is Saturns ring) = 39\nBig Apple üçé 39\nTime square 39\n..

Are you suggesting that there is no night during summer?\nBut to answer your insane question as best as I can; the earth moves in a circular orbit around the sun, and the tilt of the earth changes in a set and well observed way as it travels in a full circle around the sun (which takes and is the basis for a year). At a certain point (in late June) the tilt of the earth is such that the northen hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, thus getting it the largest amount of sunlight, while the southern hemisphere gets the least, this is of course reversed come December, when the southern hemisphere has the most light and goes through summer whilst the northern hemisphere goes through winter.\n\nNow, in regards to the whole gravity thing, I don't even know how to argue this, since you're basically saying any evidence to the existence of gravity is 'made up' or something (despite the fact you have no evidence of your own to provide an alternative to gravity, but whatever) but all I can attempt to say is that the sun is a globe, as are the rest of the celestial bodies in our solar system. This you can observe for yourself, just go buy a telescope and fucking look up. A fair reasoning that all these bodies are round is because gravity exists, no? And even if you were to somehow fail to see the logic in that, surely common sense would dictate that if every other observable celestial body is spherical than it should apply to Earth aswell. Furthermore, you can just get a glass, fill it with water, start spinning it around and then hold it upside down. The water will stay in the glass, this is an experiment kids do when they're like 8 come on, man. Water doesn't 'fall off' the earth because of the gravitational force of the centre of the earth, which everything on the Earth is pulled towards. There is absolutely no reason for things to 'fall off' the Earth because there is nothing pulling or pushing them away from its surface.\n\nI mean there is alot more to address but most of what you're saying is either incredibly poorly worded or utter gibberish, probably caused by you attempting to use what you consider 'impressive language' to convince us all that you're smart.\nThat's the thing with flat earthers, you're all so stuck up in your own heads that you can't even concieve that someone knows something that you do not. That's the whole reason the flat earth movement exists, a bunch of questions that couldn't easily be answered with common knowledge were posed, of course most people didn't have the knowhow to answer these questions but actual trained proffessionals in the field did, and though most people didn't understand they were content to accept their findings. People like you also can't understand what they said, but the difference you're all such egomaniacs that you find it impossible to accept there are people that know more than you, that there are things you've never studied that you don't understand. Instead you come to the conclusion that \"because I can't explain it, it must be untrue!\" and then go ahead and jump on the bandwagon when it offers a solution that makes you able to validate your self perception of being a genius and special.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SirSlippy Of IDK", "channel": "UCLiSFQwUAelzFB5rL2MuLrw", "votes": "10", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ0sJHqWzADLFeRcHLHzKqXF7Pk17sVdWMV2bI5=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We can mathematically prove beyond reasonable doubt that celestial bodies are spheres due to support from observations and how well it fits in with current theories in regards to how th e universe is formed. This is not just \"being told\" how things are and passively accepting it, this is being presented with theories and findings from experts in their fields, reviewing it, and going, \"yes, this is the most plausible explanation for this and the evidence strongly suggests this to be true.\" Just because you're too lazy or stupid too do the revision yourself doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\nBesides which what proof do you have that the Earth is flat? By your logic, you have literally know proof either, because I can just claim anything you claim to be proof is a \"statement without proof\".\n\n\"Do others know things I don't know? Yes.\" So you accept that there are people who know things you don't, but you refuse to believe that an astrologist, physicist, or geologist knows more than you on the nature of the planet? How does that work?\n\n\"You can only see one face of the Moon\" If you get a powerful enough telescope (and I don't mean NASA level or anything, just a powerful commercial telescope) than you can see in detail the curvature of the moon, film that on a timelapse and you will see the moon turn. It really is that simple sometimes. Of course you don't accept this because you don't own a telescope, and any footage I present you with would be somehow fabricated so therefore you refute its existence.\n\n\"If it takes a year to go around the sun then halfway through the year we should be look out to a totally different night sky\" I think this outlines pretty well that you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about. We do see the night sky differently throughout the year, constellations change and sometimes disappear altogether for a while, and the positions of the stars themselves change. I don't even know how to respond to this better than \"yeah\" because it's true and only serves to prove you've done no research of your own into this and are just spouting whatever you heard and whatever first comes to mind when presented with a contradiction.\n\n\"If the moon takes one month to go around the earth then you would never see a crecent moon at night and never see a gibbous or full moon during the day\" ...and that's because why exactly? I'm not sure what you're talking about or how this has any relevance to the Moon or Earth being a sphere.\n\nUltimately flat earth \"theory\" makes no sense, and isn't backed by any scientific evidence, instead relying bizarrely on the possibility of the null hypothesis of a globe earth being true, and using that possibility as 'evidence'.\nI mean, follow common sense, why would the government try to hide the fact that the Earth is flat? It must cost an exorbinate amount of money to do so.\nIs it to hide the existence of God? But what would be the point of that? especially since Earth has been predominantly Christian/Islamic for its entire history, quite militantly aswell until very recently.\nIs it to hide the existence of lands unknown beyond the 'ice wall'? Again to what avail? So people won't go there? Why is that such a threat? Surely various countries could have simply colonised the land and expanded both their power, influence and access to resources by revealing its existence.\nThe entire theory is a nonsensical byproduct of people believing they know everything in our society, with less and less trust being placed in those who actually specialise in the subjects covered.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "SirSlippy Of IDK", "channel": "UCLiSFQwUAelzFB5rL2MuLrw", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ0sJHqWzADLFeRcHLHzKqXF7Pk17sVdWMV2bI5=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Students, and even teachers, often confuse mass and density. The words heavy and light on their own refer to mass, and not density. For density, you also need to consider the size, or volume, of the object.\nBefore you can understand density you need to know about mass and volume.\nMass is the amount of matter in an object.\nMass is always measured on a balance.\nSimply put, Volume is the space that matter takes up.\n\nIn fluid mechanics, the force density is the negative gradient of pressure. It has the physical dimensions of force per unit volume. Force density is a vector field representing the flux density of the hydrostatic force within the bulk of a fluid.\n\nWhen an object is placed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force we call the buoyant force. The buoyant force comes from the pressure exerted on the object by the fluid. Because the pressure increases as the depth increases, the pressure on the bottom of an object is always larger than the force on the top - hence the net upward force.\n\nBuoyancy is the upward force caused by a fluid, such as water. This concept helps to explain why some things float while other objects sink. Buoyancy is an important factor in the design of many objects and in a number of water-based activities, such as boating or scuba diving.\n\nThis same idea helps to determine what will float in water and what will sink. If an object weighs more than the weight of the water it displaces, it will sink. If the object weighs less, it will float. This helps explain why a heavy ship can easily float in the water, while a much smaller and lighter brick will sink quickly. It isn't the size or shape of an object that primarily determines buoyancy, but the relation between an object's weight compared to the weight of the water the object displaces.\n\n\nI do hope this education lesson has now enlightened you somewhat as too what density & buoyancy are, and why \"gravity\" has nothing whatsoever to do with either of them, and can only be found in dictionary's!!!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Martin Allen", "channel": "UCgPIO-Qgf99AKNnsvTOezGA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSrkNnxF0CNAKdZhogp7grOGAdjp7Sz5BHbYAwKKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgylTDYGo1uiXc3fJhV4AaABAg.8jL997C3oEw8jRvbQ2XKN6", "text": "1) Sunlight radiates and is proveably not parallel.\n\nSunlight indeed does radiate, scattering happens throughout the atmosphere, is measurable and follows a set model, see Rayleigh scattering. Experiments that you can do yourself at home confirm that the Rayleigh scattering model is accurate and is actually also used a lot in wireless telecommunications, so if you use a mobile phone, the interference model developed by Rayleigh allows us to understand and design systems around that. So, while light from the sun may not seem 100% parallel, light intensity is incredibly easy and increasingly more accurate to measure in modern day applications (you can buy light dependant resistors or transistors) which only matches the Sun being such a distance away.\n\n2) Two plumbobs square to a level prove simultaneously there is no mass attraction and we are not on a sphere.\n\nHave a look at the current law of universal gravitation and you will see why mass attraction only has visible effects in large masses. I'm quite happy to run you through the derivations if you'd like. Regardless of this fact, Cavendish used a torsion balance back in 1798 to derive the gravitational constant that we use today to an astounding degree of accuracy considering how long ago it was. This torsion balance used actual masses to see the force in laboratory conditions.\n\n\n3) To use Geometry you need an axis x y level and plumb.  We can indeed verify both are straight and true.\n\nThere are many different kinds of geometry, geometry isn't a single principle, it's an entire mathematical field. The x, and y axis is just one type called the cartesian coordinate system (it doesn't actually need a plumb line for its definition, only an x and a y axis/point). On top of this there is also polar coordinate systems, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems, among others. Coordinate systems can be interchanged and are done so in many applications in physics, mathematics and engineering, I'm happy to elaborate more on this if you'd like.\n\n4) Once you can confirm the axis are both straight then you can use Geometry.  If you have no axis then how can you possibly use Geometry and what datum are you using?\n\nThe spherical system rather than an x, y and z system as you are probably used to uses a radius (distance from centre to the point), a polar angle and an azimuth angle instead. Regardless of this fact, you can convert and use both cartesian and spherical coordinate systems interchangeably and there are formulas for conversion.\n\n5) There are no straight lines on a sphere.  If the earth was a sphere and you wanted to make something flat and level you would follow the curvature invert it then split the difference.  Of course noone does this because we do not live on a ball.\n\nThis is splitting hairs but the earth is actually an oblate spheroid not a sphere. Either way, it still has imperfections (mountains and valleys). Though in saying that, if you were to shrink the earth to the size of a basketball, for perspective, Mt Everest would only be 0.3mm off the surface of the basketball, you'd likely not even feel that with your finger if you ran it across. To make a flat surface on earth, we can still use the same method, pick two points and draw a line between them and you have a flat surface, this doesn't change at all. If you want it to be level, you can use a spirit level or a plumbob to check this just as you normally do, the earth being round doesn't change this at all. A large reason that it's so hard to comprehend is because of the sheer size difference between a human and the world, you can have locally flat areas, you can also have hilly areas, but this doesn't mean that as a whole, you can't have a round earth. Think about how large a square mile is, it's quite large, over the entire surface, you'd only have 2 inches of deviation on all sides from the centre over an entire mile. If you drop an ant in a warehouse, does he spend his entire life thinking that the entire world is flat, if you drop him on Mt Everest does he think the entire world is just one never ending hill with no highest point and no lowest point? Obviously local to him, this is all that he sees, all it takes is a look at the bigger picture. \n\n6) Without an axis geometry and vectoring will not work.\n\nIt most definitely does, it works in both coordinate systems and are interchangeable between both, most definitely have a look in a higher level maths textbook to learn about this. \n\nThe verdict is most definitely decided on this one and the maths isn't even close to contended.

NASA doesn't have the credibility as an unquestionable source, it's run by government . Great general sources. Please stick to comedy and don't talk nonsense. There is HUGE debate about climate change beetween climate experts and scientists and there is no majority at all. Most theories proving global warming fail miserably because they just can't create a relation beetween the normal climate change cycle and our impact(probably because there isn't). Big independent climate entities have not reached a decision, and are not even close because of politicians agenda to push \"global warming\". The only consensus is that greenhouse gases contribute to radioactive forcing and sulphate aerosols in the troposphere, but there is no proof whatsoever proving this irrefutably causes global warming. Even the IPCC admits they can't prove or refute climate sceptics because of \"complexities and uncertainties of the science\".   \n\n1 - Climate change never resulted in mass extinctions. Natural cycles, landmass deformation and too much predators (this is way more common than you'd think) for example, are the cause and nothing else.  And yes, climate changes, literally every second, even before we existed.\n\n2 - Temperatures ARE cooling in a lot of places, that's what climate change is, even before the agenda of global warming: the heat waves swap places, therefore new places become hotter, new places become cooler, especially noticeable on tropical countries (including mine) the past 3 summers have been an absolute joke. When I was younger I remember not being able to even breath in the summer of how hot it was, but we miss actually having Summer. Let's see if august is gonna finally be summer. \n\nAbove centuries average, that I can believe and makes sense, still not a cause for concern. Simple methods of agricultural waste disposal and less lazy \"let's dump it in the river it'll be fine\" pretty much would fix our whole impact as humans species since the industrial era in less than 5 years, but it doesn't matter, you'd see climate like it is exactly today, we caused a difference of maybe a single degree celsius and 1 day of more or less summer/winter.\n\n3 - The only impact we have as humans are the agricultural waste (bacteria consuming waste produce CO2) and animal farts. Heat waves will always eventually happen, so will cold weather, so will storms, so will tornados etc etc etc. \nThe literal worst thing we may have caused is making climate a bit more unpredictable, as if climate was ever predictable to begin with.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "insystem7", "channel": "UCTaP4wdGTwIeLjTgeJeTBlA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ662TMnXfYsllZpAp3x5VG8-iR6skudJqqdWmY=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Columbus thought he might approach that place by sailing over this swell in the shape of the planet that could theoretically send him there.

Don't even attempt to respond unless you understand every single aspect as I do because I WILL prove you wrong!!!  You also better read every single word before spouting your theoretical bullshit or stupidity because I can spot either a mile a way.  Don't do like all other morons and ignore the first part of my argument either:\n\nYou want the truth but you can't handle the truth without insults or criticism...\n\nSome choose to follow the side of religion while some choose to follow the side of science.  I follow truth, logic, reason and common sense.  Truth, the infallible facts.  Logic, yes or no, but not always answerable with either. Reason, the power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments.  Common sense, sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.  Both Science and Religion are nothing more than a means to an end and they are both oh so wrong. It can easily be proven, but what is proof?\n\nProof is in the eye of the beholder...\n\nThere are logical proofs, mathematical proofs, pathological proofs, empirical proofs, implied proofs and varied combinations. Each kind of proof assumes that a reader is skilled at the proof type such that they will be affected by the proof into persuasion.\n\nA logic proof assumes that the reader is skilled enough in logic to see the validity being presented. The mathematical proof assumes that the reader is skilled at math. The pathological proof assumes that the reader is emotionally persuaded. The empirical proof assumes that the reader is skilled at analytical observation. The implied proof is based on what is known but not presented.\n\nBut when a proof is given and the reader declares that it is invalid, how does the reader or the poster know whether the perceived invalidity is due to actual invalidity or merely that the reader is not skilled enough in that type of proof? When the reader rebuts the proof, the reader is presuming that he is indeed skilled at the type of proof being presented, just as-the poster presumes that he was skilled enough to present such a proof type.\n\nOr in addition, perhaps the poster and the reader are skilled in the proof type, but either the poster is not skilled at expressing himself in writing, or the reader is simply not very skilled at comprehending what he reads.\n\nHow is one to determine wherein the difficulty lies?\n\nIn any of the cases of rebuttal, if the respondent merely proclaims that the proof is invalid and doesn‚Äôt attempt to point to the exact detail of fallacy, he is merely being confrontational rather than constructive. Thus not giving detail in a rebuttal is clearly not helpful whether the proof is valid or not.\n\nBut even if detail is given and the original poster proclaims that the respondent is wrong, what then?\n\nPerhaps in the proof a poster had made an assertion and a respondent proclaims, ‚Äúthat is subjective‚Äù then the poster replies, ‚Äúno it isn‚Äôt‚Äù. Who is really at fault? Or perhaps the poster has given what he thought was a seriously moving story, but he sees a respondent say, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just silly‚Äù? or \"You need mental Help\"? or how about \"You don't know what you are talking about and haven't proved shit!\"?\n\nIn a political arena, any rebuttal is an attempt to persuade other readers regardless of actual truth value and a varied means of persuasion is likely to be used. This leads to a very complex situation of multiple types of proofs being simultaneously debated because the effort is not to resolve, but to bring down the opponent.\n\nHow does the poster or the respondent really know who was less skilled at the art of persuasion especially if multiple modes of proof were provided??\n\nLet us see...", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Elkysium", "channel": "UCnDDE05Xv4YoyMQ5vN71EnA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCWoT5fD6wzAqWYngU2jk0_iQtjJBWlH1ZZmho=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you make Earth a random creation then you can say that all life was created through evolution out of a primordial goo.  If you remove God you remove the laws He set forth.  You also make His creation, Human Beings, something that is seemingly not important.  By removing these you create a world of possibilities where you can do what you want, act how you want and say what you want without the worry of any repercussions.  When in fact they have grave consequences...\n\nNone of them comprehend that the bible is an idolistic book that gives them a one way ticket. A ticket straight to Hell. Yes there are lots of truths in it, but even they are misunderstood and they are bound in lies. Shall we argue how much profit they make off of these idols? Or how much of God's creation's they destroy just to praise Him? How about the churches which destroy even more of His creations. For what? To house more idols they shouldn't and worship Him? Earth is His church. The largest corporation on Earth is religion...\n\nAlmost all current bibles force you to believe and have faith in a man which is prohibited by our Father. He specifically said, have no faith and trust in no MAN! Remember, nothing currently written is the true word of God, only MAN's interpretations. They have been rewritten and reinterpreted MANY times. If it was the true word of God, they would include the book of Enoch amongst others. This is why the rapture will take all but a handful. They deny the actual truth and they have turned their back on God and His creations(The true nature of Earth and the disregard for it's life). God can not give those chosen eternal life because He has already bestowed it upon all of us to begin with so long as we have FAITH, NOT religion...\n\n32% of 7 billion believe and have faith in a man named \"Jesus\" (the correct name can be argued) whom they believe will bring them salvation, NOT! Salvation lies within your own hands, for it is the choice God gave to us. Of 7 billion Humans, 93% believe in some form of false god/religion. Only 144,000 are supposed to be saved? The 144,000 are God's chosen because they have walked a truly righteous path and followed all of His laws. Many more will be saved if they change their path and have faith in our true Heavenly Father. It's not too late. Jesus was born a man. Lived like a man. Loved like a man. Ate like a man. Bled like a man. Died like a man. \"Jesus\" had FAITH, NOT religion...\n\nComprehend why the rapture will be so high now? Even with so much proof before your very eyes, you still deny it and continue meandering along your false paths through existence (As corporate slaves, job/bill cycle)...\n\nI'll try to explain it another way just in case you don't comprehend the above:\n\nAgain why? Simply put, to keep you trapped in a lie so you make good little slaves and don't question things all while making them lots of profit so they can rule you.  All while making you feel insignificant, when in fact you are the center of the \"universe\" and the greatest creation my God ever created!\n\nGod is where you put your FAITH, not man, not his nor God's creations, nor some pathetic idol. There is only 1 creator period. If there is only 1 God, does it truly matter His name? He will not tolerate any soul that stands by and does nothing and believes in lies. Why do you think He created Heaven and Hell? Hell is a very real place and exists under the plane of Earth(Earth is not a spinning, orbiting globe). Have FAITH in God and BELIEVE in the Son of God for His WAY is the PATH but NOT the ONLY. The PATH not the MAN. Many great men have walked such paths from various cultures but their truths have been twisted in to lies. God isn't a Human period, we were created in His IMAGE. God can not exist in our creation. His essence alone would destroy it. He is never far away though. With your flesh upon the Earth and your voice aloud, He will hear you. As it was meant to be. NOT what religion has made it to be...\n\nThe signs everyone is waiting on and believe some have already happened are not what they think. They think God has put them there specifically so they can see when He will return. What they fail to realize is that they are the results of the consequences of their actions and what they have allowed their governments to do. The signs are not written in stone. The signs will or are happening because our Father has witnessed it already with our last civilization and foretold us of it. What was written was written as a warning and not for what religion has turned it into...\n\nYou will never see me put my faith in a man. You will never see me pray in a corporate environment or in a house which destroys His creations. You will never see me spout scriptures or passages from any idolistic book. My words are my own and they come from within...\n\nGod created us so we can enjoy our lives as we choose in the creation He created for us but you have allowed man to dictate the very nature of your existence...\n\nYou also seem to forget that Satan has free reign to do as he wishes. God will NOT intervene. Your repentance is acknowledged by acknowledging your own sins and not doing them anymore. It is up to you and ONLY you! No one is going to save you or help you to be saved but YOU...  \n\nHe already warned us once, it resulted in total destruction of our last civilization. This time, all will perish, including the Earth. Mountains will fall into their valleys and the Earth itself will be consumed by fire because our arrogance has destroyed it and only those who walk the righteous PATH shall exist again on the new Earth which is born out of the destruction of the old...\n\nTime is running out...", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Elkysium", "channel": "UCnDDE05Xv4YoyMQ5vN71EnA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCWoT5fD6wzAqWYngU2jk0_iQtjJBWlH1ZZmho=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgxTUUjIuGTdKkvGWsB4AaABAg.8jKm6-krP4j8j_ysQLyHRE", "text": "Activating Elkysium's Troll Guard:\n\nLet's deconstruct this so all can see Satan's illusion:\n\n1st The farther you go up the colder it gets. The farther you go down the hotter it gets. Whenever two opposing temperatures (energies) exist there must always be an equilibrium point. This is essentially sea level. Figuratively speaking, that's 12 up and 12 down. Because of these temperature differences pressure is created resulting in pockets of highs and lows which maintains this balance. Remember we live in an enclosed system, regardless of that enclosures properties...\n\n2nd The only way we can have a vacuum is in a device capable of holding it. A vacuum is a void, nothingness.  Nothing can not exist.  A vacuum is a negative atmoshperic reading.  A vacuum is naturally impossible.  If \"space\" is a vacuum, which it isn't, what is the enclosure for space? Only the most extreme and lightest elements exist here. Elements with sparsely packed molecules. A vacuum can not exist naturally. The only way you can prove a vacuum exists is in a shop with something made by man...\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum\n\n3rd Now that we have established that \"space\" isn't a vacuum (underscore in 2) but a lack there of. But even with a lack of, there is still something. Just because none of us understand it doesn't mean it isn't there and that it doesn't exist. In ancient times, part of this substance was known as Aether. A substance which couldn't be brought back to Earth without it's destruction...\n\n4th Now that we have established that \"space\" has substance (Bold in 2 & 3), hence a medium which sound can travel, even if it is so faint we can't hear with our own ears, we can therefore prove no motion to Earth period. All comets and objects that travel in space have tails. The result of the resistance in space. They call it solar winds ROFLMAO! Regardless it still proves that there is resistance or some form of opposing force to create these extremely long tails. Where is Earth's tail? The Moon's? For that matter any of the \"planets\" or \"moons\"...\n\n5th Now that we have established that there is no motion to Earth we can therefore prove that nothing has left Earth.  Earth orbits the sun at 67,000 mph.  The fastest spacecraft speed is 36,000 mph.  Since we have proved there is resistance in space in 4, how can anything man made survive a 31,000+ mph shear force?  I also guess we forgot we live in an enclosed system again.  One of the properties of our enclosure is a \"plasma belt\" which emits deadly amounts of radiation.  We currently do not have any technology that can penetrate it.  If we could it wouldn't be able to be moved let alone fly.  That belt being known as the Van Allen Belt...\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/Van-Allen-radiation-belt\n\n6th While we are at it, I guess we don't truly understand the concept or properties of magnetism.  To add to our 5th argument and further prove what has already been established, how can Earth generate a magnetic field strong enough to do anything when the temperature won't allow for it?  Another words it is too damn hot down there for magnetism to work.  10x greater than the curie temperature...\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/Curie-point\n\nElectromagnetism is called such because it uses electricity to create a magnetic field. Otherwise it would just be called magnetism. Show me a constant electrical source on Earth. There are tons of effects which are electrical in nature but none of them constant. Yes I know all about the electric \"universe\" theory, but there is no \"universe\", just Earth and it's enclosure then God's realm. According to science, Earth's rotation is what causes it's magnetic field but there is no motion to Earth period. There is ONLY 1 measurable magnetic source and it is in the north. Nothing else is magnetic in nature whatsoever as far as a massive force like in the north. Your compass proves this otherwise it wouldn't work like it does and would be constantly fighting the magnetic forces. Which is why the sun isn't magnetic in nature either. Can you not feel the radiant force coming from the sun? If it was magnetic in nature, the magnetic force should be equally proportionate to the radiant force. Does the sun mess with your compass? Do we have any technological problems when the sun is up? The slightest magnetic field disables most technology. Even our own technology creates magnetic fields which interferes with it's own operation and why we have to have insulators. We don't see it as much today because we have learned to insulate against it. Older technology was more susceptible to it and never had any problems operating during the day.  A good example would be a magnet against a tube tv/monitor...\n\nLike poles repel and unlike poles attract. North North repels, South North attracts. No matter how you turn it will always point north because the needle itself is south oriented. The opposite end is north oriented and should be attracted to the south the closer you get, but it doesn't. No matter where on Earth you are it will always point to the north. What does that imply to you? Any and all magnetic theory based Earth's are wrong. They constantly show more than 1 pole. Yes I know a magnet has two poles but most show 4. I believe Earth's southern pole is way weaker than the north and why it gets overpowered. I believe the southern pole is weaker because it wraps around the perimeter of the great circle of Earth and the total distance involved versus the north...\n\nAnother fact is how vegetation grows. Where do you think the largest grows? The best tasting ones? In the north, because of the weakening magnetic field. Things in the south taste like shit and has a chemical taste to it. If you go back in history, Norse I believe, they traveled to the north and supposedly the magnetic force was so strong there that it ripped the nails out of their wooden boats and most perished. Very few made it back. I speculate a huge magnetite mountain whether it be underwater, above or both. I also believe that this powerful source generates the aurora borealis...\n\n7th Evidently we like to choose to ignore our own senses. Our atmosphere moves with Earth. Can you not see the atmosphere? Can you not see the various layers moving in all different directions even opposing 1,040 mph spin? The various layers move in such a motion that is not indicative of a spinning object. North to South, East to West, South to North, West to East, North East, North West, South East, South West...\n\nWe won't even mention the rivers either, which are the same...\n\n8th We also obviously like to choose to ignore water, one of the major keys to gaining eyes to see. Water ALWAYS levels to a flat surface naturally. The only time water bends naturally is at it's meniscus which is the surface point in which water contacts a material that repels it. Simple water surface tension proves this. The surface of water is so flat, that by a machinists standard, it has a variance of .001 of an inch. It is so flat, that with the right materials you can forge on water so you have a perfectly flat surface to work with. The Earth is covered in 71% water. Knowing the absolutely undeniable and unarguable facts about water in it's NATURAL rest state, how do you get any type of spheroid from that? Water is magic. It exists in all states and in more states than any other material...\nhttps://water.usgs.gov/edu/waterproperties.html\n\nBet you don't even know how a water level works...\n\nWe won't even go into the diamagnetic properties of water. In a nutshell, if Earth had any type of magnetic field at it's core, water would be pushed away from the Earth.  We already proved the field to be a fallacy in 6...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uENITui5_jU\nAwe, bet \"gravity\" is having a hissy fit!\n\n9th Which brings us to reflections on motionless water.  What does the reflection on water look like? Does it look like a reflection in a concave, convex, or plane mirror?\nhttp://slideplayer.com/slide/5730339/19/images/2/Types+of+Mirrors+There+are+three+basic+types+of+mirrors:+plane,+concave,+and+convex..jpg\nWater at rest ALWAYS reflects like a plane mirror.  No matter how many miles worth of Earth you capture in a photograph, there will NEVER be any spherical refraction on the water...\nhttp://xinature.com/category/lakes/page/2/\nhttps://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/lightandcolor/reflectionintro.html\n\n10th We are spinning at 1,040 mph, orbiting the sun at 67,000 mph, our whole \"system\" is traveling through the \"universe\" at 515,000 mph and all while our \"galaxy\" is traveling at 1.3 million mph. Yet in 5,000 years plus of recorded history the stars position relative to each hasn't changed. The constellations that existed then still exist now. If you dare even say they changed, then please, by all means, tell me how we have navigated the oceans by the stars for thousands of years and arrived at our precise destinations. Tell the seasons by them. Earthquakes can shift millions of tons worth of rock which has no effect on the spinning yet it can cause tsunamis up to 1,720 feet high which still doesn't effect it's spinning. Hell, sound traveling at 768 mph has no problem being heard in a 360 degree angle around you with no distortion in any direction whatsoever. Even a gyro proves no motion to Earth. Show me one thing that exists in reality that maintains a perfect rotating speed. Nothing on Earth is constant, it is always fluctuating. If it happens on a larger scale it should happen on a smaller scale.

Light's own divergent properties prevent it from doing so. Light expands and diminishes quite rapidly. They are not even suns. If all the stars in the \"universe\" were suns there would be no spot in the sky that would be dark period. It is impossible for all the stars to twinkle the same colors from varying distances. They wouldn't all appear white in the sky either. The last light you see before it vanishes is red because it has the longest wavelength. This is the reason the sunsets and sunrises are this color because the sun is moving out of or beginning to come into your viewing distance and farther than the light is capable of traveling. Not because Earth is spinning around it but because the Sun is traversing the Earth...\n\nWe won't even mention that after 12 up the stars disappear, leaving a black void...\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Sun_breaking_through_clouds_over_ocean.jpg\nhttp://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~jkv/images/ictp-conf/sun-light-through-clouds.jpg\n\nFurthermore, the ONLY way you can get these type of angles is from a smaller object casting it's light onto a bigger object.  You CAN NOT get these angles from a bigger object casting it's light onto a smaller object...\n\n12th Crepuscular Rays. Do some simple trigonometry on the ray angles and see what surface length of Earth it must have in order for the sun to be that far away...\nhttp://www.slhuang.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Angels-stairs.jpg\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Angel%27s-stairs.jpg\nI'll even help you:\nA. http://www.visualtrig.com/\nB. In the blue box put 93,000,000. The distance they say the Sun is from Earth.\nC. In the green box put 80.\nFor those that don't understand math. We are taking a plane slice from a 360 degree view. For simplicity, roughly 180 degrees is from the atmosphere to the ground. From any ray that is perpendicular to the ground, that would be center. Any direction from center will contain a 90 degree plane slice. 80 is used to find what a measly 10 degree angle would be. Try 45 degrees and see what you get. The bottom number represents what the surface length Earth must have in order for it to be 93,000,000 miles away. Keep in mind the circumference of Earth is only 24,901...\n\nYou can even try the math on a light source in your home and achieve the same results within proportion...\n\nAnd don't even try to spout some lies about reflection or refraction. The ONLY way this would come into play is if space was water and it isn't the best I can tell so far. It is Aether or Ether, whichever you prefer. An actual physical material. I believe this is the material that may cause some type of a lens effect that compounds the problem. The farther you go up the less material there is anyway so how or what in the hell is it going to bounce or refract off of? The molecules at that height are nowhere near as tightly packed as the molecules at 1,000 feet below sea level...\n\n13th Gravity is a combination of several systems working in tandem. Density, Temperature and Pressure playing the top roles. Gravity is not magnetism and magnetism is not gravity either. Your compass proves this. Otherwise everything would be pulled towards the north pole and not downwards. A simple tornado demonstrates these forces on a daily basis.  They would rather have you believe that some magical force pulls everything to the center of Earth and nothing can escape it. Tell that to the insects. Tell that to water which can move in all axis in motion but levels to a flat motionless surface with none. Tell that to the volcanoes that launch lava high in the sky. Nothing is being pulled down. It is simply falling because it is losing momentum and heavier than the surrounding air...\n\n14th Depending on where you are on Earth the face of the moon changes clock position. The moon is upside down in the southern hemisphere. There can not be any other motion to it period if the face turns in this fashion. A person in the north should see a completely different face than a person in the south. Not a rotated image. A 3D object can not show the same face in different locations when it's spinning or as fools like to say, tidally locked. No matter where on Earth you are you always see the same face, just rotated depending on your location. Just like it's phases are dependent on location. Just like eclipses...\nhttp://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/432737/mod_oucontent/oucontent/15888/2f077e51/b4671af6/moons_1_wk1_fig032.jpg\nhttps://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEatlas/SEatlas3/SE2001-25T-1.GIF\n\nFurther more how can a smaller object's lighter \"gravity\" cancel a bigger object's heavier \"gravity\" and how can we have 2-4 tides daily with 1 rotation of the moon around the Earth? These tides are not consistent over the entire Earth. Various places have different levels, times and lengths of tides...\n\nTides aren't controlled by any source but the waters above and below through various \"gateways\" in our enclosure, by my speculation. If they were controlled by one force then all tides and water levels would be the same but they aren't. They vary depending on location. Just as water can undulated, so can land which means it is not connected to a core but rests upon a denser water. If you really analyze the water patterns, you can begin to see 3-4 sources...\n\n15th Frequencies separate everything from everything else. Until the true nature of \"frequency\" can be determined, we will all continue to fight. When frequencies combine they sometimes result in a completely different frequency than the originating frequencies. Just like colors. Colors aren't truly colors. They are frequencies based off the aspects of light which changes depending on the circumstance. To understand this more you can get several flashlights of varying power and shine them on any colored object and watch how the color changes based on light even though the actual color you perceive doesn't change. Sound, vision, feeling are all based on the specific frequency of an object. Even Earth generates its own frequency separate from all of the elements inside it. Everything is frequency based...\nhttp://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-2/Visible-Light-and-the-Eye-s-Response http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-2/Light-Absorption,-Reflection,-and-Transmission\n\n16th Dinosaurs don't exist.  The bones in the museum are nothing more than plaster with paint.  The real bones are hidden away from public view.  When they gathered enough bones and finally figured out what they had, they had to come up with something.  Giants and dragons and creatures of myths of legends don't fit the evolution model. Plus the brainwashed apes would of started freaking out.  If you believe in evolution and that man evolved from ape to man, go to the zoo, your great great grandparents have been waiting to see you.  While you're at it, please explain why modern technology is etched in stone?  Man was never a neanderthal and didn't evolve from an ape.  Man has been man since the beginning of time, just as he was created...\n\nhttps://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F6%2F65%2FParco_di_pratolino%252C_appennino_del_giambologna_01.JPG&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AParco_di_pratolino%2C_appennino_del_giambologna_01.JPG&docid=gyU-WTYpvKY28M&tbnid=bk8KvAHMadwN4M%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjz17ar5-PWAhWO0YMKHUL8BvYQMwgtKAYwBg..i&w=2200&h=1971&bih=971&biw=1920&q=old%20giant%20statues&ved=0ahUKEwjz17ar5-PWAhWO0YMKHUL8BvYQMwgtKAYwBg&iact=mrc&uact=8\nYou can see obvious signs of bruising and where blood was coming out of major injuries. To me it looks like they died from a massive battle. If they died from a flood, wouldn't you think they would of been in some type of position that suggested they were in water? Plus wouldn't you think if they were submerged in water that the blood wouldn't of formed in this fashion? I am not arguing on the flood because it most certainly happened. The evidence is all around us. Nothing suggests that ocean life was killed, just land life. So if they were underwater why isn't there any type of predator marks either? Wouldn't that suggest that they turned to stone almost instantly? In all myths and legends there is some form of truth, think gorgon...\n\n17th Think of the time before America was even founded.  Had no idea or clue the continent even existed let alone the indigenous life that was already living there.  But low and behold there were Indians, my bad Native Americans.  To each side they were alien in nature.  A life form never before seen.  Human beings are the only intelligent life form to exist.

The problem is that when we go down the temperature variances are not constant.  Another words it appears that there are \"pockets\" of hot spots.

Caused by the pressure of land moving past itself...\n\n\n\nAt one point in time I believe there was a connection to Heaven in the north but it has long since been destroyed because of our last civilizations arrogance which is happening all over again. The evidence of their destruction is all around us, below our feet. I also believe that the reason the stars are the way they are is because they are the Angels who transgressed God which are trapped in their prisons and locked into position for 10,000 years.  Upon release, the wrath of God will ensue and the stars will fall. An enclosed system is just that, nothing gets in and nothings gets out unless willed by God...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbLu9fcQI4w\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNHU5KOI9lQ\n\nIt is said that Heaven is just like Earth.  If this is true, wouldn't that suggest that we are in one of it's oceans?\n\nWhy does everyone want to try to force man's ideology onto creation itself when creation is not bound by the ideas of man...\n\n\n\nI could go on and on but why bother when it will only fall upon deaf and naive ears, so I'll just end with this:\n\nWithin the theoretical realm, one can theorize of time and space. Within that theory, one could hypothesize of time travel, infinite space, other galaxies, alternate dimensions and lots of other rather impressive sounding ideas. Within these hypotheses, one can argue of exotic elements, exotic energies, worm holes, black holes, other planets, other suns and even lots more of rather impressive sounding ideas. But that's all you would be doing. Arguing theoretical bullshit that has absolutely no basis in reality. You can do this all day and every day and get absolutely nowhere when you are arguing made up bullshit...\n\nWithout the human equation, time is meaningless and pointless...\n\nAnything is possible within the constraints of your theoretical existence but not in reality...\n\nAnd to top it all off the most famous equation which holds your theoretical world together is wrong as can be. E=mc¬≤ is a lie and CERN proves this. Einstein's theories are the basis for modern physics.  How many other famous equations are wrong as can be because gullible people believe shit without first proving it to themselves or without holding it to the utmost scrutiny?\n\nAnd just so we are perfectly clear.  Just because science claims something doesn't mean it is how it is.  It is only by their limited understanding and limited capability that they are able to reproduce what we actually see.  Doesn't mean it is how it actually works. If you deny this, then you deny the very fact that in reality things can be done in a multitude of different ways and achieve the exact same result...\n\nBut I'm sure someone will try to lay some pathetic mathematical equations or formulae to try to confuse or point out something that is not.  After all it's the beauty of mathematics.  Math can be 100% right and still point you in the wrong direction.  Without it's labels, whether fact or assumption, math is useless and pointless.  It is a system of delusion.  A system to keep you running in circles so you never find the actual truth...\n\nEverything stated here is based upon facts, unless otherwise stated, which should support the globe but it doesn't.  Hence the dilemma...\n\nIf you choose to attack me, I will respond in the same manner in which I am attacked...\n\nI am not here to teach you, that's your job, only say that which will open your eyes...\n\nWhen will your eyes open and see the world as it truly is?  When will you realize that Satan is using God's word and the technology you are forced to create through your slave jobs against you?\n\nBelieve what you want, it is the choice God gave to you.

It's weak so we only see it on giant masses like a planet. The water  filling that container is just being pulled towards the earth (downwards). Water and any liquid is going to take the shape the forces acting on it cause it to take. The forces on water in a container would be gravity pulling it down, and reaction force from the container holding the water in the container hence why it takes the shape of the container. How does gravity only hold oceans but not bugs? Gravity affects bigger masses more that smaller masses therefore bugs have a reduced force pulling them down compared to a giant ocean. Plus, bugs have wings to counteract gravity whereas oceans have nothing to propel themselves off of the planet.\n\nOn the topic of planes: if you jumped in a moving bus/train, are you suddenly hit the back? No, because your body is moving at the same speed as the vehicle. That's how planes work. That's how the planet moves so fast without killing us. It's not speed that matters but rather a change in speed that affects us. Everything on the Earth is moving with the Earth which is why planes actually need to move forward in the air on a globe.\n\nThe reason people believe in the globe earth is because it explains everything. We've predicted eclipses and events whereas I can't even find a flat earth model that explains lunar eclipses/blood moons and arctic day night cycles. This is all ignoring how there's no reason to lie, the absence of any other flat masses in space, the necessities to convince thousands of people to lie, the money spent on space technology globally, the lack of an actual to scale flat earth model that actually works with what has been observed as well as so many issues.\n\nThe globe explains everything.

This explains the atmospheric composition of the planets; Jupiter, with its high gravity, holds onto the lighter, zippier gasses like hydrogen and helium, whereas Earth can only hold onto the more sluggish, heavier gasses like oxygen and nitrogen. One interesting and downright scary consequence of this is that, because water is dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen by sunlight and that hydrogen escapes the Earth, and because the Sun is gradually getting hotter water is actually slowly leaking away into space at such a rate that in 800 million years most of it'll be gone and Earth will be a lifeless desert planet. This is a shockingly short time geologically speaking and another great reason to get the hell off this rock. I refuse to respond to people like Guybrush Threepwood for many of'em are just trolls, and the True Believers are unreachable because Flearthism really is a form of religion and as such its adherents will just keep reciting the dogma their fake prophets like Jeranism, who well and truly know the Earth's spherical but keep up the pretense for personal gain, have taught them, without ever exploring the very easy answers to their dogmatic questions which are handed to them on a silver platter by the sadly misguided people who actually think they might have a tiny chance of getting through to a Flearther. Young Earth Creationists, who are another very similar and often overlapping group, also have their dogmatic 'questions' they think of as deep and difficult to answer, and I love it when they try to use science because that puts them well and truly on my turf, where I patiently school them without being condescending. I've gotten over my anger with the religious and these days I'm more interested in the psychology of how and why people believe crazy things, and I've found that by treating them well I've actually had some success in opening their minds a tiny bit. Many a Jehova, Mormon and YEC have left an hour later with their heads spinning and questioning some of their convictions. Unfortunately, YouTube's comments section, like most 'social' media, is expressly designed to foster division and hate; their entire platforms encourage the creation of crazy conflicting ideas in order to waste people's time, energy and effort, preventing them from uniting and focusing their combined power on dismantling the system of control that allows the very few who own the power to take it from the many that make it to produce the greatest inequality in history. That's the real 'conspiracy', and it's truly ironic that Flearthers can't see it, and very sad that those who make video responses also don't, and also don't realize that by making response videos they're actually maintaining a cycle without which Flearthism would wither into inconsequentiality. For an exploration of true madness you can't go wrong with the Flearthers who also go on about aliens, because there are two main groups who both believe the other to be crazy and/or agents of satan/aliens/the deep state; one believes aliens are running the show and the other believes that the aliens are actually faked by the FBI/CIA/etc. The stuff they come up with is just amazing, and their hatred for each other leads to spectacular flamewars that make the Basic Flearther/Normal People rows seem almost loving in comparison.  Unlike these boring Flearthers who just recite the same tired old nonsense, these groups have amazingly detailed and fascinating descriptions of exactly why and how this Global Conspiracy actually works. For True Connoisseurs of Craziness they can't be beat, just search for \"Flat Earth Aliens\" and hold on to your seat!", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "MadScientist512", "channel": "UC5wchDFyqzaSogpxY-YAsAw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBOowhHlQYYiSQpl3sNw5ez-OO_4UtdvBDTQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Using nebulous definitions when trying to formulate one's wordview isn't helpful if one needs to argue one's position or wishes to employ coherent logic and have commensurately well-reasoned beliefs. It's important that we not confuse arguments with sloppy definitions just because an idea is a compelling one, or just because a certain definition is used colloquially. We don't have other universes we can measure to compare this one to, or the necessary features of a deity, so we can't tell the probability of one existing, so the null position is more logical than that of believing in an unfalsifiable hypothesis with 0 explanatory power. The courtroom analogy and the necessary logical and practical distinction between Guilt, Non-Guilt, and Innocence is a useful one. In my disbelief I find god Not Guilty of existing. For clarity‚Äôs sake, Guilt and Non-Guilt in this analogy corresponds with Belief and Non-Belief, respectively, and Innocence with knowledge, or more specifically agnostic (if a courtroom were set up in reverse where Guilt was the default then it would equate to gnostic). God is innocent of existing until proven guilty. As such, agnosticism is the default position, and the only logical, or reasonable, verdict is atheist. You can't just declare a mistrial every time there's insufficient evidence of guilt. In my disbelief I find god Not Guilty of existing.

Somehow you have interpreted something very sinister from this exchange. Shows where your distorted mind is. She could have been crying for numerous different reasons. Tears of joy, love, disappointment, pain, pleasure. The inference from Richard Ayoade's joke is that she was crying in disappointment or displeasure. It is very unlikely a man could be accused or successfully prosecuted with rape on his wedding night unless he was physically violent and coercive such as using a weapon.  If a woman is a virgin on her wedding night it is expected that during intercourse there will be some discomfort. it may be painful enough to induce tears in the woman and it may not be a pleasant experience. Rather than being an inappropriate joke trivializing unpleasant sexual intercourse from a moral point or forced intercourse constituting rape, it was a big dig at Donald Trump's apparent lack of sexual appeal and inadequacy as a compassionate lover.
