{"cid": "UgxF3t-pUiHoyrU1w-h4AaABAg", "text": "CO2 at 0.04% is a 2,500th of the atmosphere. That means to warm the climate by just 1\"C carbon dioxide molecules must capture 2500\"C of heat energy. That is bonkers. It also breaks all the laws of thermodynamics.¬†\n\nMethane is 0.00017% of the atmosphere so its even more bonkers.\n\nHowever, the climate is changing. This is because of deliberate geoengineering programmes, in particular ozone thinning away from the poles. Though largely unreported ozone thinning effect is directly observable, this summer you will see a unnaturally bright sun just as we did last year. Under these conditions the pain felt when looking at the sun is not only from the increase in visible light but the much larger increase in infrared.¬†(Look up at the sky and you will see a range of geoengineering operations in progress, these include chemtrail induced cloud or hazing, ripple patterns caused by HAARP installations, bizarre and unnatural cloud formations). \n\nClimate change is a programme to force change in accordance with the implementation of Agenda 21 /2030. Current events demonstrate this transition is well underway and will involve massive population cull through injected nanotech (re transhumanist programme). Agenda 21 also sees the permanent loss of all property rights with the introduction of universal basic income (ref NESARA/GESARA) and has/is being promoted by The World Economic Forum.¬†\n\n'You will own nothing and you will be happy' WEF\n\nIn a depopulated world the surviving brainwashed and controlled population will be confined to mega cities. Carbon limits will be used to restrict consumption and liberty. Meanwhile the re-greened wilderness will be the exclusive playground of the ultra rich elite posing as conservationists.¬†\n\nThe CO2 hoax amounts to the theft of the world and the enslavement of humanity by a parasitic few.¬†\n\nWelcome to the future!\n\n_______\n\nI have included a debunking of 'accumulated heat' as it is so often used to explain how trace elements, so called 'greenhouse gasses', can warm the planet. \n\nAccumulated heat whilst sounding a reasonable explanation of how heat can build up is rather nothing more than gobbledygook. In fact it shows those using such arguments do not even understand what heat is. \n\nWhen we measure temperature we are measuring the heat energy a thing is losing. In short heat is a measurement of flow, the transfer of heat energy and this will always be in the direction towards the colder. For this reason a thing can never 'accumulate heat' in the way those advocating CO2 climate change describe. The temperature of a body is the measure of heat output, it can never be greater than the measure of heat input. Output = input. When a thing is warmed it is heated to an equivalent of the heat input. If this input is not maintained it will cool. Those that propose that heat can build up to be hotter than the total measure of heat input at a given time either do not understand what heat is or are being deliberately misleading. To illustrate, an object being heated by a flame can never become hotter than that flame, it's temperature cannot rise inexorably to the temperature of the sun for instance. Heat cannot be accumulated. When we think about it common sense tells us this must be the case. \n\nNASA and even Nobel Prize winning physicists have expounded 'accumulated heat' as the explanation how CO2 is able to warm the atmosphere. They claim that over hundreds of years CO2 has captured heat energy and this heat has 'accumulated' to produce a serious warming effect. As I have just explained, this is totally impossible and fundamentally violates all the laws of thermodynamics. That respected scientists should support such uneducated, unthinking nonsense is disturbing and only reflects that in terms of being able to think clearly about a subject they have no facility or inclination. These are the Dark Ages of science. Belief has outweighed logic or any critical thought. It tells us that we should not unquestioningly accept anything we are told, that experts can be fools. \n\n(NB: be aware of attempts to discard thermodynamics by talking about biology. \nEg. 'It only takes a drop of arsenic to kill a person.'\nThis would be somewhat desperate, muddled thinking. Clearly biological processes based on the reaction of a cell are not the same as the laws of physics/thermodynamics).", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Doobidoo", "channel": "UCyC0Af0-EE9uid0PaZRR0iQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQAZt03SaZXwqDp6Xho5pVQD_62KeEITfeI=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Big companies need the most resources and make up the biggest polluters, so local and smaller is better.\n\n4) universal basic income so people dont have \"to make a living\" at any cost and follow their passions- no damaging, stupid or unnecessary work\n\n5) make hemp biodiesel (and other biodiesels) make up 30% of all fuel compulsory in the economy and make investments. Tackle food waste and make it maximal 5% of all produced. Go towards 0% fossil fuels with improved technology. Swap most plastics for hemp-derived materials\n\n6) sustainability index- make an index of the worst environmental offender-practices. Ban those that are not needed and bring within limits those that can be made sustainable. Use taxes to incentivize/disincentivize\n\n7) go towards a bio-adapted infrastructure such as passages for the wild under highways and so forth. Go back to natural farming, drop all intensive farming, is healthier anyway. Decrease production of animal products. Abandon chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides, all not sustainable.¬†\n\n8) we need a working UN back in some form, to protect areas such as the amazonas and other strategically important parts of the world for the ecology. Besides that we need first nation countries to invest in countries that are lagging behind, as the investment would yield much greater results.

The scale of the internet scientific collaboration and debate before we can even address this problem would in itself be a mountain to climb. Because many questions are being asked all in one video. Therefore many collaborations and solutions are required. Firstly, the loss of land in the areas required to grow food and provide cheap labour. Obviously the displacement is not a second concern, but a contributed one. Land cannot be replaced on such a large scale with only one solution. The use of rubbish to aid with the subsistence is only a stop gap fantasy at worst, a massive scientific collaboration at best. The conversion of this sinking land to rice fields would also be a major cost problem, as would the moving of a major city. But not impossible to imagine. Similarly the land erosion problem. I dont want to destroy the loss of precious dinosaur bones theory, as it will undoubtedly draw more scientific minds to the overall problem. Also the mass mining of methane idea is not only going to be a fantasy on such a scale, its in inprobable. The use of vegetation and/or fungi to solve or aid this problem will also only be a small piece to a giant puzzle. Stopping such a gigantic soil erosion would be a collaborative engineering achievement in itself to rival the pyramids.

The arctic, antarctic, Sahara and wastelands of South America would be habitable. It would double lands we could live on. \nShort term things would get bad. Like a little natural population control isn't already needed? Long term f-ing great for all.\nMore Co2 = more plants. More plants absorb more heat. More heat = more H2O evaporation. The atmosphere has an H2O saturation point. At that point H2O stops being a \"greenhouse gas\" and precipitates out, it rains. More rain = less deserts and bonus round more plants and better global temperature balance. Winner winner chikin dinner. \nStop listing to this \"MAN MADE GLOBAL DESTRUCTION\" BS.

A real environmentalists nightmare. I went Vegan 17 years ago hoping to feel better about what was happening to the world and the environment. I never thought it would ever start to catch on in a big way. To my surprise it has started to take off a little but just the other day i realised how sad the situation really is. Oil is becoming too difficult and too expensive to extract and the energy giants are already well into the switchover to biofuels. It's happening slowly and seemingly silently right in front of our faces but we won;t really realise how destructive it will become for many more decades. And how sad is it that half of the people turning vegan are doing it hoping to help the restoration of nature. But the sick reality is that by becoming vegan we are actually facilitating the freeing up of land to allow the production of biofuel by way of intensive mono-culture farming.\n  The sad thing is that we will need more fuel than ever before over the next 40 years. As the world population stabilises the developing world will also become the new No. 1 consumer by far, since they represent a much larger percentage of the worlds population than the western world does.\n  I knew it was too good to be true when i saw everyone starting to go vegan. The only hope we really have to restore nature is to drop the capitalistic system and take a step back into community and family life. It will take huge sacrifices but the consequences will eventually be horrific", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "izzzzzz6", "channel": "UCDfC5jXiaoA41DMo4I3k06Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQkzPDzV0HtNBT2pPrRip_RQTwm7mJ8iL1ksEVM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Now the cause for all the weather problems, our Earth is being in three different directions. Our 2nd Sun is pulling one way, our Moon is pulling in an other, then our old sun is pulling against Earth. This is why we have sink holes, Earthquakes, Floods, Snowing in Arabia, Pole Shift, Volcanos, Fires every where and this is only the beginning.

Both heats and colds are become much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep. They do not often lie, below the mountains, more than one, two, or three days, and very rarely a week. They are remembered to have been formerly frequent, deep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform me the earth used to be covered with snow about three months in every year. The rivers, which then seldom failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scarcely ever do so now. This change has produced an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold, in the spring of the year, which is very fatal to fruits. From the year 1741 to 1769, an interval of twenty-eight years, there was no instance of fruit killed by the frost in the neighbourhood of Monticello. An intense cold, produced by constant snows, kept the buds locked up till the sun could obtain, in the spring of the year, so fixed an ascendency as to dissolve those snows, and protect the buds, during their developement, from every danger of returning cold. The accumulated snows of the winter remaining to be dissolved all together in the spring, produced those overflowings of our rivers, so frequent then, and so rare now.\"\n\n¬† In 1816 winters had become so cold¬† snow never melted one summer, and remained harsh and cold until 1850,¬† when warming began.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "bluskies1000", "channel": "UC3HnsD86p52d8dsti47G04w", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQhUI2IUTwatDEZIImlohfQykpIkpHwy_efuQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz4PrD1GMJdUiktcih4AaABAg", "text": "Climate change is the current pretext to justify halting use of the land resource. Building upwards and ceasing expansion outwards causes home prices to skyrocket and places the lifetime earnings of citizens extracted through rent squarely into the hands of the International Socialists. Within a generation a nation is turned into a vassal. \n\nA similar campaign half a century ago employing agricultural land as the pretext caused home prices to launch from the ten thousand dollar to the million dollar level pricing homes beyond reach while simultaneously making million dollar an acre land unfeasible to farm.\n\nOrganized protest, including pleas from children, attends each attempted use of land.\n\nEach time another tract of land is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù the public cheers. Those most affected tighten the snare on their own demise. Thousands of homeless in each city. \n\nAll of the land on this planet was promised to the chosen few, together with the increase that it yields. It is being redeemed.\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\nPreserving farmland inspired a movement to protect all land from development instead of making forestland that we have in extravagant abundance available for housing. This restriction caused farmland values to skyrocket making it uneconomical to till. Homes that were $10,000 to $60,000 with the average price ranging from $10,000 in most cities to $24,000 in the more expensive regions rose to multi-millions as a result of the artificially created shortage. A mile width of forestland over a short distance near cities would eliminate the housing issue permanently. We have thousands of miles of forest. Saving a forest is ill-conceived. Nature ignores man‚Äôs declarations and continues on its usual course of cleansing by fire the forest of its dead, dying and diseased to make way for new growth, as it has been doing since time immemorial. \n\nA generation prevented from acquiring a home and becoming established lives for experience that soon devolves to escape by taking drugs.\n\nCitizens whose income enabled them to purchase a ten thousand dollar home with a value that now exceeds a million dollars are doomed. Their home must be sold to cover deferred property taxes and to repay loans secured by equity upon winding-up of their estate. The freedom that derives from owning your own home is ending.\n\nCivic governments reap a bonanza from property assessments generating billion dollar surpluses. This is ‚Äúinvested‚Äù in the equivalent of municipals that return $3 in forty years time for each $100 spent on acquiring them now. Young people work two shifts daily in order to keep a roof over their heads, one that they will never own. A third of the world away a hill of sand is transformed into a metropolis. \n\nCitizens have been conditioned to view with anathema and as evil National Socialism in which the resources of a nation and economic output of its population benefits their own country.\n\nAn enduring legacy of Communism as well as its ulterior motive is the departure of residents from family dwellings into highrises enabling International Socialists to capture their lifetime earnings through rent and for all time to subjugate these nations. Democratic nations enact regulations that are a bottomless pit in order to frustrate and end the construction and private ownership of homes.\n\nEconomic distortion arising from this deliberately created artificial shortage with all earnings going towards rent that enriches the chosen few acts like a cancerous tumor destroying its host.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "the Unrepentant", "channel": "UChs3Bej3QXicdThw5poQ23g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJ74K-mdnMtayccBimfvotKR-xZIixSM8WtA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see page 3 of the 2013 Summary Report), averaged over all land and ocean surfaces, over the 132 years between 1880 and 2012, earth temperature has warmed 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit (0.85 degrees Celsius). This rate of temperature change is within the normal range of historic temperature changes which naturally occurred before humans started burning fossil fuel, so the man-made global warming theory fails at the first stage of evidence.\n\r\nGlobal Warmists have failed to show any causal correlation between historic or current atmospheric CO2 concentrations and Earth Temperature.  Earth's atmosphere has 0.04% CO2 and there is no evidence that CO2 is a so-called \"greenhouse gas\", that's why you can't show an correlation between current or historic atmospheric CO2 concentrations and earth temperature.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations are presently 0.04% which is only one hundredth of the concentration at which CO2 starts to become harmful to humans.  CO2 is not pollution, CO2 essential for verdant abundance of planet Earth. We need more CO2 in the atmosphere.

How many times have scientists ever measured a one hundred year period over the millions of years? Never perhaps? Co2 emissions have been rising exponentially since the 1800's. Temps have barely moved. Sea levels have been rising linear for at least 200 years at only about 3mm per year. Why no correlation with Co2? \n\nFor 10,000 years glaciers have been melting. As they melt, the earth becomes less reflective. This causes temps to rise and speed up. Glaciers begin to melt faster. Melt, speed up, melt more, speed up more. This gives you a rising curve in the temp graph. \n\nOn top of that 7.5 billion people exhale Co2 every second instead of only 1 billion people back in the 1800's. That's 7.5 times more Co2 just from human breathing. We are also paving the entire planet and cutting down every Co2 sucking jungle and forest on the planet. Way less Co2 being extracted. \n\nCities are far warmer and heat absorbent.  I live in Toronto. We sit by Lake Ontario. On any given summer day it is 5 degrees cooler by the lake than in the heart of the city. How many cities existed 200 years ago? Satellites now measure temps almost every sq foot of the ground.

If the carbon dioxide concentration continued to rise it would not get hotter it would only get greener and wetter. Commercial greenhouses where the carbon dioxide concentration is deliberately doubled are no hotter than a greenhouse where the air is the same as outside, but the one with more CO2 uses more water, because the plants grow 50% bigger. The temperature increases that are predicted by carbon-tax (climate-tax) collectors do not match real-world measurements. Basically it's nothing to do with the climate. These people are communists. Look at North Korea, where the people are forced to devote most of their precious time to pretending that Kim fatty the 3rd is some sort of deity, and then look at the \"climate change\" agenda where people are forced to pretend that paying carbon tax is going to make the things that drive the climate more forgiving. Guess what drives the climate:\nThe Sun. You pay carbon tax to worship the Sun.\nThe Earth's orbit around the Sun. You pay carbon tax to worship the Earth.\nThe Earth's Oceans and volcanic activity. You pay carbon tax to worship the elements, water, and fire.\nBut what about the other elements? What about the wood element? \nWood grows from water. OK, got that covered.\nWhat about the air?

The hard core leftists and environmental zealots are drowning out the scientists. They also demonstrate considerable hypocrisy. Do you have any idea of the environmental impact of a climate summit? No scientist is claiming this to be apocalyptic. Any message, whether accurate or inaccurate, that is spread with such reinforcing fear simply becomes the truth. When you repeat something often enough it becomes the truth. \n\nDo you realize that the latest media frenzy regarding the recent statement from a so called group of 11,000 scientists has already been proven to be fake. A blogger invented the name - The Alliance of Scientists - the claims have not risen from a research paper, it was nothing more than an opinion piece. It was put up on this Alliance web site, and if you agreed with the statements you were invited to click on a link that signed your name to the document. It was no better than \"liking\" something on someone's Facebook page. A study of the names and occupations revealed that these were just ordinary people not scientists. They were accountants, Lawyers, administrators, analysts. Most were activists and artists. They have even discovered fake entries like Micky Mouse, and other such nonsense. But the media ran with it and reinforced into everybody's heads about this climate emergency. People are not hearing differing perspectives because dissent of any kind is demonised. This is an authoritarian tactic. \n\nIn the 1970's real actual scientists were predicting an ice age, based on a serious drop in the temp graph from the 1930's onward. There were numerous books out about the impending planetary starvation. One of these books, no doubt in today's bargain bins, was written by the co-founder of extinction rebellion. Geologists claimed we were running out of oil. Humans have met a myriad of challenges. We are innovative and creative. Fear mongering solves nothing.

The federal control agency NTIA and FCC in the US along with numerous other regulatory agencies around the world have a group of scientists who advise them on 'undue risk' to the public - it's a frequency spectrum balancing act - if the benefits outweigh the strategic risk then they generally give the go ahead with certain restrictions. \n\nThe military for example have use of some very dangerous technology - in the microwave spectrum - that is known to be harmful to us human beings at certain ranges. In other words many governmental  organization's knowingly make use of technology that is harmful to the environment and living organisms including us because the strategic benefits outweigh the risk. Radiation poisoning  is a gradual process especially if the organism is large enough not to notice the effects in the short term.\n\nConsider how deadly these technologies are to all less resilient life forms - including plants, birds, insects etc. \n\nWe have been ramping up wireless technology usage exponentially since the computer age with little global regulation and long term global due diligence. \n\nAccording to the numerous studies on insect biomass the exponential decline started approximately 3 decades ago - but warning bells only started sounding in the last 15 years! Its the same with bird population decline and plants etc. It's very difficult to coordinate multi species global research - how can you be sure the researchers are all unbiased for example. Wireless technology is a major contributing factor but not the only cause of this catastrophe. \n\nIsolating cause and effect is very difficult. \n\nThere needs to be a global authority that immediately  addresses / restricts and outlaws the usage of most of the frequency spectrum currently in use in both civilian and military applications. \n\nThat's not a simple task!

I think Singapore provides a great model for how we can accomodate both growth and the movement of people. The change in climate isn't the end of the world. But it does ask us to design for the future. We will need to consider energy and natural habitat along with people. Up to 2 billion people will likely relocate over the next 30 years. I like Singapore because the design accomodates what is needed. There are already projections of where populations will be moving. This provides the world a opportunity to design, integrate & educate large numbers of people who have lagged behind in the development process.  If we Do This Right it's possible climate change will bring opportunity and better way of life to people who were largely disenfranchised before. I have a list of dreams for the future. Clean renewable energy, distribution, storage, vertical agriculture as we see in Singapore. Plus using vertical agriculture to help us regain habitat space.

{"cid": "UgzAKAJ-doTVlhqr3HJ4AaABAg", "text": "Storms, floods, and earthquakes are indeed a part of the present world. We sometimes call them ‚Äúnatural disasters,‚Äù but they are not a surprise to God. Yes, God certainly can control the weather and send deadly storms.\r\nSome have concluded that suffering occurs because it is beyond God‚Äôs control. This is incorrect. God has indeed established certain laws and principles that govern nature, but he remains sovereign over these laws. Psalm 148:8 declares that storms ‚Äúdo his bidding.‚Äù Concerning Jonah, it was the Lord who ‚Äúsent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea‚Äù (Jonah 1:4 KJV).\r\nOld Testament writers did not hesitate to attribute the forces of nature to God: ‚Äúthy waterspouts ‚Ä¶ thy waves ‚Ä¶ thy billows‚Äù (Psalm 42:7 KJV). Today, God‚Äôs creation is too often depersonalized. He is in control, and has His reasons for all kinds of weather, both fair and stormy. \r\nJob‚Äôs family killed by a severe storm\r\nOne biblical example is the story of Job. Severe weather had killed Job‚Äôs sheep, his servants, and all 10 of his children.\r\nAs Job suffered further physical affliction, he asked, ‚ÄúWhy is there evil in the world?‚Äù His friends were not of great help in answering the question.\r\nFinally, after much dialog, God spoke directly to Job out of a whirlwind (Job 38-41). The Lord made clear that His control over nature and His ultimate purposes are to be trusted. We simply cannot understand all the details of the Divine plan.\nhttps://christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-c023.html", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Past or Present", "channel": "UC4w55msDGyUkpObiqDZZwIw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJzQar40F7EBv5jlasJuLK3sPioZ1uvJiBzz_6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nothing that's been proposed by the IPCC has any hope of changing the outcome predicted in this documentary, even based on the IPCC's own reports.  We need to de-fund the IPCC and reallocate the $ and brainpower to the rapid commercialization of Molten Salt Thorium Reactors (MSTRs).  They are extremely safe and produce very little nuclear waste.  The waste they do produce has a short half life, so it can be safely and economically stored.  MSTRs don't produce CO2, don't produce usable amounts of weapons grade fissile material,  and once commercialized they should produce electricity at lower costs than any technology other than hydro-electric.  If you factor in the huge, hidden cost in $ and net CO2, of millions of acres of trees lost to reservoirs, MSTRs are even more economically and environmentally cost effective than hydro, and the capital cost should be much lower once they are commercialized.  \n\nCommercial MSTRs will be modular so they can be produced in on a production line basis, to lower capital cost and increase supply.  They can be operated safely on smaller scales than most other energy generation systems, so theycan be more distributed, reducing the cost of transmission infrastructure, and allowing generation even in remote locations.   They do not require large amounts of water for cooling.  MSTRs are inherently more thermodynamically efficient than most other fuel-based, electrical generation technologies, and waste heat from the reactor can be used to desalinate/purify water.   Even the most conservative estimates of readily available thorium put the supply at 10s of thousands of years based on increasing consumption to allow everyone on earth to use the same energy per capita as the US.  Accessing less readily available reserves produce estimates of a million years plus.\n\nWith lots of power to move earth, making concrete, and pumping water become easier AND will have little to no environmental impact.  Do your own research.  Understand the advantages of MSTRs, and, based on that research, you agree that MSTR's are the best hope for the future, do your part and push for the rapid governmental approval and commercialization of the technology.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Work Works", "channel": "UC5rKgHcvTAVvYkgInLkPvKg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT27am92K30U4vWsIxSm3Pdsbwq-qH15p_hNbjGjw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I have lived in many places across the globe and in none of these places has the climate changed over the past century.\n\nP.S. the Earth does not a \"a climate\"  it has millions of them.    The Sahara is still a desert, the Amazon Basin is still a tropical rain forest, The Yukon is still an arctic tundra, and the Midwest USA is still the huge temperate breadbasket of the world;   So rich in food production it can afford to waste more than 25% of it on another enviro-disaster, ethanol laced fuel.\n\nFor extra credit tell us when the \"Earth's climate\" was ideal.   In which century or millennia did it occur?      If you cannot give us any goal,  just how are we supposed to re-vector the vast forces of nature towards its ideal target?\n\nIf you cannot do this, then forgiven me for coming to the unavoidable conclusion that you  are just another chattering chimp for socialist slavery.", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Bruce Frykman", "channel": "UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT9nAHoHszJVuJ9cqwbvZ3EBY6SW9eGgk2i8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Just about everyone agrees with that on both sides of the argument. It shows the recovery from the Little Ice Age which spanned the Maunder and Dalton Grand Solar minimums. Some of the graphs today no longer show the warm period in the 1930's and NASA has been called out on this. The temperatures were adjusted downward. Anyway here we have a global warming trend which started way before the massive industrialization and way before the rise in CO2. I take exception to your comment that it is warmer now than a thousand years ago which was the medieval warming period and the 10,000 year ago claim that it has warmed since. 10,000 years ago is the beginning of the Holocene Optima which was a couple degrees warmer today. Ever since the Optima the temperature would decrease and increase several times until the present but each time it doesn't get quite as warm. Comparing this inter glacial period to the three previous you will also see each one is progressively cooler. Solar activity is showing that we are now in the Eddy Grand Solar Minimum and it will last for the next 30 years or longer. The danger is crop failure and we are already seeing that happen now.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Roy Oetting", "channel": "UCi1JJC-IByge-eLQQMg7vhw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQDjO6rYSLKRe26YIzq5crbY9qsz3RExLpDpOVL=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Hard to find people willing to have this discussion nowadays without things devolving into mud slinging...\n\nSorry for the lengthy reply but bear with me and read all of it. Hopefully it makes sense by the end (Based on your comment I'm replying to I think it will) :-) \n\nMan made climate change isn't about hot cold hot cold. I mean it sort of is, but man made climate change is more about ocean level rise over the next 10,000 years or so, and what we can do to help prevent it. \n\nWe are DESTINED to be in another ice age in the next 10-15,000 years or so (estimates on when that is still vary to some small degree)... Mankind will NEVER be able to stop that from happening. In other words NO amount of CO2 in the atmosphere seems likely to stop this from happening. \n\nBUT! CO2 levels WHILE we are in the interglacial period we are currently in CAN affect how high the ocean levels get between now and the next ice age. \n\nToday, more than half of the world's population lives on or within a hundred miles of the coastlines. Trillions of dollars of prime real estate will be sunk in the next few hundred to thousand years if we don't learn to try to curb our CO2 emissions. \n\nOne thing is absolutely certain. IF we continue on the path we're on, sea levels WILL rise ~60 feet between now and the next ice age. Why 60 feet? Because we've calculated exactly how much ice there is on the earth today, and if it were to completely melt, over whatever time period you want to imagine, we can calculate exactly how high the ocean levels will go. \n\nAt this point, with the amount of CO2 we've generated to date, SOME level of rise will take place (estimates and timelines involved vary, that's why we're trying to perfect the models) \n\nIf we can learn to curb our CO2 emissions, or move completely off fossil fuels over to nuclear as a primary source of energy, MAYBE we can limit that rise to 5-10 feet, 20 feet, who knows... \n\nWouldn't you like to try to, at the very least TRY to keep that from happening?", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Les Schorlemer", "channel": "UCfgnvY8bNlFUN2sXvhNehyg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgSz-br7sqlhhUWY9Tf2IS25LgInkou8a86g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
