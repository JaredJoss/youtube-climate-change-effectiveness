{"cid": "UgzKRHRDF8LWDXOsH6B4AaABAg", "text": "So, I reject the notion that human activity is a primary factor in climate change. I see far more impact on our climate from natural phenomena, including solar activity and cycles in the earth's elliptical orbit around the sun. Also, the climate has been changing well before there was an significant human industrial activity in the 19th century. In fact, there were periods in history during which the climate was warmer and also cooler than the present day.\n\nNow, that said, I do agree that humans have a negative impact on our environment. We pollute the air, land, and sea that we all depend on. This is not good and we should certainly be better stewards of the one planet we have to live on.\nBut, as David Saddington suggests, this is not achieved by continually repeating the same old story about the climate. Firstly, that numbs people into inaction. Secondly, proclaiming a false message of man-made climate change does even more to push away those who object to the notion.\n\nIf you want more people to take action, then try focusing on the reality of human pollution and focus on that which is relevant to them. The biggest issue I have when I hear people crying about man-made climate change is that it's often in the context of pushing more government restrictions on businesses and economic growth. And, it's often coming from people espousing more left-wing ideals. So, it's pretty easy to tune that out and completely ignore anything they're crying about.\nYet, taking care of the environment isn't a political idea. It means being a good steward of our planet. Politics should be irrelevant.\n\nAnyway, eventually, we'll be switching over to more renewable energy sources, regardless of man-made climate change activists. As nonrenewable energy sources become more scarce, they become more expensive. And, the technology for more renewable sources will advance and help make them cheaper.\nAn excellent source is nuclear energy. But, the same activists who often cry about man-made climate change also seem to be against the best solution to eliminate a great deal of CO2 emissions; interesting.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "John C", "channel": "UC_oINp5s8fWuw27jCSyNQeQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRH50m8ub7tIrRjcEJXJdBuD3JfHf-HCdX-NGb8OA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You could stop EVERY last bit of carbon from being emitted on earth and our climate will STILL CHANGE. THIS IS WHAT CLIMATE DOES!! Besides, if you remove too much carbon from the earth, plant life will definitely suffer.( Why do you think prehistoric plants grew to such enormous sizes with all the excess carbon dioxide in the air and MUCH warmer temperatures than today?)I'm tired of being lectured at over something that will never stop changing. If you want to improve things on this planet why not instead go after something that we CAN control that would have a far greater impact on our future? Namely pollution and overpopulation. You can pick any kind of pollution as there's certainly no end to it. Air, earth or water, take your pick. Millions of people die every year from pollution but it doesn't have the same emotional charge as climate change does and that is a real travesty. \nIf you really want to improve the lives of those in third world countries, stop railing against the privileged west for their suffering. Instead, how about some education about the terrible effects of having far, far too many children that can neither be provided for nor can the region support with very FINITE amounts of both food and water. Why it even needs to be taught is beyond me. Why do mothers in impoverished regions think it is okay to have 6,7,8 or more children knowing full well that they have not enough resources to provide for 1 or 2? Surely a well-managed population/to resource allocation would have far greater effects on the local standard of living than how many cars are driven in the west.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "S.

{"cid": "Ugxfij35H7KVA0HyiSV4AaABAg", "text": "why don't people like you care about climate change.  it is simple,  because this policy of endless growth which is destroying our climate will not reach its full maturity in your lifetime so why should you care.    that applies to everyone else that doesn't believe it.\n\n\nIs climate change real or false? forget all the scientists and there graphs and figures, just deal with basic physics.\n\nThe answer lies in two simple laws of physics.\n\nPhysic law one, This is the one you practice every single day of your life,  that shows and tells you that you cannot have endless growth in a space that is not endless.   There is no need to listen to people for the answer to this question is in your everyday life  that tells you the truth., so why are you ignoring what you practice every day? because you cannot face the truth that's why.\n\nIt is physically impossible to endlessly put something into something that is not endless.   Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it.\n\nIf that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support.\n\nBut that is not what the human species wants to do,  it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with  population control,  it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. \n\n Physics law two)\n\nIt is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving.  No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind.\nNow you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck.\n That's what happening we are coming unstuck but we are living in denial.\n\nThis should tell you,  it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing.\n\n The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer.\n\nThe answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. \n\n So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support,  then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. \n\nThese two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it's not going to be a good one especially for the future generations.... ie:  your children.\n\nIf anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong,  get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong.\n you can try it with any limited space and I guarantee you will fail.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe Wood", "channel": "UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS63NstucXB0MVoeIK6xdTFv10Y25HdWiVl8hqH6A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Data suggests that catastrophic weather is in decline, temperatures are within normal range, the sea levels arent rising any faster or slower than they have been for hundreds of years, crops are doing better than ever, the ice caps are still there.\n\nDon't be fooled. We are putting millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and eventually, if we continue our use of carbon based energy, we will have a problem one day, but that day is not today, not tomorrow, not for another couple hundreds of years.\n\nEarth, within the last 450 million years, has gone through many many changes. There are Ice Ages on record with CO2 levels 10 times higher than today. And pre-industrial CO2 levels were at an incredible 180 ppm. Today its 400. Temperature change patterns wildly around 40 degrees Celsius. Pre-industrial suggests it was 22 degrees Celsius. Today its 23.\n\nSo, I don't think climate change science has bad intentions. I think the intentions are good. But the science is bad. I think the science is what has struck so many people down with fear, and to this day fails to accept that it has incorrectly predicted the weather patterns of the future. Today, none of which that was predicted has come to pass. But we always see new studies, new thesis, new hypothesis, predictions, models, data, suggestions: the science has a bleak outlook on the future.

I get the point that science topic can be hard to access by everyone. But isn't this also the point?  It is complex stuff. \n\n\nAt some point there was eugenics in the academic mainstream. This too was eager to be implemented politically and people of lesser value were terminated. Schools don't even teach this, because everybody must be hypnotized by Nazis, which was \"only\" subsequent related development.  Eugenics was mainstream and cleansing of the race was HIP in the whole world. But mainly in USA and Britain. And Germany later on. \n\n\nSo when somebody tells me \"trust scientist.. we are all good people now\" and have the urge to say \"f** * gullible person and teach yourself some history\". Trust in authorities is one of the WORST human flaw. And we have evidence that there are thousands of credible dissenting scientists so it is not just  to be suspecting without the reason. Among the other things what about the looming ice age scare in 70. years?\n\n\nAnd also the SAME person who was main eugenics scientist created WWF and various UN bodies dealing now with so called \"climate change\", so you have actually the very same person, who was for killing poor people (one of characterist of lesser-value human then) was actually creating very institutions I should now blindly just believe. \n\n\nThat I should just believe we are the end of times, where there very good people, very good politicians and so many altruist people who just don't want the world the end, and lazy consumers don't care, when they try to save the very planet. That somehow institutions, rulers etc. evolved to the point, that no scam is not even possible. So you can just blindly believe.

Threats that are distant in time simply don't excite the same fear or flight reaction. That's why climate change is abstract - not because people think it's too scientific.\n\n\nAt whatever point we choose to stop carbon emissions the situation is going to get significantly worse before it will get better. There's a lag in the system response and atmospheric composition does not turn on a dime.\n\n\nSo if we wait until we can see things are genuinely terrible we're locked in for them getting a lot worse. What we have seen so far is the very thin end of the wedge.\n\n\n2) People routinely experience temperature fluctuations of 20 degrees in a single day. This makes a 1 degree change in global mean surface temperature over a century seem very very small. They don't understand how big a deal that is.\n\n\nThe change in global mean surface temperature between the last glacial maximum and the pre-industrial was 3-5 degrees. The earth back then was unrecognisable despite the fact the LGM wasn't really that much colder in an absolute sense.\n\n\nWe're looking down the barrel of change of the same magnitude in the opposite direction at a rate 100 times faster.

Well, climate change policy is now on equal footing with the two. When legislation passed mandating the introduction of ethanol into our fuel as an early step to reduce carbon emissions, it created chaos in the commodities market. The price spikes had a major impact on my industry. I watched over the course of two years, clients lose their business', homes & livelihoods. I wasn't personally effected, but obviously, the impact was stunning. Today, it is agreed that the legislation by all was a wash, as the reduction in emissions from vehicles was lost in the manufacturing process. Those whom proposed the legislation went on about their lives as normal, feeling no impact. When you add the impact of trade policy like NAFTA, China's entry into the WTO, and the massive loss in jobs to working Americans, people become bitter. They soon don't trust Govt & the elites. Add, \"I'm going to shut down the coal industry\"...how did that make the millions of people in that industry feel, or others in industries that heard that? This is how you get a Donald Trump elected. I am a Liberal, but the failure of our side to understand this dynamic only exacerbates a lag in climate policy. We must address everyday working people first by enact parallel policy to climate change policy. Until then, we can argue all we want, but a massive part of the population(Both R's & D's) is not going to support anything if they pay the largest pound of flesh up front, while others feel very little impact.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Dman Nevada", "channel": "UCMkeDYVYqdQIexB_Y95DvJQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS585dZuy21h6u09OaXP3A-NJ3vsLauqXEVzg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxTilx-SzN9KZHrKit4AaABAg", "text": "I used to believe these claims about climate change until I found out that they never asked climate scientists about the usefulness of carbon taxes and tariffs. Climate scientists agree that CO2 has an impact. They don't all agree that it should be a political issue or that the impact is justification for carbon taxes and tariffs. They aren't skeptical of science they are skeptical of politicians. Here are few good reasons why:\n\n1. Humanities primate ancestors were alive when there was 4000ppm CO2. That's a hard pill to swallow when we're squawking over 400, and good evidence against runaway green house effects. \n2. In the ice core data temperature always changes before CO2 and the lag is thousands of years. So there's no evidence on a geological timescale that temperature would follow CO2.\n3. CO2 can absorb all radiation in its spectrum with its current level, increasing it makes it absorb these wavelengths a few meters further up. \n4. Water is the main green house gas by far. It absorbs a wider spectrum of light and because it moves through a huge range of altitudes it insulates Earth much better than CO2 which stays near the ground after it cools from being emitted.\n5. Plants are made of carbon and get it from the air. More CO2 could potentially make plant life grow better for that reason alone.  \n\nTeachers in environmental science classes and politicians have all been taught an oversimplified political propaganda. Our best and brightest have been deluded because CO2 does have a hard to understand, but undeniable impact. They just never realized that the impact is minuscule because no one bothered to teach them that. There are other real environmental issues and they usually involve over fishing, over grazing, deforestation, or extinction from habitat loss and toxic pollutants not green house gasses.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Cameron Bowes", "channel": "UCwAnlFbS7e9u09iNAKUaNQg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQXIXtTC5Cmsp3-yQ0wQvzKz_SP4CXPorFVQQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is because a small amount of warming, triggered by melankovich cycles releases CO2 from the ocean and the ice sheets, which in term warms the climate even more and that positive feedback leads the climate into a warmer equilibrium.\n3) yes water vapor is a stronger greenhouse, which is why we're lucky there isn't much of it; the partial pressure of WV at room temperature is about 20mbar.

{"cid": "UgwjIgr0-PGspTzERV54AaABAg", "text": "Key Questions to Ask about the Truth of Climate Change\nHere are a set of questions, any of which would lead to the conclusion that we don’t need to spend a dime on global warming.  I will assume that for each question that we answer in support of climate change.  Just realize that at any point of the questions that a no or not sure invalidates any logic that we should spend billions or trillions of dollars.\n\n\n 1)  Is the world actually warming?  \n\nThe earth has actually been in a cooling phase or at least a pause for the last 18 years.  Thus the change to climate change to further obfuscate the issue.  But let us say the earth is warming, then the question is:\n\n\n2)  Is the climate change significant enough to pose a threat to the planet?  \n\nThe earth has been going thru changes in climate constantly, from seasons, to decades to eons.  Normal fluctuations have been occurring forever without humans being the cause.  But again let’s assume there is some sort of threat that we should pay attention to.\n\n\n3)  Is the climate change being caused by humans?  \n\nCO2, the culprit most cited by global warming alarmist, is only  400 parts per million in the atmosphere.  The vast majority of CO2 comes from the oceans, decaying biomass and volcanoes.  Only one-tenth of CO2 comes from humans or 40 parts in one million.  CO2 has ranged from 7,000 parts per million to as low as 180 parts per million - and life survived.  In fact in times of higher CO2 concentrations, agriculture flourished, famine was reduced and human advancement increased.  But let’s for argument sake global warming is real, it poses a threat and it is man made.\n\n\n\n4)  Is there something that we can practically do to change the threat of global warming?\n\nShort of shutting down all fossil fuel consumption, what is it we can do?  Will better MPG or electric cars (which use energy from electric plants that predominately burn fossil fuels) stop climate change?  Will going to all solar and wind help?  BTW only about 3% of US energy comes from the highly subsidized and a yet unprofitable businesses.  We do not technology or resources to provide the energy needed to run the US economy; and won’t have it for decades.  If we shut everything down will it make a difference?  What data, analysis, or studies show that a 100% effort by humans would change the natural temperature cycles the earth has experienced?  But let’s assume we can, next question:\n\n\n\n5)  If there are practical things we can do, are they affordable?   Who is going to pay for all this climate change remediation?  \n\nDo we even have a plan of what actions we would take, what the timeline would be, or most importantly how much it would cost?  Will the poorest 120 countries contribute any money?  Probably not.  will India or China (who both out pollute the US) agree to divert huge national resources away from their growing economies to solve a problem that many believe doesn’t even exist.  can the US, which already $20T in debt have the resources?  All the billionaires in the US only have about 2.2T and all the millionaires only about $19T.  Where does the money come from?  Especially if we want to continue to increase entitlements?  But let’s assume we can afford it.  \n\n6)  Do we as citizens of the world have the political will to allow our leaders to effect massive changes that directly affect our pocketbooks, our lifestyles and consumption patterns?   \n\nWould we be willing to go back to the lifestyle of the pre-industrial world?  No electricity, no cars, no iPhones, no lights, no A/C?  Okay, maybe no that drastic - how about limiting car usage, rationing electricity,  moving us all into smaller “sustainable” homes?  \n\nIf we restrict fossil fuels won’t people start cutting down trees to heat their homes and doing other unhealthy environmental things?  What do we do when nations ignore the rules?  Do we succumb to a one-world government that has the power and control to force us?\n\nIs it global warming real? Is it a threat? Are humans a significant cause? Is there something we can do about it?  Can we afford to fix it? \n\nFinally, are we all willing to sacrifice, money, freedoms, and lifestyle to make it happen? It is a lot of ifs, and I for one am not willing to give government further control of my life on a bunch of flimsy ifs.  \n\nI am not a climate denier, I am a government skeptic!!

The forth coming glacial period will not be pleasant for humans. Fourth a rising temperature will result in rising water vapour content in the atmosphere thus reducing drought.

This is not going to affect the temperature of the planet. The Sun heats the planet not a band of co2 just 240mm thick.

(Well, the actual problem was regulations which made it next to impossible to dispose of the dredged silt, but the effect was the same.) That, coupled with hill farming subsidies which have led to stripping of vegetation from uplands, leading to fast runoff of water. \n\nNow, I ask you, who predicted catastrophic floods, when, and what relation do those organisations have to the regulatory bodies whose stupidity in preventing watercourse maintenance in a land which always has had heavy rainfall, led to these catastrophic floods?\n\nOf course, you might wonder if it was actually stupidity. It did not surprise me at all when the floods were claimed to be proof of climate change. \n\nMy sympathy goes to all those who have lost their homes through this corruption. I myself narrowly avoided being one of their number. I sold rather than continue to take the risk on an uninsurable house in a street where two neighbours had been flooded out. On speaking to one of the local watercourse maintainers he made the situation clear to me. The house I sold at a reduced price has not since been flooded, and that is because the watercourses were cleared.  \n\nRound about this time I became interested in climate change, and with my scientific background I was not prepared to take propaganda or hyperbole at face value.

The \nclimate is always changing. That man made climate is so low to the \neffect it is almost nil. The earth used to have a lot more carbon and a \nlot more warmer. The Sun is the biggest effect on our climate The \nmagnetic field of the earth and gravity. As I write this other planets \nare going through weather changes and man is not there. Fact water is a \ngreenhouse gas which I do not know why these people do not mention it. \nProof..... ever heard of humidity? Or the humidex factor to temperature?\n Another fact most of the weather data at ground level is done near \ncities. Hense concrete jungles hold onto heat as in they heat up so does\n metal. Walk on a road then walk on grass in your bare feet. . big \ntemperature change.. Oh one more thing the sun is going through a cycle \nwhere the sun spots are getting smaller in numbers when that happens the\n earths climate does change a lot. This is also the beginning of a mini \nice age when the sun does this. Also Artic Ice has been melting for the \nlast 50,000 years or longer.  The Earth also has a Axis Wobble. As in \noour planets axis changes a few degrees it may not seem like much but it\n will effect our weather. Fact is we need more C02. It may look weird to\n say it but with more trees can convert it and absorb the carbon. Just \nin case you cant see it but agriculture needs C02 Do you actually think \nour food that is grown does not need C02 for food itself. In other \nwords. All this climate change stuff is focusing on Carbon and nothing \nelse. We are tropical creatures hense why we evolved out of a tropical \narea. Remember there was a time when North America never even had snow \nand life was in abundance. Until an asteroid said hi and paid a visit.\n\nJust saying if one thinks its just man and nothing else at all can \neffect our temperature. Then I guess the reason why cities flood has \nnothing to do that concrete and asphault do not absorb water. \n\nJust saying look at the bigger picture first. Thats why I do not trust \nmost of these so called climate people because they do not focus on all \nvariables. Even the creator of the weather network and an original \nstarter of the organization greenpeace do not believe these things.\n\nYou can look around, search, review everything, and then do it again \nuntil you cant poke holes in your thoughts anymore and I promise you \nthat you will see it differently.

This = warming of 4'c as calculated by most scientific bodies around the world. Lag time circa 20 - 40 years. Now add in our second most powerful green house gas Water Vapour. For every 1'c of warming water vapour increases by 7%. 4'c = 28% increase in Water Vapour + compounding of 2%. Water vapour increases SRF by another 2w/m2 or 2'c. So that's 6'c so far. Scientists studying Methane Clathrate/Hydrate dissolution know that the Earth must warm by 6'c for deep sea Methane Clathrate/Hydrate to become unstable and dissolve.

C4 and CAM photosynthesis plants are actually at a disadvantage. This includes corn which is not only a staple food crop but a staple for biofuel production (ethanol). Second of all, C3 plants growing faster and producing more sugar is at the expense of nutrient density. This means that C3 crops humans eat are getting more sugary and less nutritious with increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2. That's definitely a downside. Plants are also affected by climate change because they cannot expand their range as rapidly as animals can, since they're immobile. As temperatures rise, the ideal range of plants will be further from the equator. Plants that don't adapt quickly enough will become extinct. Another way is through desertification. Deserts are EXPANDING, forests aren't getting bigger. Deserts = less green cover and very little biodiversity.

No person was there to say what things were like so we rely on testing to tell us what it was like but even then it's an educated guess, not a certainty.

There really isn't a lack of factual evidence (which is about as certain as you can be about anything) that climate change as it's occurring NOW is human driven. It's not saying that humans are the only cause, but they are the main contributor. Obviously there are lots of other natural factors that contribute to climate fluctuations but the changes occurring now are unprecented. Scientific analysis is not the same as an \"educated guess\". Hypotheses and theories about climate change may not be 100% correct but they are backed by ample empirical findings. Nothing is for certain if you want to get down into it, and climate science is a field of active research. Skepticism is important but denying human-driven climate change is ignoring mountains of data and empirical evidence, and is similar to denying evolution or the theory of gravity. Nearly everyone who denies human-driven climate change has not even taken the time to learn the science of it, including mechanisms down to the molecular level. It's also not that hard to put two and two together. Manmade industry releases gases like CO2, NOx, CH4 etc (more so than things like volcanoes) Atmospheric concentrations of these gases increase. These gas molecules capture heat energy due to their rotational chemistry and re-emit it back to the earth. Earth warms. It's not rocket science... but it is science.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "nazoya", "channel": "UCU7qVCSxeGDhKVBL20uHmpg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSrEAwVywKWGtAiVYKxdG6gTswcZvE7mp5rQ-lF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

How can your write with education such a comment looking like you never ever did learn something ?\nShould I really answer this ?\n\n1. \" Mankind's emissions aren't mainly CO2.\"\nWhat then ? Of course the most emitted greenhouse gas by mankind is CO2.\nAlso it is the most relevant because it is that much emitted and CO2 stays very long in the atmosphere means you have really an ADD of greenhouse gases = an ADD of warming / energy.\n\n2. \"Who are you to determine how much we should/shouldn't consume.\"\nWhy me I never said that it is me ? Of course if earth population is too great and does produce/consume too much is not me saying and if I only would say so it would be pointless, irrelevant also when someone else say it is pointless and it would not matter at all, instead it is education and it is shown in research, observation and very well know by everyone world wide that mankind by population and transfer resources into pollution is leading to an uninhabitable environment for life, this is not what I say or someone say !! This is very clear by education and knowledge, I can not mention all the research and was done in this field would fill up the whole comment section here on you tube. Only the studies and research of bioversity are there in billions and are very clear about it and this only a small fraction of all the research done to this subject. \nThe question is more, even when you never was in school and never heard of extinction today, overpopulation, ending resources, vanishing nature by mankind, you read this every day in the news, so how the hell you did not get this education and knowledge ??\nYou are living in a fantasy world ? What I or someone else say does not matter at all and nothing worth at all, in respect there are facts about it, research and results based on science.\n\nI did even ask do I need to explain it, because it is very clear for everyone, I think not that there is someone world wide not even someone in a poor country never been to school is not familiar with this fact.   ", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "橋本絵莉子", "channel": "UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQK4hb36gs5GaEe_1j3PgmRG1qNbq6rS2C9Au8M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Thanks to the IPCC, the Public doesn´t know that the Sun is causing all the warming on earth.\nIt is so stupid, also when everything is right that been said in respect to Thanks to the IPCC - it is always up to us what we do learn not to the IPCC, I never heard the scientists of the IPCC would not know that water vapor is the most effective Greenhouse Gas also when this is for the anthropogenic climate change very irrelevant and unimportant, because CO2 is mostly causing all the warming and not water vapor.\nThe IPCC is also not only looking onto CO2 this is non-sense it is very clear in detail also water vapor is very clear and calculated, measured, observed in details, but yes of course the focus is on the CO2 which is the most relevant problem and the most rising variable.\nAlso this article is not scientific like it says \" This claim is false because CO2 levels have risen for 18+ years while temperature hasn’t increased,\" without a source without a year and date and the figure is of 1750 and does say nothing about climate change.\nAlso the word most Water vapor is the most important Greenhouse Gas is not right in this article, it is the most relevant for the greenhouse efx what is right, no one ever did deny this and this is very middle school education so everyone knows, but this has nothing to do with the anthropogenic climate change and not with global warming everyone knows, because there is no ADD and no Plus at all in water vapor but a lot in CO2 and Methane.\nAnd the author is a Heartland Institute Member = political Lobbyist for the Oil industry.

I said there the problem can not be solved, but has to be in the next 10 years (about).\nIt is easy to grasp also when my English is not so good - yes you did not get what I have said there. \nExample: You have to catch the Bus in 8 min. because it will arrive at the bus station in 8 min., but your location atm is 6 hours away from this bus station, so it is very likely that you will never catch the the bus in the right time, because of the circumstances that you are 6 hours away from the location and there is no solution known - that you can over-come with technology or the laws of nature the 6 hours of distance. But still it might be very unlikely possible, because it is not tried and not proven to be true - that you will not make it in science, there might be perhaps some did build a new vehicle right next to you and will lend you this, which can over-come the distance is 5 sec. then you can reach the bus and still have time to smoke a cigarette while waiting. \n\nSo you will never catch the bus, but when you want to get it you have to do it in the next 8 min. (about a bus can also come and go late, earlier) is reality for you.\n\n2. Nature is not random at all, it is by rules very defined it is also called nature of science or Math, Chemics, Physics and of course Biology. Also when there are some Chaos Systems - nature does obey to laws and rules like everyone and everything in the universe. Life is a random results and also of natural rules/laws of the right circumstances that will lead to life and nature is life supporting as it is also not, depends on which field you are speaking of.\n3. There might be negative Feedbacks in the climate system caused by the warming which can turn into cooling = negative, so thus we might in such a case not extinct as long as there is of course no emissions or only very less emission, so thus it will and can not shift again into warming. But this seems to be very unlikely, but very unlikely possible of course. \n4. You are uneducated, ok when we are speaking of all the greenhouse gases what kind of greenhouse gases instead of CO2 is relevant ? The answer is no one of the others.\n5. Yes increasing greenhouse gases do increase warming, but here is only CO2 the most increasing greenhouse gas and the most relevant add to the atmosphere by staying a long time, not like water which is a bit add by all the CO2 warming and short time an add, not methane which is also a bit added and not staying staying so long in the atmosphere, in respect methane does split-up by a part into CO2 in the atmosphere, so again CO2 increasing and staying much longer and not another greenhouse gas.\n6. It is possible that a negative feedback can cool the climate of course, there are already negative feedbacks, but yes the heat energy is still there and the problem not solved - you are right in that last point.\n7. No it does not violate Thermodynamics at all. A negative feedback is not breaking the laws of thermodynamics, I never heard something like this, this would make negative feedbacks impossible to exist, also you would prove the law of thermodynamics on every single negative feedback and will see when this law is there to find it will not be violated.\n8. No the earth is heating up atm by greenhouse gases and not by extra energy from the sun, the sun is in a cooling state by a great sunspot minimum atm. But the sun will not cool down earth so much in the next time that we will survive also not the sun-earth cycles.", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "橋本絵莉子", "channel": "UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQK4hb36gs5GaEe_1j3PgmRG1qNbq6rS2C9Au8M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Uggvk5j7gx0z2XgCoAEC.8IBc9XDyMC38RsgEabeBW9", "text": "1. LOL Yes that was an theoretical example, where the goal is to catch the bus: What I wanteded to say is that it is theortical possible to catch the Bus, there are many reasons - it can also be possible that the bus does stuck in a traffic jam or whatever, I can give here a lot of chaotic examples and you can make it somehow to catch the bus, but like I said and you too: This is not very reality and it is not possible to explain why you still should get the bus - it is only a scientifically not clear and proven and there is a little uncertainty and change that somehow you can still catch that bus.\n And I did show you why you will not catch the bus, but it is still time to catch the bus. With what I said about the climate you had problems to understand: It is very the same - it is too late to react on the climate, even when this is in future and it is still time to react on this problem, but it will very likely not change the results / has no effect because it is too late and cricumstances are not to change from our possibilities today.\n\n2. \" .....I had no idea so all those laws make nature and intelligent being that acts with a purpose? \"\nYes and No of course Nature can be smart like mankind is of course. Yes Nature and Evolution has a purpose of surviving, adaptation and reproduction. But Laws of Nature can not be called smart, these are just rules and circumstances in our reality which can not be broken and are always taking place only by these rules, so nature is not random, it is binded to rules and stituations / circumstances in our reality and nature can not over-come these rules in respect some Exceptions like Black-Holes for example.\n\n4. \"Also we don't know all of the factors effecting natural phenomena\"\nWe know what we know and this is a lot of course, we know by the most all the natural disaters which are causing them and if the changing climate is the most relevant part or not, there is not much left we did not discover till now. We make out of this knowledge our conclusions and not by the things we do not know, it would be also impossible in science to come to results and conclusions without beeing able to explain it by knowledge = laws, research, experiments and data which are all very explained by the Laws and knowledge which has to be right and are proven to be right and reality.\n\n5. \"so for all intents and purposes if something is unpredictable and continually changing\"\nEverything can be predicted, but only in a limited frame, even what a free, complex, intelligent Individual (like Mankind) is doing next - is very predictable, when the data are there. In nature it is even much more easy - everyting is mostly predicatble, when the data are there. But limited in a frame,  when it comes to very sensitive, complex systems and a longer timescale of course, but you can make always trends and relevant predictions, which are very useful and reliable about everything. That is why we are also putting a lot of money into so many simulations and estimations not matter in which fields: Architecture, Economic, Social Behavior, Crime, Food production, Political Behavior, flight and other technical simulations, simlations in Chemics, Physics, Biology this is an endless list, also every person do make also its own estimations and prediction daily, which are not very scientifically and not very positionless, without much data and not often rechecked, but do help us as individuals and makes an individual personality.  \n\n6. \" variable so we can predict exact events\"\nThis is impossible even to make a statement very in detail/exact about complex systems are not possible and to predict them in detail is not possible too, You have to take out the \"detail\" or \"exact\", because no one can ever do this.  Even not on many events that are already taking place before your eyes and you can do measure very precise it is getting impossible, because there is always much smaller, much greater possible and many more.\nExample: Car-Crash Simulation VS Reality, Flight Simulation VS Reality, Economic Market Development VS Reality.\nYou have to point out which of all the elements are the most relevant and got the most changing influence and how much, also the time-frame and factors you have to limit mostly, so you come to results, when you take an event and respect every aspect - no matter how unimportant they are, then you will never get results and you will never have time to come to results. Example Car Crash Simulation: You will need sensors for every Atom of the Carstructure and the Dummies and simulate endless realistic situations that can be possible to make a saver car, with every possible object in the car with every possible object to collide, with every natural ... possible influence in weather, temp, chemical.... impact that is possible. This is not how it does work, you want to test special abilities/weaknesses, which can be problematic/or an progress in situations are often reality and then you can by time making these simulation - always more realstic and add new type of senarios which are relevant, you gain knowledge and education by all the work, which you can teach and make this more realistic, helpful / precise in a relative needed farme.    \n\n7. \"The feedback loop you are talking about that causes run-away global warming is a positive one and is based on WATER VAPOR!!! \"\nNo, the run-away global warming is based on a lot of positive feedbacks, water vapor is one of a positive feedback can be also a negative feedback at the same time, but more relvant as positive feedback, water vapor is not compared to other natural emissions not very relvant to the run-away climate - here are more natural Methane and CO2 relevant, because they are emitted not constant to the warming, these emissions are all emitted when the melting point of their sealing is reached, water vapor is constant vaporising by the warming and only short time living in the water cycle. And there are a lot more positive feedbacks much more relvant then water vapor, like the albedo effect, changing jet and ocean streams,.....\n\n8. \"Therefore any greenhouse gas would contribute to that WATER VAPOR POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP!!\"\nYes very right -> more greenhouse gases, more warming, more water vapor by warming, will lead to more warming and more Water Vapor again - it is a cycle.\n\n9. \" Yet you focus only one CO2 and you also ignore methane and say that it is also CO2... if we stopped all CO2 emissions world wide, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would still increase as we have 7 billion people and hundreds of billions of animals farting! Additionally, all living organisms dying and releasing methane that breaks down into CO2 in the atmosphere! That is not including natural methane leaks from the earth itself.\" \nMethane is not so relvant as greenhouse gases as CO2 is much more, but it is the 2nd one relevant directly after CO2. Methane is splitting up in the atmosphere by a part to CO2 so it is also a CO2 problem, but methane is not so much added into the atmosphere (by methane we talk about  ppb parts per billion and CO2 ppm = parts per million) also when methane is a much stronger greenhouse gas and even water is much stronger, those are not very long in the atmosphere are do not got the greatest ADD of warming over the normal cycle which did always warm earth before.\nWhen the problem would be a tree CO2 would be the roots and methane a giant branch of the tree but getting bigger and bigger because the roots are growing and water vapor is also branch but not so big as methane and also growing and growing because of the roots are getting bigger and stronger - to make it simple and to show that CO2 is by the ADD and long term staying the main problem which does also cause the all the other greenhouse gases to become more a problem, but you can cut the roots to make the other problems vanish but not a branch to make the problem vanish. It is also like you would say we need to plant more trees, will not function, we are increasing CO2 emissions and already now we need to plant a lot of trees to go down 1 C degree we did already add and you will never manage to come up with enough trees to get by the rate of emissions, also it will not make sense on some point because by all the impacts even today trees will be harmed by the climate impacts and you have even to plant much more and also the time that a tree needs to be effected and it need years to grow will make it impossible, also when phyloplankton got impacts of the climate and is going to extinct and is even much more transverting CO2 out of the atmosphere , trees planting will not help and without stopping CO2 to cause more heat energy then it will be impossible. Or like a boat is running full of water you can pump out the water but when the hole is getting bigger and water is still running into the boat you will not solve the problem even if you got very great working pumps and an ever functionl energy source for the pumps and the high CO2 level always added by emissions, is like the water added always into the boat.", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "橋本絵莉子", "channel": "UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQK4hb36gs5GaEe_1j3PgmRG1qNbq6rS2C9Au8M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

After all these years of No - CO2 - emissions, it will be very effective binded in the carbon cycle of earth, also the global temp will go down to a normal Level, but there is no more that time frame and yes still all the positive feedbacks and the emissions of today will hit us the next decades and will lead to a run-away climate - this is correct and very likely.  \nMethane or animal farting is not very relevant to the warming it is a small part, when you would limit methane, it will take effect in much shorter time in a few years, but it will be pointless/ not significant in the global temp / global warming, in respect to the possible natural methane releases which are coming from permafrost / Oceanground but only because they are there in very very large amounts and are relesing by their melting points, but this is not much today the problem but this is today an very rapid increasing problem and will be one of the most relevant positive feedbacks.\n\n11. \"Negative feedback loops as you have said countless times would lead to cooling, not warming... only positive feedback loops would contribute to warming.\"\nYes that is correct.\n\n12. \"Positive feedback loops that would be required for you catastrophic unstoppable warming, violate the laws of Thermodynamics!\"\n No they do not, these are different possitive feedbacks you have pick one, they do not violate the laws of thermodynamics, \nExample 1:  There is stored methane sealed in permafrost - more warming (under the laws of thermodynamic) by mankind CO2 emissions will melt down the permafrost and release more natural methane emissions - which were not before in the atmosphere in our era and is an ADD and PLUS, will lead to much more greenhouse gases(ADD and PLUS) in the atmosphere and lead to much more warming (because of an ADD and PLUS), also under the laws of thermodynamic of course and this will again cause more permafrost to melt (or other positive feedbacks glacier to melt).           \nExample 2: More warming will lead to glacier melting much less energy will be reflecetd back into space and much more will be absorbed by dark matter (albedo effect), will lead to more warming and will lead to much more melting (of Glaciers or other positive effects).\n\nThere is no law violated.\n\n13. \"Positive feedback loops, however, are not possible given all of the observations that lead to the formation of the laws of Thermodynamics! \"\nHuh ? Positive like negative feedbacks do not violate the laws.\n\n14. \"And if positive feedback loops were possible then we wouldn't have to burn anything ever again for our energy needs!\" \nSolar energy, wind energy, water energy, ground thermal energy are all function without bruning something, but energy solutions got nothing to do with positive feedbacks in the climate system, the climate does not produce electricity and the energy from the positive feedbacks are not coming from no where - like the energy you burn from fossil fuel does also not coming from no where, this is energy - which was there before, but not added to the earths energy system as warming in our era or that way before - to say it simple.    \n\n15. A single positive feedback loop that created increasing warming would be effectively the best energy generator humans have ever known! Even better than solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, and all fossil fuels! A generator built on a positive heat feedback loop would replace every type of energy generator that we have today!\"\nYou can not compare this, like you want to and for all the positive feedbacks we did invest/produced/did use a lot of energy to get more Energy in Global Warming by positive feedbacks and yes some people do also reuse emissions like CO2 to produce even much more energy = Carbon Recycling, but this is of course not so efficient then to burn much higher energy resources like gas, coal, oil.....  \nBut solar energy is in someway trapping more energy from the sun transformed into electricity, like wind is also Energy from the sun transformed into chemical and kentic energy so called wind and transformed by wind turbines again into electricity - but they are not Perpetuum mobiles the external energy source is the sun of course in positive feedbacks there are also always an external energy source -> the sun mostly.  \nFor all the natural methane emissions (possitive feedback) to trap more heat energy by the sun, is a result of all the energy \"We mankind\" did produced by a lot of energy we did put as CO2 into the system and did warm the planet then by more natural emissions caused to be unsealed by all of the energy we did produced over many years in the increasing of global warming.\nAlso the Albedo Effect, we did by a lot of energy producing CO2 to warm-up the planet and trapping more heat energy by the sun which does melt glaciers and will then even lead to much more warming.\nThere is always a lot energy needed to cause the postive feedbacks, they are not a Perpetuum mobile and not violate the laws of energy and not the laws of thermodynamics,  when I did understand you right this time ?\n\nThis time you comment was much better, you talk more in the scientific fields what this topic is about.", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "橋本絵莉子", "channel": "UC_tEHjDnFVVXu7dtIEyptvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQK4hb36gs5GaEe_1j3PgmRG1qNbq6rS2C9Au8M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Isn't it possible that this world is designed to support human life, even a huge amount of human life? It certainly appears that way.\n\nEven if the world is fast filling up with human life, that does not at all mean that we can stop growing, nor even that we should.\n\nAnd a worse life, can not mean a few rich people inconvenienced by having people spoil the scenic view of the land. Vague feeling of supposed overcrowding, have no place in a discussion that purports to be scientific.\n\nHow do you know that Earth couldn't someday be like the Star Wars planet, Coruscant, with a trillion+ people and all the world is one big city? Anyway, the point is, that the world is nowhere near full of people, not anytime within the foreseeable future at least.\n\nIsn't it far more likely, that evil rich NWO criminal elitists, want to ban cars, so that they can feel more relatively rich compared to the shrinking middle class, as cars are increasingly banned, well except for the filthy rich elitists of course, who rather than earning their money, stole it from the working class? The NWO elitists are too much like the greedy parasites that kill their host, so that they soon die also.\n\nDon't be disheartened? I am against CO2 emissions reduction targets, because they are designed to ruin economies and promote poverty. More people is great, but more population + more poverty is not the ideal combination. Shouldn't we be creating wealth and options to better deal with and absorb rising human populations?\n\nSo-called green energy is a massive scam, and it is bad and wrong fake science. Is it even an intentional diversion from looking into free-energy?\n\nDo I have to explain free-energy again? I get so tired of explaining it all the time. Doesn't anybody know anything? Free-energy might come from tapping the ambient thermal energy in the air, from low-energy nuclear reactions that do not produce radiation, or from the subatomic energy particle foam of quantum mechanics. According to Atlas Shrugged, an old book and now a DVD trilogy, their free-energy machine draws static out of the air, to produce free electricity. Sounds like Star Trek techno-babble to me. But their way of explaining something that the author didn't yet quite understand exactly how it would work. Free-energy solves all the problems of what people hate about \"green\" energy. It is reliable, 24-7, highly portable at least enough to power cars, it is far cheaper than \"green\" energy, and it has no emissions. What could be better for an increasingly populous world. Now do I have to explain why the evil elitists, would try to ban or deny that free-energy probably exists already?", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Yosef MacGruber", "channel": "UCzvwk7CJXhK5ZkDGTAgrepA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRYcFOm9nLFP3j6ptujl4mSptz9DTFaF-Tz4UXI=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Why would it be occurring? Because free-energy technology is being suppressed, because the evil NWO criminal elitists want us paying the phony energy tax? Also, world population is rising, increasing the human load upon the planet to meet all these people's needs. As a pro-lifer, I believe it entirely appropriate that human populations should naturally grow and spread, as much as God may allow us to. I also very much agree with huge numbers of people's objections to the use of birth control. Is that not important that people be fed and have decent homes to live in?\n\nAnd why should we assume that the cost of food would double? The idea was, that summer might last so long, as to provide time to produce two crops per year, and not just one. Increased CO2 causes plants to grow faster, thus also more food. Also, nature seems to self-balance in many ways, thus a very heavily populated world would likely even naturally adjust in many ways to allow for it. And that is not even talking of all the ways that intelligent humans might adapt and adjust. The rising cost-of-living, is a measure of government corruption.

Second of all, it is indicated in the climate patterns over the last several million years that we should be going into another ice age, a process which would go unnoticed by most people due the several thousand years it takes. Unfortunately, due to the greenhouse effect, which is drastically different from any other word you spewed out with no understanding as it is an cause of climate change, not actual climate change, the radiation emitted by our sun is less likely to escape our atmosphere due to a thicker atmosphere. This imbalance of the radiation (which you feel as heat from the sun) coming in and going out of our atmosphere causes the slight warming of the entire planet's atmosphere. When this happens to a great enough extent, we encounter a phenomena known as global warming, in which the entire planet is effected to the point that this worldwide warming becomes noticeable. This results in shifts in our incredibly fragile climate, which is why scientists, and other people who understand how this works, mention climate change so often. So, as you would know if you either researched this or had a decent education, they are not the same thing, they never were the same thing and they never will be. As with all scientific theories, the concept of climate change via global warming is always evolving, but these basics will always be the same. Finally, climate change has never been debunked and it probably never will be.

Like huge numbers of people, I also have many objections to all methods of birth control. I believe that humans really should not restrain the natural growth of our numbers.\n\nDid you mean \"safest\" way, or most sure way? But both can easily be disputed. Most people are especially against such draconian population control measures, and even if population growth might be a concern, I think most people still do not see much anything that can be done to slow population growth. Only decades ago, even \"overpopulation\" talk seemed to admit that population growth could not really much controlled at all. It was acknowledged that so many people have objections to birth control. And there has been a lot of thought that people really do want families of a size that keeps population growing.\n\nWe have to make room for more people, as our numbers rise by another billion people per decade. Why does anybody think we have any choice, as to whether to make room for more people? People do not want to be told how many children they can have. When we have people in my own congregation, who have as many as 5 and 6 children, it perhaps tells me something about where I hope that the world population situation is going. I welcome a human-denser world, as it is the right pro-life thing to do. There is just getting to be so many of us humans, and human life is a big deal, every human life is of immense value, and every human life is sacred. Many people believe that sex should remain ever open to the prospect of pregnancy, meaning do not take any preventative measures to block pregnancy, lest sex is made to be profaned, selfish, and carnal. I think that contraceptives are so disgusting in so many ways.\n\nAs a pro-lifer, of course I agree with reducing premature and unnecessary deaths, while leaving birthrate naturally high as it should be. There is no moral imperative to somehow keep the world from naturally \"blowing up\" with people. Let human population grow however high that they can get to. God knows what he is doing, and what is good for us.\n\nNo reverse option? Why would we want to go backwards? More and more people would be glad to live. Let baby booms take hold all over the world, and let human population soar as it may. God commanded that we humans multiply, so that makes population size, God's determination, and not that of small-thinking evil and rebellious elitist power-mad men.\n\nBTW, people in Nigeria say that children are gifts from God, they see their population growth as good for their economy, and people there seem to want as many children as they can produce. What really is wrong with such pro-life thinking? You do know that in many countries of the world, not so much like the wicked or corrupted West, abortion is still frowned upon and banned. Human life is a big deal. Our ancestors believed that growth is good, and I believe that human populations everywhere should still grow naturally, meaning without use of any means of birth control.

It seems to be seriously overstated, but couldn't that be a possible answer? By allowing massive super-populations, increasing heavily populated regions, it allows people to continue to reject birth control, and to have however many children that they have. At least it answers the question as to how might we find or make room for countless billions more people upon the planet. So I am much in favor of that, if or as needed. However, I prefer that people spread out more evenly, so of course I am opposed to the NWO Agenda 21, because it is obviously anti-growth, designed to promote needless poverty and government corruption, and because it seeks to keep people from encroaching into wilderness areas by cramming them into poorly-built cities against their will. Rather a more logical question to ask would seem to be, What if it increasingly takes the the entire planet just to hold us all? Then shouldn't we be encouraging people to spread out, if they can or want to?\n\nTake action on overpopulation? That sounds needlessly brutal and cruel, and quite unnecessary. What could be more natural for people, than to let their babies naturally push out? But then, shouldn't you be in favor of exposing the massive scam, of the evil NWO criminal elitists, having stolen free-energy technology from Tesla and the American people? The universe is full of energy, and so why are we still paying for energy? Energy should be free by now. Free-energy technology can power cars, entire cities, even the entire world, without emissions, and unlike so-called \"green energy\", free-energy is reliable, very cheap or free, and 24-7.

How do you keep ignoring the immense value and sacredness of every human life?\n\nWhat if the parents can support their large families? What if economies were not rigged by corrupt governments, to spread poverty?\n\nEducation can also be done by home-schooling and internet-schooling, which now has almost no cost per child. More children do not make it more expensive. Books are becoming replaced by electronic-books, that have minimal costs of publishing, and there is so much educational content that is absolutely free on the internet. Rather than building expensive government monopoly school buildings, we could also have students stay home and study their lessons and take quizes on their Android tablets.\n\nI heard of somewhere, I guess some rich person's foundation funding the mass-production of cheap computers for developing countries, computers that could be powered with a hand-crank, for just $100 per computer, I think it was. With the modern technology, such computers could come with lessons preloaded on them, taking a student all the way through college-level courses. And obviously these computers can be used in villages that do not even have electricity. Yet so much of the world, is already electrically-wired.\n\nPeople are glad to live after the fact, thus it is good that more people be conceived and come alive, before the fact. Just because you may not yet be aware of your desire to live, does not mean that your conception was some sort of \"mistake\" or unnecessary.\n\nSex Ed is perversion, because it is usually run by perverts. Come on, do not ignore the political realities. I am not talking about those old drawings in biology or human health textbooks, of the human reproductive organs. It would seem to have literary merit and educational content. But back in the day, it wasn't promoting all the sexual immorality. I have even seen at a bookstore (because I know to check for things to monitor the decline of the American culture), some children's book about the human body or something, and it showed a cartoon drawing of the erect penis fully inserted into the vagina, and the baby growing in the womb on the next 2 facing pages. Not one mention of sex outside of marriage, nor of sexual perversions, nor of the rampant contraceptive pushing, nor of the trendy and stupid mad-scientist concern that maybe the planet now has just too much human life. Thus, why would I object to such \"Sex Ed\", as I didn't find the usual perversions in it? I much agree that the reproductive organs should be ever connected and used for reproduction. It seems to have literary merit, and parents who do not approve, need not buy that book. Also, such a book probably does meets community standards now, as it just seems to be that everybody just has to have, and is having so much sex.\n\nHow can you deny that contraceptives are unnatural? Obviously, humans were designed to multiply, and to not use birth control. We should not hinder the natural flow of human life, as even nature wants us to grow, and because it so benefits more people. If the human life is flowing more and more, then so be it. If human reproduction is becoming more and more a mighty force of nature then we should embrace and respect that, and even promote the proper and natural transition towards an increasingly populous world. Most people naturally are opposed to imposition of population control upon humans, and huge numbers of people actually do not see any real need to restrain human fertility. They are okay with their fertility and make no effort to go against the nature and the human life in trying to control it. This is not just religion, but also philosophy, and respect for nature in allowing for and welcoming the natural increase of humanity.\n\nI understand the concern about human life just increasingly filling up and dominating the biosphere. As a pro-lifer, of course I have no objection to this eventuality or reality. But that does not at all mean that human rights should be lessened, nor that the natural reproductive urges reduce any, nor that every human life, is somehow not as precious. Just because populous countries such as China and India might be spewing massive pollution into the planet, does not at all mean that just \"too many\" babies is to blame. Don't forget, they are manufacturing your stuff, for Westerners. What do you expect when they are run by crappy communist or inept governments, and we have so over-regulated pollution restrictions, so as to export our jobs to countries with not so much environmental standards? You don't solve pollution problems by polluting the human body directly with contraceptives. Also, I do not believe that nature is out to get us. Pollution is not as bad of a problem, as the rampant contraceptive pushing that really attacks moral values, pushes for cruel abortions, and is just really so harsh against the human life. Just because there are too many people peeing into the ditch or the rivers, does not mean that there are too many people, rather than they need to modernize and to get more toilets.\n\nBut most people do have the very powerful natural urge to reproduce, and most people do produce children, and to \"Stop at just 2 children\", which is say to be \"replacement level\" reproduction, is needlessly harsh, unrealistic, and unnecessary.

For example, grass is meant to grow but we still mow our lawns to keep it neat... that's kind of how I see birth contraceptives as. How is it \"against nature\"? If we invented birth contraceptives, then surely it is completely natural for us to use them to our needs? It isn't harming anyone. You also say that since human reproduction is a force of nature, we should embrace it. Well, isn't disease, drought, and famine also a force of nature? Why don't we embrace that, too, and let people die freely as it is supposedly \"nature's will\"? With the creation of life also always comes death, both are equally a \"force of nature\", are they not? I know this is a bit extreme, but that is kind of how your mindset/perspective seems to me. Besides, humans are always trying to control nature to some extent. Pesticides, herbicides, agriculture and cultivation, all of these are examples. If we want to respect nature. we would/should not exploit the planet to such an extent that we are causing so many species to become endangered. In fact, many species today are becoming extinct primarily due to human activity. Also, the rate and extent in which we are exploiting the planet's natural resources is unsustainable and extremely harmful to many ecosystems.\n\nAlso, the use of contraceptives is completely up to the each individual as to whether they are going to use them or not. I don't think anyone is pushing anyone to use them!\n\nI agree that population control should not mean human life needs to be devalued. However, I also believe that we need to take responsibility for the damage we are causing our planet. This is our only home, so we need to value it as well and treat it carefully. Pollution IS a very serious problem, probably more so than population control. Where do you think our waste goes? Sewage usually if not always ends up getting dumped into rivers and oceans. What about domestic trash? It ends up in landfills or incinerators (that cause air pollution from burning the waste). Even fertilizers used on farms is a source of pollution, because it gets into bodies of water and causes eutrophication. Even our energy sources (coal, natural gas, fossil fuels, oil, nuclear) creates waste that is considered detrimental. All of the waste we produce goes right back into the environment (nuclear waste is kind of an exception, as it gets stores in specific facilities, but nevertheless still the environment). If we increase our population, pollution will only increase unless we somehow revert to a more sustainable way of living.\n\nI truly do believe that as more females are empowered, they will not be as pressured to marry so early and have children. Females will have more options as to what path they will follow, instead of seeing motherhood as inevitable. More and more females feel less obligated to have many children or commit to maternal duties exclusively, giving them freedom to choose how to live. Women can still choose to have as many children as they want, but it is becoming more common for them to choose other options or be satisfied with one or two children.\n\nAlso, more people does not necessarily benefit more people.

I do not expect for government to take the wicked anti-life anti-family position of Planned unParenthood, and to violate our religious values using our tax money to promote immorality.\n\nAgain you are assuming that people should be pressured to use birth control, after you know that so many people simply believe in allowing babies to push out without any fertility control measures.\n\nHaving fewer children does little towards promoting a better standard of living. You can have the same house be the home of 2 children, or of 6 children. Whatever do you think that bunk-beds were invented? Probably for the natural-large families, that do not yet have the large family to match.\n\nWhy are you opining that money is of greater value than children? As if having children was some sort of luxury, rather than a biological or religious duty?\n\nI don't believe all governments are corrupt... Maybe in countries that are more behind on development, but I am in the optimal belief that most governments are trying to do what they think is best for their country (or so I hope).\n\nMost governments are corrupt, and if they were not so corrupt, then they would recognize that it is not in their jurisdiction or moral rights, to be denying or advocate against people enjoying having their children. Quite many politicians are professional liars, and ever scheming how to keep themselves in power, and giving too little thought as to what is moral or good for the country.\n\nSex education is important because it ensures that children get the education they need about the subject through their school.

Sex Ed encourages young people to indulge in sex, no matter that they are not yet married. The Bible clearly places the responsibility for children, with the parents, and not with evil edu-crats. Schools are supposed to answer to parents, thus not be so apt to accuse parents of not doing their duties. If politicians were not so much controlling the money, and if parents paid tuition to the school of their choice, then schools probably would be more eager to listen to the parents - their customers. Schools used to be more run by churches, and not by immoral liberal-retards.\n\nStudents may also be more comfortable learning about this subject through their teachers rather than their parents/guardians, but if not they are always welcome to opt out (as long as a signature is provided to do so). I don't see how sex education today promotes sexual immorality, what are you referring to?\n\nIgnorance is not an argument. Why don't you do some serious research into the controversy?\n\nGiven how controversial that Sex Ed obviously is, why wouldn't it be Opt In? That you have to have a parent's permission even to attend? Why isn't more than one view available? Why not multiple programs, and see which is more popular? Are liberal-retards afraid that more students and parents may actually choose abstinence-based?\n\nSex Ed by its very nature, is religious, so why is a \"religious\" moral view, somehow banned? Why does Planned Parenthood sue, anytime an abstinence-based or faith-based Sex Ed is installed? Because it doesn't sell them enough abortions? Because abstinence-based doesn't promote a demand for shoddy nasty contraceptives? Because being moral, doesn't honor Satan whom they follow?\n\nI don't think sex education is run by \"perverts\" either, the teachers are usually respectable people... how could you say that?\n\nIgnorance isn't an argument. Then why do they bring in \"experts\" pushing contraceptives? I think many doctors would not even be comfortable with that position, as contraceptives obviously have a lot of serious problems.\n\nI think I may have had a biology teacher say something about sex, but it seemed that at the time, or at least in the area where I attended school, teachers were of moral persuasion and probably attended a good church. And sex is very simple, so there really is not much to say about it. Sex Ed is not even enough to fill a course. It can be covered in a few pages of a textbook, or in a week.\n\nWhat is it that they are possibly teaching that could be perverted? I have never thought anything I learned in sex education was really \"perverted\"; it was primarily educational. Some students ask questions that may seem a bit inappropriate, but that's just the students and their curiosity.\n\nWell I went to some presentation at college, that was clearly morality and abstinence-based. And this was at a secular university.\n\nContraceptives are not God's standard. No sex until marriage, babies after. What is so complicated about that?\n\nI still don't quite understand why you consider contraceptives unnatural, and why that is a bad thing. For example, grass is meant to grow but we still mow our lawns to keep it neat... that's kind of how I see birth contraceptives as. How is it \"against nature\"? If we invented birth contraceptives, then surely it is completely natural for us to use them to our needs? It isn't harming anyone.\n\nI have nothing against mowing grass nor trimming the bushes. We like to alter nature to better meet the needs of the burgeoning human population. Do you even know the true reason why people started mowing grass? It is primarily a means of fire control. Overgrown brush has a way of catching on fire, during summer droughts.\n\nWhy had humans done apparently quite well without contraceptives, for over 5000 years of our history? (According to the Jewish calendar, the world is around 5776 years old.)\n\nDo you mow your arms and legs, to keep them from getting too long? Yet we prune our bushes all the time. That goes to show, that the human life is to be treated differently and more special, than some other aspects of nature.\n\nYou also say that since human reproduction is a force of nature, we should embrace it. Well, isn't disease, drought, and famine also a force of nature? Why don't we embrace that, too, and let people die freely as it is supposedly \"nature's will\"?\n\nWhich is preferable? Human reproduction, or those negative things that you mentioned? We are commanded in Deuteronomy 30;19 to choose life, that thou and thy seed may live. Is that not clear enough? How about the Ten Commandments, which you can read in Exodus 20. Thou shalt not kill. Yet abortion is considered almost like just another horrible method of birth control? Why don't we more properly support the natural increase of humanity, as was the obvious position to take before all the evil NWO rampant contraceptive pushing? The population is becoming more and more, and so we should better develop in support of that.\n\nWhy would nature want for people to die? Especially from easily preventable or treatable diseases? We see in nature that life seeks to spread into almost every niche that it can. Why not all the more so, for supposedly intelligent human life?\n\nWith the creation of life also always comes death, both are equally a \"force of nature\", are they not?\n\nThe Bible says that death is defeated in the end. Thus, they can not be regarded equally. We should favor life, obviously as we seem to like being alive. So why should there be anything wrong with human births occurring at a rate of nearly 3 times that of the deathrate?\n\nI know this is a bit extreme, but that is kind of how your mindset/perspective seems to me. Besides, humans are always trying to control nature to some extent. Pesticides, herbicides, agriculture and cultivation, all of these are examples. If we want to respect nature. we would/should not exploit the planet to such an extent that we are causing so many species to become endangered. In fact, many species today are becoming extinct primarily due to human activity. Also, the rate and extent in which we are exploiting the planet's natural resources is unsustainable and extremely harmful to many ecosystems.\n\nHumans have to alter nature, because we read in Genesis 1;26 that God gave dominion to man, over nature and over other creatures. Also, because there are now just so many of us. But why do humans dominate? I think that verse could be speaking of the sheer numbers, that God would ultimately grow us into. As a few scattered villages would be utterly unable to dominate the planet.\n\nWhy are you trying to defend the wrong but trendy, Malthusian \"overpopulation\" dogma? I am trying to get you to see, that there are far better population theories than that. What about the writings of Julian Simon, Boserub, Steven Mosher, Ben Wattenberg?\n\nAlso, the use of contraceptives is completely up to the each individual as to whether they are going to use them or not. I don't think anyone is pushing anyone to use them!\n\nNot according to those who are pushing the rampant contraceptive pushing. Ignorance is not an argument.\n\nI agree that population control should not mean human life needs to be devalued. However, I also believe that we need to take responsibility for the damage we are causing our planet. This is our only home, so we need to value it as well and treat it carefully. Pollution IS a very serious problem, probably more so than population control. Where do you think our waste goes? Sewage usually if not always ends up getting dumped into rivers and oceans. What about domestic trash? It ends up in landfills or incinerators (that cause air pollution from burning the waste). Even fertilizers used on farms is a source of pollution, because it gets into bodies of water and causes eutrophication. Even our energy sources (coal, natural gas, fossil fuels, oil, nuclear) creates waste that is considered detrimental. All of the waste we produce goes right back into the environment (nuclear waste is kind of an exception, as it gets stores in specific facilities, but nevertheless still the environment). If we increase our population, pollution will only increase unless we somehow revert to a more sustainable way of living.\n\nWhat ever happened to the subject of conservation? Responsible land practices? Now it is radical enviro-extremism. Aimed against the benefit of man.\n\nIf you do not want human life devalued, then you have to stand against any hint of human population \"control\". Every human life is of immense value and sacred.\n\nNeedless damage is being done, by evil NWO criminal elitists, and not so much by the common people. What is the point of fluoride poison in our water, GMO pollution in our food, and chem-trails in the air?\n\nI heard somewhere that trash costs around $30 per ton, to dispose of in a sanitary landfill. That is trivial compared to the sacred and immense value of a human life! Parent should not at all discount the great value of another human baby born into the world, due to such distractions as the 6000 disposable diaper that that child may use.\n\nNatural gas burns cleanly. Even propane burns quite clean. People have vent-free gas log sets that can even go into a fire box with no chimney, and gas stoves, that emit their products of combustion, straight into the room air. It is mostly just water vapor and carbon dioxide, what you yourself breath out.\n\nIf we increase in population, many people have good ideas of how to do stuff, and the technology increases, and we adapt to the increasingly population. It is win-win for everybody.\n\nYou also seem to conveniently forget, that world population is increasing as we speak. Perhaps we do not even have any choice about it - We will increase.\n\nI truly do believe that as more females are empowered, they will not be as pressured to marry so early and have children.\n\nAnd what if they want to marry early and to have more children?\n\nFemales will have more options as to what path they will follow, instead of seeing motherhood as inevitable.\n\nYet I read authors who say that feminism has messed it up to that men and women can't seem to get married anymore.\n\nMore and more females feel less obligated to have many children or commit to maternal duties exclusively, giving them freedom to choose how to live. Women can still choose to have as many children as they want, but it is becoming more common for them to choose other options or be satisfied with one or two children.\n\nAnd why the perverse social pressure to not have more than 2 children?\n\nAlso, more people does not necessarily benefit more people. I don't really see how that works?\n\nMore people are around to benefit. There is this philosophical concept of the Utilitarian Principle, that says that often the best thing to do is that which most benefits the most people. Even some website remarked about the population implications. If population rises, more people then benefit. Even it argues against any measures of population control, as the more populous we can become, the more people around to benefit.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Yosef MacGruber", "channel": "UCzvwk7CJXhK5ZkDGTAgrepA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRYcFOm9nLFP3j6ptujl4mSptz9DTFaF-Tz4UXI=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I am also not in the opinion that money is of greater value of children, what did I say to make you think that? I am simply saying that it is better to have less children if you cannot adequately provide for all of them... it is very sad for a family to realize that they have compromised their children's opportunities to get out of poverty because they had more children than they could support, or too many at one time. Not that they would actually regret having their children ( I doubt anyone would), they would only regret not being able to sufficiently provide for all them or making a better decision to wait until they could support more children. So yes, having children is a luxury in that sense. I recommend you read the book The Last Hunger Season by Roger Thurow.

We cut our hair, and females often shave or wax off their facial and body hair. This is all for the sake of convenience or appearance. Of course we would not cut off our legs and arms, that would be detrimental rather than convenient.

I don't think it is really anyone's place to be telling others how they should deal with their sex lives. If you don't like contraceptives, then you can simply choose not to use them. Governments may be promoting the use of contraceptives, but definitely not pushing people to use them! Where do you get that notion? It would be very helpful if you could please provide an example.\n\nI do not believe you understand the severity of environmental issues and how they relate to economic issues. What do you mean the subject of conservation? Conservation is the practice of setting aside land for wildlife, waste management is a different subject. What did I say that was extreme? That was mostly factual albeit general information. Also, dealing with climate change and other environmental issues that we are responsible for is not that simple. Even technology has a limit on what it can do. More people also means more resources necessary to provide for everyone. What do you think would happen if everyone in the world lived at the same standard of living people do in the US? We (most of the more developed countries) are already living very unsustainably and depleting our natural resources rapidly.

I would rather you not refer to religious resources, as those are your beliefs and I think we should keep this argument factual.\n\nWell then other people are wrong. Why should they promote immorality onto us, just because they pretend like they can ignore God's standards and invent phony standards that do not even work? If I take my car to a mechanic, and he makes my car worse rather than fixing it, why should I do business with that place anymore? If I pay taxes to a corrupt government that makes my country worse, why should I be okay about that? Just because some people claim to believe in Big Brother corrupt government?\n\nNo, you do not want to keep things factual, because you ignore the source of truth, the Bible. Let's be honest here.\n\nWhat people define as sexually immoral may be different from how you define it. It is not really your place to tell others how they should deal with their sex lives. Also, I still do not understand how sex education promotes \"immorality\" if it is only educational. Even if you think I am ignorant, it would be helpful if you clarify on what you mean.\n\nThen they are wrong. They should be corrected then. And they should stop spreading their lies. If I should not tell them how to do, then why should I as a taxpayer, pay for their nasty contraceptives? If they want to do their own stupid thing, can't they do that, while staying out of my wallet?\n\nI already explained that so many Sex Ed programs are immoral.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with a government recommending families to have less children if they are doing it to benefit the family overall...\n\nThe government is not my Daddy, nor the government my God. Do you not have any concept of limited government? Are you just an evil and stupid statist? Do you even know what that word, statist, means?\n\nHow are families benefited if they are deprived of their wondrous children?\n\nof course, families are not obligated to comply\n\nNot yet, supposedly, but evil depopulation agenda control freaks, are working on excuses to mandate compliance. Do you ever read any of those wacko elitist's writing or their stupid spoken claims?\n\nbut it truly is to benefit the family so that they can achieve a better standard of living.\n\nFalse economic theories and Mathusian theory assertions.\n\nI don't understand how that would be violating your religious beliefs or how it is promoting immorality...\n\nThe human seed is designed for growing more people. The Bible, the King James Version specifically, calls the semen, the \"seed of copulation\". Why is the very descriptive word \"seed\" used? Isn't the seed designed to be planted and to grow?\n\nIn the long list of supposed birth control \"options\", why is the most elegant and natural option that is possibly available, the \"no method\" method of so-called \"family planning\" so disrespected or even ignored? I call that extremely dishonest, and also very anti-choice. It shows that there is a very perverse agenda at work here.\n\nHaving fewer children does promote a better standard of living, due to the economic constraints of having children.\n\nThat is your opinion, and not at all supported by facts. Why don't you say something equally stupid, such as having a smaller house, or having fewer cars, does promote a better standard of living, due to economic blah-blah-blah? See what I did there? I exposed that you were assuming that having children is a bad investment of one's time, and that children are not a blessing. Some people might actually choose to have a smaller home or to not have a car if they live in a country with good transportation options, but those are mere material and optional things, that do not have the immense and sacred value, that children, or every human life, does have.\n\nAgain, for example, some parents may not be able to provide their children with adequate education for them to be able to get a job with a higher paying salary.\n\nSo that explains why nasty contraceptives were not even needed but a half century ago. Oh wait, it does not. Why has the society become so hostile against childbearing?\n\nWe wouldn't even need so much money, if it wasn't for all the government corruption, and its A through Z taxes. Yes, there really is an A through Z list out there. Do a search.\n\nNo one is pushing contraceptives on anyone,\n\nIgnorance is not an argument. Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, there are quotes out there, proving otherwise.\n\nthey are simply an option out there for those who do wish to use them.\n\nDriving off the embankment is simply an option out there for those who choose to kill themselves. Should we then remove guard rails from dangerous drops and from the sides of bridges? Why are you pushing for the crappy contraceptives? Why are you conveniently ignoring that huge numbers of people have objections to all methods of birth control?\n\nIf people don't wish to use them, then they are free not to.\n\n\"MAINTAIN HUMANITY UNDER 500,000,000 IN PERPETUAL BALANCE WITH NATURE\" -Georgia Guidestones\n\nPeople free to reject contraceptives? Well since the evil NWO plans to murder over 90% of the world population anyway?\n\nI am also not in the opinion that money is of greater value of children, what did I say to make you think that?\n\nDo you want the long list, or the short list? Well the long list would be obviously too long for me to list. Almost everything that you have said thus far.\n\nI am simply saying that it is better to have less children if you cannot adequately provide for all of them...\n\nSo do you hate other people's large families, and why?\n\nit is very sad for a family to realize that they have compromised their children's opportunities to get out of poverty because they had more children than they could support, or too many at one time.\n\nMalthusian assertions, yet Malthusian \"overpopulation\" dogma is false.\n\nYou are being negative against children, for no good reason.\n\nNot that they would actually regret having their children ( I doubt anyone would), they would only regret not being able to sufficiently provide for all them or making a better decision to wait until they could support more children.\n\nSo everybody should have but only 1 child, because that will somehow magically make them rich enough to give their children many 1000s of toys? Nobody in the world, should have to sleep in a bunk-bed or wear \"hand-me-down\" clothes? I have had used clothes, that were just fine, sometimes almost new.\n\nSo yes, having children is a luxury in that sense. I recommend you read the book The Last Hunger Season by Roger Thurow. It's really good!\n\nI doubt that that is an author who I want to read. Especially if somebody like you recommended it.\n\nHow does sex education encourage people to indulge in sex?\n\nSo you really have no idea what they promote in Sex Ed? Didn't I already describe some of it?\n\nI have never gotten that implication from any of my classes. It was simply educational. I do not believe I am being ignorant in any sense, so please explain what it is I am being ignorant of.\n\nI don't know so much, what kind of classes you had. But I suspect the the moral aspects and spiritual bonding of sexual relationships, were seriously downplayed, as that often is the case.\n\nDo you have a real question here, or are you feigning ignorance?\n\nWe clip our toenails and fingernails. We cut our hair, and females often shave or wax off their facial and body hair.\n\nI do not shave my body hair. Whatever for? It is not excessive, and it is self-limiting. To shave overly much, is not natural nor is it necessary. Facial and head hair, is another story, as that seem to grow out and out, if it is not occasional trimmed.\n\nThis is all for the sake of convenience or appearance. Of course we would not cut off our legs and arms, that would be detrimental rather than convenient. All contraceptives do is prevent sperm from contacting an egg,\n\nWhich aims to prevent actual real future people who would not want to have been prevented. Why do you keep insisting that humans should use contraceptives, when our ancestors thought otherwise? Were they wrong, or are we wrong today? What is wrong with a sperm contacting the egg? Birthing babies is just as natural and proper as eating, as breathing, as the heart beating. A vital life process.\n\nno one is being harmed,\n\nEven if nasty contraceptives are being rampantly pushed? Do you really see it as right, for pushy \"family planning\" workers to foist nasty contraceptives on other cultures, just trash their cultures, ignore their tradition preferences for large families, promote phony Western scarcity based upon false economic models, and outright Nazi eugenics and racism? If you want your eyes opened, then read the books, Killer Angel and Grand Illusions by George Grant. But you do not seem to even want to know the truth?\n\nso I don't see what is wrong with people using them.\n\nContraceptives damage and sabotage the human body, and aim to prevent the proper and natural growth and spread of human life.\n\nI don't think it is really anyone's place to be telling others how they should deal with their sex lives.\n\nWhy don't you tell the evil liberal-retards pushing their immoral Sex Ed, that claim?\n\nIf you don't like contraceptives, then you can simply choose not to use them.\n\nWell until large families come to be more persecuted, for supposedly contributing to \"overpopulation\", even though Malthusian \"overpopulation\" is not supported by science?\n\nGovernments may be promoting the use of contraceptives, but definitely not pushing people to use them!\n\nIgnorance is not an argument. China, India, etc. A cheap transistor radio for a man in India getting sterilized? Talk about cheap and disrespectful anti-family bribes? How insulting can those evil \"family planning\" pushers be?\n\nWhere do you get that notion? It would be very helpful if you could please provide an example.\n\nAm I your paid person tutor? Why are you so ill-informed? You can't google stuff where you live?\n\nI do not believe you understand the severity of environmental issues and how they relate to economic issues.\n\nI understand the claims. But I do not at all agree with them. Outright stupidity and lies.\n\nWhat do you mean the subject of conservation? Conservation is the practice of setting aside land for wildlife, waste management is a different subject.\n\nConservation is what they had, before the trendy enviro-extremism that has become so popular now.\n\nWhat did I say that was extreme?\n\nAlmost everything. You parrot garbage that I have heard and heard from the enviro-wackos, and you speak like a parrot, as if you don't even have a mind of your own to process all the errors in the extreme crap that you parrot.\n\nThat was mostly factual albeit general information. Also, dealing with climate change\n\nClimate change is bogus. The term should right away sound alarm bells. There are books out there exposing this stuff. I have several of them. You can tell it is bogus, by all the bogus names it has had so far. Why do they keep changing the name? Because people yawn, and say it is bogus, so the enviro-liars repackage the same old crap, slap another name on it, and yet the same old crap?\n\n• We were going to have another ice age.\n• The Greenhouse Effect\n• global warming\n• climate change\n\nI have a memory. I remember this stuff. Why don't you people? They say that if you are a liar, you have to have a good memory, otherwise your story changes, and you get caught in a lie. Yet the liar mad-scientists keep changing their story? I wonder what that might mean? Do I have to spell it out to you?\n\nand other environmental issues that we are responsible for is not that simple. Even technology has a limit on what it can do. More people also means more resources necessary to provide for everyone.\n\nAnd the problem with that is? God is not good for it? Producing more stuff creates more jobs to employ more people. The people need jobs, yes? They like reproducing? Well let them work jobs to support their families? Yet corrupt governments follow bogus stupid theories that destroy the economy and destroy their jobs? And then innocent babies are to blame? How?\n\nWhat do you think would happen if everyone in the world lived at the same standard of living people do in the US?\n\nYawn. Malthusian assertions again. I think it would be wonderful. The world should more modernize, as that would better support more people.\n\nWe (most of the more developed countries) are already living very unsustainably and depleting our natural resources rapidly.\n\n\"Unsustainably, or \"sustainable\" are bogus words, with no clear meaning, other than what the enviro-radicals deem that they mean. It is pretty much the religious-fanatical counterpart word to \"salvation\".\n\nMalthusian assertions again.\n\nEven now with such a high population so negatively impacting the environment, we have failed to \"adapt\". If we continue to negatively affect the environment, we will only negatively affect ourselves and others.\n\nSuch a high population, compared to what? Why do you think that world population is really so high? What makes it high? What is your yard-stick, or meter-stick if you prefer the metric system? Are people yet stacked high into the sky?\n\nWe would adapt far better, without so much corrupt government, and without the NWO rampant contraceptive pushing. I think the world was doing fairly well with accommodating rising populations, until the rampant contraceptive pushing, when then the rising numbers, hardly seemed important any more to accommodate. Now evil \"family planning\" pushers figuratively just toss nasty condoms into poor people's faces, like they do not even matter. And dysfunction corrupt governments of violence, seems to beget even more violence. As we can see in recent news stories.\n\nSo where are the complaints about how the NWO negatively affects the environment, with their fluoride poison in our water, chem-trails in the air, and GMO pollution in our food? And ever mind-rot crap on the TV?\n\nIf a woman want to get married early and have a large family, that's fine.\n\nWell I am glad that you finally concede that. For quite some time, you seem hostile against large families, or the very idea that huge numbers of people have objections to all methods of birth control.\n\nIt's their choice, ultimately, but females should never be pressured into a certain lifestyle, especially if they wish to pursue another kind.\n\nSo people should never be pressured to use any means of birth control? Is that what you could be saying here?\n\nAlso, in the past, women married mainly out of duty and because it was really their only option. Now women can go and do other things. I do not understand how feminism prevents men and women from being married if that is what a couple wants. Feminism promotes gender equality, since women are often given the shorthand in many cases compared to men.\n\nAnd people are leaving Babylon America, and one reason that some cite, is that they can't get married. Feminism has ruined it for both men and women. Well one author I read, claimed that feminism has ruined it for people getting married in America. He says if you stay in America, you end up incel, which means involuntary celibate.\n\nThere is no social pressure to not have more than two children, what are you referring to?\n\nPeople just about think you are really strange, if you have 5 children. They look at you all funny. \"Are they all yours?\" \"Are you Catholic?\" What is so hard to understand, that some people love children, and see no need for birth control?\n\nRaising children is a very difficult (not to mention expensive) task,\n\nWell who didn't know that already? Is that the sort of crap they teach now in Sex Ed?\n\nespecially if the mother is pursuing a career,\n\nMany women think that being a stay-at-home Mom is a virtue, and many families are trying to get their finances so that Mom can stay home with the children. Before the Industrial Revolution, families had Dads also, and often the family would work together.\n\nso most females feel satisfied with having only one or two children as they aren't being pressured to have more anymore.\n\nAnd that is largely why the West is dying, and Asia and Africa and Hispanics are taking over.

Natural resources are means of exchange for us to survive, if you truly believe that the real economy is water, livestock, vegetation, arable soil, you are suggesting us to go back to stone age and live in the wild world. That might be nice, but kills a lot of people. I don't know how those extreme environmentalists think its moral as human being to think that. Look, you probably think I'm a dirty capitalist just by tackling you, but you must see what is happening in the world, and I highly doubt you and I will not be able to comprehend everything whats happening in the world as we speak. \n\nMy country \"South Korea\" is covered with more than 70% of forest and once we've lost all of forest during the war. But right after the war, people started planting trees and recycle garbage voluntarily, and it was very successful. We recovered most of the forest and we drink much clean water than other Asian countries, all those might not have been possible if we didn't accept the system which you call it \"The monetary structured ill minds\"  or \"False Money\". Our economy grew with industry and eco system together, we developed technology to purify the water most efficiently by borrowing money from global credit system and people imported seeds from other countries to plant trees from nothing by borrowing money from other creditors. This is the most productive way in which our humanity has adopted, and you think it is purely evil?. Do you know that Tesla makes electric cars by borrowing from false economy ?, they make no profit and burning down the cash every quarters, and yet they are still surviving. if we had no credit based system, companies like Tesla will have no chance to survive. \n\nEveryone on earth wish to have clean air and water, no fools want to drink dirty water. So people do actually work to protect the nature. But what is really annoying me is that after all these Climate change projections from IPCC and other institutions constantly fail to prove their theory (Man-made climate change). They are still supporting this idea, no true scientists make such claims which they can't prove. This is not something we can simply believe its happening, its science, you cant put a faith in science, it is not a religion. Also what those man-made climate change perpetrators do not look into is the history of our own planet. There were times of extremely hot and cold even before the existence of human being, I think it is arrogant to think that we are the sole cause and can control the mother nature. Its the same thing as to those who believed the earth is flat. I will not trust any one of those people who say they believe in Climate change until scientists find out what is really driving our climate system.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Maple Game", "channel": "UC0axN14MN_evH_fmrPOcXjQ", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZYFQMeAgzwaFQSO4on0kQHtQHLjIM3sL-P5n6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The fact is, if corporations control all of the means of production, what are we as consumers to turn to? That's exactly the point.

Corporations control the united states congress. There is no alternative for people to choose from be them you or me, or the government for that matter. Which leads to the very insane idea that global climate change is not man made. In fact there has been a lot of backlash against that idea, even by politicians. go ahead and look into the people funding ads and politicians that attempt to disprove global climate change, or use talking points to attempt to change the american publics mind. The ones with money behind them are bought by big oil, the ones like you are just perpetuating talking points derived from a BP think tank. There is no feasible alternative to oil because corporations buy elections in this country. Your bullshit rhetoric about being a hypocrite makes no logical sense. You're advocating that you won't be a hypocrite at the same time hinting that you're okay with the demise of the human race. Insane. Quite literally insane. For instance, did you know that over 80% of NRA members want universal background checks. In fact people I know whom own guns, including myself, advocate for more gun laws. Does that make us a hypocrite? Sure. Does that make us wrong? No. Advocating for what is right doesn't mean it can't be hypocritical. And again, People don't have other alternatives to cars because this is what the corporations have created. In seattle where I live for instance. There is only 1 light rail, with about 5 stops to downtown seattle, only going one way, busses are slow and unreliable, the only option that people in seattle have is to sit in traffic for hours on end, there are very few other alternatives to buying cars and using oil. If companies offered cars or transportation that was reliable that didn't use fossil fuels, and I still opted to use fossil fuels, then the title of hypocrite would be justified, seeing how there is no other alternative, your point is moot.

However, could this possibly be the fact this planet is not static.  In the sense that nothing well ever remain the same?  I mean you are concerned about flooding areas.  Meanwhile other areas have record droughts, find it hard to believe this would occur with catastrophic melting of the ocean ice.  I really think you need to come to grips with the reality things are changing on this planet all the time.  Where I live now used to be covered with water millions of years ago.  Hate to break it to you but cars weren't running around then.   I am not going to name any names, but a strong voice in \"global warming\" movement.  Predicted the Arctic ice caps would disappear by 2014.  That time has since come and gone. and amazingly we are all still alive and doing great!", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "DaddyDubs", "channel": "UCaD0Xd9qr9NTAB8QGj5TCdg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTibW-dZziZhcFY6CSYlAJ0wBxSPkPVpVbjyBOX5Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Everything they discover, they do not use it to change, they use it to reinforce their stupidity. \n\nThe thing that amazes me is how many people have no idea the Co2 Alarmist Scientists have been around from the 1800's. That is over 100 years of them trying to make Co2 an issue. They change their projections every 10 to 20 years. They have been wrong for over 100 years. You would think they would just admit they are wrong and get on with real science.\n\nI do not have an issue with the general public who are temporarily fooled by them. It is the scientists who fall for it. They abandon science to follow the Co2 nuts. This is no joke, the 1800's and they are still wrong. I was born in 1966 and they were chanting we would be in an ice age in 10 or 20 years. Then, instead of saying they were wrong, they would just re-crunch the numbers and say 10 or 20 years.\n\nThe fact is, the earth has micro cycles and macro cycles. They are 24 hour, 3 month, 1 year, 10 year, 100 year, 1,000 year, 10,000 year, 100,000 year cycles. You can look at the 500,000 or the 300,000 year Earth Mean Temperature Cycle Graph and see them. They ignore them and follow the false models. \n\nTheir false models back before computers, was because they would alter data, leave out data and use bad calculations to get their models. Now they have computers and they alter data, ignore data and the computer does bad calculations. The calculations are bad, because the data is not complete.\n\nIf you look at the models in 1998 and compare what actually happened to 2010, you see they were way off. Then look at their computer models each 4 years, for the last 8 and compare it to what is now in 2017, they are way off. Instead of stopping the bad practice, they alter their projections downward for short term, but their long term projections keeps that false hockey Stick Graph.\n\nIf you take the actual data on the earth mean temperatures, from the last 15,000 years, copy it, reverse it and then you will have a more accurate projection of the next 15,000 years. I am not saying  to flip it from top to bottom. I am saying switch it so the graph that is showing 15,000 years ago, is now showing 15,000 years into the future.\n\nThe earth is at a 1,000 year, 10,000 year and 100,000 year high, all three at the same time. You see it in the 300,000 and the 500,000 year Earth Mean Temperature Graph. If for millions of years, you see that pattern, you know it is going to repeat. Co2 is about 400 ppm. In the past is was 1,000 ppm with primates alive on the earth. Navy personnel and astronauts are routinely exposed to 600 ppm with no side effects.\n\nThey ignore all these facts. Including that Co2 was higher in the past, yet it was cooler. Also Co2 was lower in the past and it was warmer. Co2 has been going up in the past and the earth mean temperature was going down. Co2 was going down in the past and the earth mean temperature was going up. They ignore these facts. Because they leave out this data, their computer models are false and that is why they keep getting it wrong.\n\nHere is a past Earth Mean Temperature Graph. Now lay a ruler or piece of paper up to your screen and put it at the top highest point in the present day data on the graph. You will see the past 100,000 year highs are higher than it is today. Yet they would have you believe that we are in the highest temperatures in recorded history. Clearly you can see it was warmer in the past. Look at the Co2 record for the last 500,000 years and you will see the Co2 was higher in the past. Humans did not do that, they were not even on the planet then.\n\nThey are wrong. The sad thing is they keep trying, even after 100 years of being wrong and they are scaring people for no good reason. The next 100,000 years, will be similar to any one of the 100,000 year cycles of the past. Co2 is less than 8% of the Greenhouse Effect and humans are only 5% of that Co2 figure. They know Water Vapor is the Major Contributing Factor to the Greenhouse effect. They leave water vapor out and only talk about the other Greenhouse Gases. That is Deceptive Science.

{"cid": "UgjilFHe-AFkhHgCoAEC.82E1Y7KegBN8VI5-xgZp4X", "text": "+Fla-bushcraft Prepper  The problem is you are going out of your way to obfuscate the information, then blaming stupid people.  You are selecting for people who are heavily invested in your message being true, and do not realize you are giving off red flags that you don't know what you're talking about or are lying profusely.  Searching for the agenda-specific keywords you either intentionally or ignorantly provide means they get search results from your camp that display your narrative: this is not how real research is done, and will lead you awry and into fake news every time.  This is the nature of any popularly controversial topic; if you have no experience with how to search properly, you will just feed yourself into the hype machine.\n\nThe fact that scientists have been wrong in the past is not surprising or evidence in favour of one theory over another; if you will only believe in those who are never wrong, you aren't looking for science you're looking for prophets and religious dogma (\"oh, he was wrong? false prophet.  he wasn't real therefore his clear failure doesn't impact the credibility of real prophets\").  That's the nature of trying to learn about the world.  Science is not about absolute belief that the current science is true no matter what because we say so, but rather that it is the best information that we have at the time.  This is where personal verification comes in; and you don't check something controversial properly by searching one-sided dogmatic keywords like \"gender spectrum explained\" or \"why we know ghosts are real\".  You have to actually learn about the issues at hand.  It is actually easier to simply lap up keywords by someone like you, speaking authoritatively and conspiratorially while being extremely vague about verifiable facts that work against them and yet very specific about others parts of their story that will funnel you to articles that come from their social microcosm and reinforce their beliefs.  So your argument that you speak the way you do because you don't like to teach stupid people, is actually a hollow excuse; your words are those of a propagandist (intentional or not), not a guide to verifiable truth.\n\nTo really research global warming for yourself you need to investigate in order to understand a lot of things: what is being claimed in the \"dominant narrative\", whether you believe it or not; what argumentation this narrative gives as evidence, and how valid it is; what premises this argumentation works from, and if they are supported by the data; what data these premises use as a basis, and how various instances of it are collected; and whether in the big picture these all make sense with each other and with science in general.  On top of that, you need to have a firm grasp of basic science and how to learn, as well as how to discern trustworthy information and sound arguments from garbage.  Being able to discern the motives of people you are communicating with is very important here, as well as being able to discern your own motives when communicating.  So it is not surprising that many people are not knowledgeable or or virtuous or tenacious enough to research an issue adequately.\n\nThe fact that your comment is clearly copy-pasted (makes references to graphs that aren't) shows your low personal level of learning, lack of mastery of your arguments, and your very low care for the actual (not claimed) truth of what you say.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "xandercorp", "channel": "UCa6cUsBlECJaqMsd1sS4ZlQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSElhHXd7TDWraVhgc59HjNOEcJzo0eDdfdrA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjgvRI2mfyoNXgCoAEC", "text": "Abundant means sufficient to meet needs. In this way, there is ample supply of all atmospheric gas, and thus they are equally abundant.\n\nEquilibrium means the intake and discharge of oxygen and carbon dioxide by organisms; the most abundant gas, nitrogen is neutral and serves as the pavement, the foundation and the footings of Earth's atmosphere. Increases in oxygen result from plant growth, which consume carbon dioxide to do so. Carbon dioxide is liberated into the atmosphere from many sources, principally biological decay and combustion. Carbon dioxide is created from the decay of carbon monoxide, a direct result of combustion. Hydrocarbon combustion in vehicles is converted to dioxide quickly in the emissions phase, eliminating the short, several hour span of monoxide and harmful effects. The great majority of hydrocarbon combustion conducted for heat production on Earth is but a fraction of the carbon dioxide output that occurs. \n\nCarbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has not increased forty percent on Earth, as suggested. Spot measurements on the surface might reveal this figure; there are other factors not considered as they are not measured and unable to be measured, at this point.\n\nHuman technology does not measure the total volume of Earth's atmosphere; it is not static. Also not measured is the difference in concentrations at altitude. There is not a homogeneous mixture of Earth atmosphere gases; carbon dioxide is heavier than the two atom oxygen molecule and shows higher concentrations closer to the surface.\n\nHumans measure concentrations in more densely populated areas, where human use of fuels increases the concentration temporarily.

{"cid": "Ught5SY3QIWkD3gCoAEC", "text": "Abundant means sufficient to meet needs. In this way, there is ample supply of all atmospheric gas, and thus they are equally abundant.\n\nEquilibrium means the intake and discharge of oxygen and carbon dioxide by organisms; the most abundant gas, nitrogen is neutral and serves as the pavement, the foundation and the footings of Earth's atmosphere. Increases in oxygen result from plant growth, which consume carbon dioxide to do so. Carbon dioxide is liberated into the atmosphere from many sources, principally biological decay and combustion. Carbon dioxide is created from the decay of carbon monoxide, a direct result of combustion. Hydrocarbon combustion in vehicles is converted to dioxide quickly in the emissions phase, eliminating the short, several hour span of monoxide and harmful effects. The great majority of hydrocarbon combustion conducted for heat production on Earth is but a fraction of the carbon dioxide output that occurs. \n\nCarbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has not increased forty percent on Earth, as suggested. Spot measurements on the surface might reveal this figure; there are other factors not considered as they are not measured and unable to be measured, at this point.\n\nHuman technology does not measure the total volume of Earth's atmosphere; it is not static. Also not measured is the difference in concentrations at altitude. There is not a homogeneous mixture of Earth atmosphere gases; carbon dioxide is heavier than the two atom oxygen molecule and shows higher concentrations closer to the surface.\n\nHumans measure concentrations in more densely populated areas, where human use of fuels increases the concentration temporarily. Long term study and analysis of gaseous concentrations far from human populations and activities, such as across vast, un-populated land masses and over oceans and at altitudes above these locations, across Earth's surface, would reveal differences not considered now.\n\nThe percentage increases and declines in oxygen and carbon dioxide are indeed much different, because the base amounts are so different.
