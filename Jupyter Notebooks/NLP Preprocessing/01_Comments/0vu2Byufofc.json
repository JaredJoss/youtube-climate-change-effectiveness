This earth, the things above earth(the moon, the sun, and the stars will all perish away). The things under the earth and in the seas will all perish away. The things on earth will also perish away. We will also perish away, if we do not know and accept Christ as our Lord and Savior. Because all of us were born into sin, and we also inherited the curse of sin, and inherited the sin nature.\nDid you know that only Christ can give us Salvation, eternal life, and forgiveness of Sin? \nThere will be a new earth coming down from Heaven, this new earth is called, The New Jerusalem. Let us all desire to be there. But only those who belong to Jesus will be there, and live together there with Him. We shall be His children, His people, and He shall be our Lord, to the Glory of God. Amen!\n\nDo you have questions about who Jesus is? Ok, I will tell you.\n\nDid you know that God created the heavens and the earth, and the seas and everything in them with His Word?\nDid you know that Christ is that Word in which all things were created?\nDid you know that God created this earth and everything in it through Jesus (who is The Word Of God) and by Jesus Christ all things were created? Did you know that all things   were created by Jesus, and for Jesus? Amen! To the glory of God.\n\nIf you are confused about who Christ Jesus is, please read this. Thank you!\n\nActs chapter 4 verse 12: \"There is no salvation through anyone else, nor is there any other name under heaven given to the human race by which we are to be saved.\"\n\nYeshua Ha Massiach\n\nWho is Christ? Who is Jesus?\n\nJesus, the Christ, is God's word made flesh. Jesus is Jehovah God's (The Creator's) Word made into flesh.\n\n1 John chapter 5 verse 7: \" For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.\"\n\nJohn chapter 1 verse 1: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n\nJohn chapter 1 verse 14: \" And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"\n\nJohn chapter 1 verse 10: \" He was in the world, and the world¬† knew Him not.\"\n\nHebrews chapter 4 verse 12: \" For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\"\n\nHow beautiful and awesome is God's Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Magnificent in all His glory, is He.\n\nAmen!\n\nJohn's Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven:\n\nRevelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3: \" Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.\"\n\nWhy did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us?\n\nChrist (God's Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam's flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh(Jesus Christ's flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death¬† shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell.\n\nChrist, who is God's Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions.\n\nChrist died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,¬† Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power(God). Through Christ's sacrifice we gain Salvation through God's abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus.\n\nJohn chapter 3 verse 16: \" For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that who ever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\"\n\nRomans chapter 5 verse 8: \" But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"\n\nChrist came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam.\n\nDeath in Adam, Life In Christ:\n\nRomans chapter 5 verse 19: \" For as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so also by one Man's obedience, many will be made righteous.\"\n\nRomans chapter 5 verse 18: \" Therefore, as through one man's (Adam's) offense judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man's (Christ's) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.\"\n\nRomans chapter 5 verse 17: \" For if by the one man's offense(Adam's offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One(Jesus Christ).\n\nRomans chapter 5 verse 12: \" Therefore, just as through one man (Adam)sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.\"\n\nRomans chapter 5 verse 21: \" \"So that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"\n\n¬†Do you now see that through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it abundantly? Yes Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation.\n\nAdam's flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation.\n\nChrist's sacrifice, the crucifixtion¬† of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, life, resurrection, eternal life, salvation\n\nChrist is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, waring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all. Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Hallelujah!\n\nRevelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: \" And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. \"\n\nNow do you see friends, Why Christ Jesus is so so Important for our Salvation? Yes.\n\nNow, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus,only? Yes.\n\nChrist is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men(us humans).\n\nGod loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God's Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us.\n\nWill you accept Christ and be saved?\n\nRomans chapter 6 verse 23: \"¬† For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"\n\nJohn Chapter 3 verse 16: \" For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that who ever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.\"\n\nSalvation is free!\n\nSalvation is free!\n\nChrist already paid the price, all you have to do is recieve salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach.\n\nSo who is Christ?\n\nHe is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the unseen God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life.\n\nAmen!\n\nI love you Lord!\n\nJohn chapter 14 verse 6: \" Jesus said to him,\" I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"\n\nColassians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16:\nHe is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.\"\n\nJohn chapter 1 verse 1 to 4:\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with¬†God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.\"\n\nI hope that you know Christ, and understand Christ better now,to the glory of God.\n\nAmen!\n\nChrist is for all who will receive Him.\n\nRepent of your sins.\nSubmit to Jehovah-God.\nLove God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.\nLove one another.\nForgive one another.\nIt is written, that if you \"resist the devil, and submit to God, then devil will flee from you.\"\nHate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.\n\nShare the gospel of Christ with others.\nTo the glory\n\nPlease don't delete this comment.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Ann Myann", "channel": "UCoS1l-r9AJnyz-c3dTyiLrA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ8t2BvhWtbyHLMCqZ0hF1NQjb_vBceGW5-rw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzQ61Xo_kt3Ga5sh094AaABAg", "text": "Just a fair warning: David Keith is bad news. He's THE major proponent of geoengineering, which is heavily pushed by billionaires but the science shows any benefits would be negligible, while the risks are enormous. Carbon sequestration and reduction of emissions are both extremely necessary, and spraying aerosols in the sky to enact \"radiative forcing\" to force away the sun's rays is ludicrous. No one serious/ respected will actually push geoengineering. Keith does scholarship on carbon capture; I'm not saying his work is 100% bad, but the bad stuff is SERIOUSLY bad. \n\nAND BOOM AT 20:30 he talks about it. This makes me sick. \"Wacky, controversial\"... Yes. I saw David Keith speak in person in 2013. He said, in front of an audience (and this is recorded) that \"geoengineering will kill people.\" This is not \"wacky/controversial,\" this is a gross, seriously concerning experiment that must not be allowed to happen when there are SO MANY OTHER KNOWN OPTIONS AVAILABLE. Yes, plant trees!!! Sequester carbon in the VAST swaths of agricultural land that exist!!! Scientists already posit that the Earth could be returned to pre-industrial carbon levels in 50 years by raising the humus content of the soil (read Terra Preta by Ute Shueb et al.). We do NOT need geoengineering. We do NOT, under ANY circumstances, need to use technology to kill people to \"solve climate change.\" \n\nThis is GARBAGE. DO NOT PUSH GEOENGINEERING ON YOUR CHANNEL. Listen to scientists that don't describe themselves as \"in Bill Gates' kitchen cabinet,\" as Keith did when I saw him in-person in 2013. Billionaires do not care about the people. 80% of the world's biodiversity is on 22% of the land, and this land happens to be legally controlled by Indigenous peoples. One of the best things people can do for climate change is return Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous land control. The solutions exist.

The world we live in is built on balance. That's why the earth doesn't die when there's a volcano. Everything eventually works itself out. \n\nBoom humans came along, cutting down what once sucked up carbon. Burning down trees releases the once held carbon back into the atmosphere. Cattle farms as far as the eye can see in Brazil pumping methane into the atmosphere. Oil sands in the Arctic turning the once rich soil in infertile sludge and the water toxic. And all for what, short term profit, because humans don't give time for things to balance out. They just take and take, poisoning the soil, water and air. It's quite sad actually. Coral reefs are calcifying from acidic waters and rising sea levels, so now small islands inhabited by people are flooding. \n\nCarbon and other pollutants trap heat within the atmosphere, pollutants which would go away if we stop destroying so much of what is keeping the balance.

You pretty much get all you need from grains, vegetables and nuts if you incorporate a good amount of those into your diet. But it's a whole other thing if you're trying to gain muscle mass or lose weight, of course, because in those instances you should try to get a lot more protein than the basic recommended amount. Fat is also super easy to get from nuts or oils, so you wouldn't necessarily need eggs or fish for that either. But yeah, those are just some \"cool food facts\".

I was just diagnosed with it a couple months ago. What it is, is a medical condition in which an individual develops an abnormal pain reflex. This overactive reflex causes constriction of blood vessels which deprives oxygen to muscles, bones and skin causing lactic acid build-up. Most people don't usually see someone who is able to correctly diagnose this because it usually occurs in younger people (teens and children mostly) and their parents think their child is faking it for attention just because the usual visual scans can't recognize it.

It‚Äôs one of the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù geoengineering methods as it‚Äôs using afforestation (greening areas that haven‚Äôt been green for years/decades) and reducing deforestation which can help to remove some extra CO2 from the atmosphere. What‚Äôs important to note is that we can‚Äôt just have one method to use, but rather use several methods together. \n\nCarbon Fixation is probably one of the cleaner carbon removal methods I‚Äôve learnt about, but sadly none that I‚Äôve come across from what I remember (I‚Äôll come back if I remember one) have been shown to be cost effective on a large scale as yet. \n\nAgain, I‚Äôm merely a student of climate so please don‚Äôt take my words as absolute. I‚Äôd highly recommend having a look at the Assessment Report 5: Summary for Policy Makers from the UN which covers this type of information (and much more) and is considered the most authoritative source on Climate Change.

Companies generate their millions/billions from the extraction, sale and distribution of these resources. Countries such as China are DEPENDANT on coal. \n\nHumanity in our ignorance have revolved too many of our core systems around the usage of these resources. We should be solving the problems but clearly our priorities are elsewhere, the businesses want to keep making profit and countries want to continue existing without crippling themselves after all. Its a real conundrum, I guess its a matter of time before things really go to sh** and when that times come I wonder what desperate measures will be taken and how foolish we will view ourselves...\n\nFrom what I have heard we have already done a lot of damage for the future, how effectively we act now is all about damage mitigation nothing more, that is how bad it is already. This is going to blow up in our face so its up to us to take as many (or few) steps back from the bomb that we primed ourselves.\n\nWe (countries) are so good at talking about what the issues are, and boasting about small victories but in the grand scheme of things we still are not doing enough, and since the health of the only habitable planet we can reach is concerned - we should be freaking out a lot more! we should be trying a lot harder. \n\nBut the degradation is insidious enough to give us the liberty of doing little and feeling content or bickering amongst ourselves. Its so funny.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see the response of the world when things get really bad. And just like with smokers disease (COPD) its not going to be sudden, its going to be progressive, stage to stage. It's during the mid-latter stages, when we come to realise how much our planet has deteriorated compared to now - then the fear will properly sink into our minds and hearts, and the realisation of how we wilfully contributed to the withering of our planet will permeate through our societies. Because by then the differences should be so obvious that no one doubts anymore.\n\nSo now the question is, what value is on that bomb timer?", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "E", "channel": "UCQ_8jeLmV6Qw4MNVC9G4rOw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRWRcehedUZfwRh8Mk60GexPybgzMa71YctF-F1bw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This stable climate allowed cities to be built along coasts, allowed farms to keep being productive for generations to feed those cities, and let people prepare for the worst-case scenario floods, storms, droughts, and so on. Stable climate was what allowed civilization to emerge and sustain themselves.\n \nFor the next 7000 years, the second half of human civilization, we won't have the luxury of a stable climate. If we continue along the path most models predict we're on today, the temperature of the Earth won't return to normal for several millennia. We can't live along coastlines any more because the sea will keep incrementally rising for centuries, encroaching on and eventually overwhelming flood defenses. Things that used to occur only once in 100 years, like massive droughts or storms that destroy the food supply of whole countries, will happen practically every year. By 2100 African wheat crops will be decreased by 70% by events like this. But the problem doesn't stop at 2100, it only gets worse. We'll eventually stop emitting CO2, but the climate will keep warming for hundreds to thousands of years depending on when we finally bring our emissions under control.\n\nYou can count on one hand the number of times in the history of life on Earth that the climate has changed as rapidly as it's changing now. And every single time that it's happened, the majority of life has gone extinct. In geologic time, what we're doing to the world is of the same speed and magnitude as the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.  \n\nThe magnitude of human misery caused by climate change will increase exponentially the longer it takes for us to bring our emissions to zero. If we start acting RIGHT NOW, with unrelenting pressure on our politicians to sustain the effort, investing literally most of the world's GDP towards solving this problem, we could bring global emissions under control fast enough for this bump in temperatures to only last a century or two. If we don't, the bump will last thousands of years. We have the chance in the next TEN years to control what the climate of the Earth will look like for the next TEN THOUSAND years - and we're letting it slip by.\n\nOne more thing - The idea that America doesn't need to curb its emissions because it's only a small part of the global problem MISSES THE POINT. America has a responsibility NOT ONLY to invest the trillions of dollars it'll take to decarbonize its economy immediately (this is the BARE MINIMUM is should do) but ALSO to invest the trillions of dollars it'll take to get the developing world to decarbonize and adapt to climate change. Our country has been exploiting the cheap labor and natural resources of developing countries for its whole history, from the slave trade to the modern globalized economy. We have a moral responsibility to protect the citizens of those countries, who will feel the greatest effects of climate change because of where they're geographically located, but whose governments are least capable of preventing or preparing for it. Since our country is the greatest contributor to climate change when you sum emissions across history, the deaths of people in the third world at the hands of climate change is our responsibility.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Isaac Metcalf", "channel": "UCHwTJSHPMzfb6pCNCwKucOg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSUq2rRchHSiFhvftY9AB6SRY71mo1xi3RjhRU3iQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwL09iy76NHbBzxu614AaABAg", "text": "I know that i am going to probably sound like an ignorant, but i think that climate change doesn't exist and even it does then definitely not becouse CO2 since carbon dioxide is heavier than air and the hightest concentration of it that we can find is near to ground and I supose that means green house effect doesn't work by retaining infrared light under the layer of CO2 becouse it's not up in the sky, it'son the ground. although i don't negate global warming becouse i heard a lot about earths pole shift. They had shiftedand probably still are shifting, although that doesn't spell doom to mankind but definitely inconveniences. With Magnetic poles shifted earth started to rotate around a different axis meaning that there will be hotter but only incertain parts of the globe like North America Europe or Australia. From that can be deduced that average temperature of the earth is the same and i still don't think it is but that's becouse of a hydrogen cloud that our solar systeem is flying through. Besides there was an eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano in 2010 that released at least as much CO2 into the atmosphere as we did throughout our entire existence and yet, global warming wasn't that aparent back then.  Also i have a lot of questions about geoengeneering like, is lowering atmosphere temperature worth compare to potentialy toxick efects of altered atmosphear in yet another way. About internal combustion engines I'm not exactly keen on them but not becouse of CO2, rather nitrous oxides that when mixed with water become acids and unburned carbon hydrates that are not that good to our lungs. I agree that that's not majority of exhaust gasses and actually i am not that keen on electrick cars either becouse of toxick batery chemistry that can be even more poisonous to environment than interna combustion engines. Although i am begining to be tilted to electrick becouse of recent batery chemistry alterations, not to mention efficiency of the electrick engine, torque output making clutches and gearboxes absolete and reducing number of moving parts leading to more reliable vehicle. Now, if you read this to the end i would like to thank you for your attention as you are the pearson that doesn't take shortcuts and i believe you are the person that will actually make difference in this world.\r\nP.S.\r\nIf you think that I said something wrong, I am very much welcom for a criticque", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "man man", "channel": "UCFVkd6rIaJFrb5Rs3gZt8Ww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSZk4c--ghuriaLK4ZXdm9yl3wLBU2dmMDqVA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Even if you can't go vegan or vegetarian, reducing and being mindful of what you consume is always the first step.

{"cid": "Ugy04EwpXGDNQfMfkwR4AaABAg", "text": "Geoengineering is not good for several reasons. (Let me clarify that I am no expert, and I have only loosely researched this)\n1. The idea of putting aerosols into the atmosphere to fight climate change falls directly under the category of the God-Species complex, this idea that humans are above the earth/against it, instead of being part of it. \"it is us vs. the world/climate change\" when in actuality it's us vs. ourselves. Just like said in the video this is just a substitute. It will not only sound but is like we are challenging and finding ways around climate change instead of stopping it at its root. No more excuses.\n\n2.  This is incredibly dangerous politically. We can't regionalize these aerosols, we put them in, and they will eventually equalize over the whole earth to do their job being: cool us down. But if we want to put something this big into the atmosphere that affects every single country, we'd have to come to an agreement with every single government (which we have never seen before). Let's say Russia wants us to put a minimal amount into the atmosphere so that it's not as cold, and suddenly there will be much more livable space without snow, room for agriculture and housing. But then on the other side, we have someplace like Egypt who wants to put a lot of lot more into the air, so it is colder, thus allowing them to have more livable locations that don't cause intense overheating problems. And then we have the tiny, tiny, tiny countries that would not even get a say in the matter and are ultimately left to watch as the big countries fill their own agendas, and now these small ones are in danger of climate shock.\n\n3. Climate Shock is when you do just this, deliberately mess with the climate to make it what you want, it would cool us down and make an artificial cooling system. But let's say something goes wrong, and suddenly everything starts to revert back to before the aerosols are in the air! We would feel the effects of all the climate change we have been experiencing for the last few decades, but this time all at once. It would induce climate shock to way too many environments and species, which would kill them quite fast because they never had any time to adjust.\n\nUltimately I do not think messing with our atmosphere is for the best. I think it's a cheap excuse to get around the root of the problem, which is that we should stop spitting CO2 out. Remember when the Blue Marvel came out? (that famous picture of the earth) the people who published it thought it would make us all feel so small and fragile. \"Wow, look, we really are just some specs in the universe,\" and it did! but for the MOST part, it did the opposite and enforced the idea that we are in control of the world, and we as humans are on top instead of a part of. I strongly feel this is a bad idea.", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "E Lariz", "channel": "UCBc6lE9hXe-l7OMfctJCybw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRrbG3ims2hnbz4l79juSGCm9pq-oVkaqRo2Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Like in Finland, the distances are huge and people commute a long way to get to work and school.

I currently live in the city center, so biking to work is much easier and cheaper than having to get a car. And one day when I buy a house, I'll probably keep biking to work anyway, because I enjoy it and it keeps me healthy. And in the winter when it gets too dangerous to bike, there's also a great public transport network with buses, trains and trams that I'll use.\n\nAnd because Finland is such a \"new\" country, even younger than the US, our cities were initially built for cars, too. But that's not an excuse, and many cities here have been restructured to favor cyclists and pedestrians. In my city it's not allowed to drive a car through the center anymore.

The economy wants money, and so if the consumers put their money towards more green initiatives, the economy will have to follow. \nüåπ Things you can do almost right now\n- Eat less meat\n- Use recycled paper/fountain pen\n- Buy secondhand clothes/furniture\n- Grow your own vegetables\n- Get a menstrual cup (only if you feel comfortable enough to do so!)\n- Consume less in general (you create less waste this way)\n- Use public transport/carpool/ride your bike (less CO2 emissions)\n- Be conscious about what you're buying (do you really need it? Will you actually use it?)\n- Buy as many things without packaging (water, vegetables, fruits)\n- Use reusables you will actually use to their full extent (water bottle, lunch box, thermos, reusable bag)\n- Buy food as local as you can (if there are apples from across seas or from your country, choose the ones from your country!)\n- Ebooks instead of paper books (rip dark academia aesthetic)/secondhand books (yes dark academia aesthetic)\n- When you're done with something, find a more sustainable alternative (more natural shampoo, less packaged mascara, basically anything skin/hair/selfcare, choosing wooden brushes over plastic ones)\n- Be cautious of microplastics (they get in the sea and destroy ecosystems)\n(Will add more as suggestions come!)\nüåπ Also: don't give up anything you love for sustainability. Try to make sustainability fit into your life, not your life into sustainability. \n\"You can't do all the good the world needs, but the world needs all the good you can do.\" Quote from Shelby here on YouTube (great source with very accessible information!).

Yes some species of animals will likely go extinct, but most will adapt, as they have for the past 800 million years in order to survive. I‚Äôm not denying that we have altered our climate dramatically and that we should do all we can to decrease our carbon footprint and lower carbon emissions, (estimates say we have prolonged this ‚Äòinter glacial period‚Äô by 50,000 years) we need to get rid of the idea that the earth will turn into a barren rock akin to Mars, if we don‚Äôt do something.

Of course an individual acting ethically in regards to the environment is a good thing, but the issue of climate change especially must be addressed on a systemic level. The narrative seems to be that you, your mum, and the nice grandpa who feeds stray dogs down the street are, as part of society, to blame for climate change, and thus also have the responsibility to fix it, but the things that cause most of the emissions are actually caused by massive industries controlled by unfathomably wealthy sociopaths who own lawmakers and administrators. Many of these problems cannot simply be changed by a widespread change in consumer behaviour, and many are happening in spite of it, such as continued subsidies for fossil fuels often being the only reason they are competitive in the energy market in many places. The political will to fight climate change is there, as is the sense of urgency associated with, the problem is that the aristocracy does not agree.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "TheBurgerkrieg", "channel": "UCIWD1MzoJTPt41tYce18I1w", "votes": "607", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRszQaX-mCi4wMMwCs5hYfkJLDdNycQR1EKbDoA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And cows on small farms life good lives. I see them when I drive out of town. They are always with their calves or just chilling and eating some grass. I'm a Christian and in the first and second testament God says it's okay to hunt. My area needs hunting. There are so many deer if they aren't hunted even more would get killed by cars. Not all the animals around us belong there. Those deer would die a much worse death if nobody hunted them. Also, those local farms usually kill the cows quickly with a stun gun. Compare that to the wild where they may get a disease for 8 months before dieing and being eaten alive. And I never said everyone should hunt, it depends on the area. But it's also true with the opposite. People need to hunt it else certain species in certain areas will take over. I also like cooking. I enjoy tossing in a pork chop or red meat every weak or two. I already eat nuts and all the other providers of protein. I also enjoy working out. A medium rare steak plan seared with fried garlic is just too good. Same thing with a brisket or ribs. I'll try and be good for the environment in other ways. However, eating meat and driving a gas car are too things I really don't want to give up. The only electric car I've seen that is good is the Porsche Taycan Turbo S. That thing is $200k. All Tesla's are made poorly and if get damaged sit at a repair shop shop for ever a year.

It's because they don't have any. They aren't native to here but have taken over. And the contraceptive isn't cost effective. You could just have people hunt them for their meat and use it. Or you spend $300-1000 on each deer to prevent them from having kids. There other ways my state should be spending money, $600 on each deer isn't a good one. The meat industry isn't going anywhere. And by selling that extra deer all you're doing is helping the local economy if anything. And if you don't want to sell it, you could butcher it up into different cuts or make deer jerky  There aren't any alternatives to ribs or brisket etc. I already use plants and spices in my cooking. I also use meat, I use way more vegetables anyways. For example, last week I made a French mother sauce (sauce espagnole). That sauce would not tase right without using beef broth. Yet their is still over a pound of vegetables in there. And as I stated when it comes to cars. There aren't any electric cars that would be an option. Tesla's have many issues which I already explained. Than we look at other electric vehicles in a reasonable price range. One of the only options is a Prius. Which isn't a fun driving experience. I could pick up a 2017 Golf GTI for the same price. That car would be fun to drive, still get good gas mileage, and I'd be able to modify it, and work on it with ease.

But the one they tested in my state cost $300-1000 per deer. Also there isn't a reason to not consume the extra deer. Most of the soil in my area seems perfectly fine. It's just eating the extra ones. There are strict regulations on hunting. You can't just go out with a gun and shoot stuff. Also, there is no way to make the meat industry disappear without impoverishing many people. Those farmers would have to sell all the equipment used for cows, pigs, etc and buy equipment to produce wheat. That would mean all these farms would have to throw away that equipment as no one would want it. Than they'd have to invest the capital to start producing plants. That's not going to happen. Farmers don't make much, investing capital would most definitely not help them out. And I never said veganism isn't growing. I'm saying the meat industry will not disappear. Also, there are already farms of both types in my area. And there isn't any benefit to eating fake ribs. At best it tastes the same with less protein. At worst it tastes horrible, had the wrong texture, and still has no protein. And I don't think not having a traditional french mother sauce will kill me. Simply put, I enjoy it. I also see why I should get a bean burger. If I want a burger, I'll have a burger. If I want something with beans, I'll have that aswell. No reason to try and make one the other. Also I didn't really make any assumptions. I simply said do all those things and more and than you'll be as good as you can be for the environment. And I am making it sound ridiculous. I'm also a tech enthusiast, and going into the IT sector. I won't be giving up my PC for a sustainably sourced one even knowing it affects the countries my parents came from. I simply build my own computer, if those metals were mines from west africa. Than it is what it is. I'm not going to live like a caveman ya know. I like the saying bang for buck. And I always strive for it. So maybe someone sells a $3,000 PC made from sustainable sources(not sure if this is a thing). Won't be buying it. I'll be spending $1,200 to build my won PC that will perform good while not being that expensive ( in the realm of PCs this is avg) I try and save electricity by using LEDs. I also enjoy going out side. So going down mount bikes sounds like a blast to me. But I wouldn't give up  a car for a bike. And solar panels are something I would install if money wasn't an issue. If you ask there's a balance. I'm not going to go through college, make $100k + and donate it all to charities. But I would also still donate to Charities. I may save up for a car priced at $200k, but I would still donate money. I would also rather live in a 4,000 sqft house than a tiny one that uses almost no energy. Grew up broke, didn't like it.

However, I wouldn't hunt something because it's impressive. I'd hunt because there are too many. He says that those predators will have to hunt the deer for ex anyways. So by killing more I'm doing more harm. Normally I'd say this is true, however. I've seen about one predator of deer in my life. Compared to dozens of deer. If all those predators eat as they please, there will be extra deer(at least in my area). Those predators aren't hunted, the only ones you'd see killed are the ones killing cows. Which doesn't happen often in my area. And I understand the slavery thing. But hunting or small farms isn't putting any person's life in danger or making someone's life worse. Animals=/=humans. I don't have a problem with people saying to not hunt whales. Because they are very close to extinct and are not found often. So it makes sense to not hunt them. Unless it's a small ritual village that doesn't hunt many. Deer are abundant, maybe there's a way to bring the population down without hunting. But I don't really see that as a positive. The deer would die without kids, or it would have kids that would be hunted and eaten. Those are compreble if you ask me. I'm perfectly fine with whale hunting being illegal.

Some think they didn't have a significant cultural thing they could be identified by, unlike Baby Boomers. That's why the name stuck, and the later generations kept the naming convention. Millennials were born around the turn of the millennia, so Gen Y is usually dropped for Millennial. Gen X and Gen Z have other nicknames that aren't used as often. Gen Z has also been called iGen. The generations before the Baby Boomers are the Silent Gen, Greatest Gen, Lost Gen, etc. I don't know/haven't heard of any generation names before lost generation, probably because most of them aren't alive anymore.

Also, it's good for your health, studies show that it adds 10 years to your life. And researching veganism makes you think about morals and ethics too, and makes you wonder if it's right to harm something just because it's not as smart as you. I think we should still show compassion for animals even if we are \"better\" than them. I believe you about the health reasons though, that's valid. I always tell myself that I have to save myself before I save the world. I want to be vegan, but I'm too picky (I would end up malnourished) so I'm vegetarian for now.  One of the most annoying things about the vegan community is that people say everyone can go vegan,, and if you don't you are just making excuses. In reality, it's a privilege since takes a lot of time to research and learn how you are cook, etc.  Plus some people have food allergies that already make their diet really limited. And if you've had an eating disorder it can be triggering to go vegan.

My disagreement with experts has more to do with the reliance on carbon dating in determining the atmospheric pressures and temperatures from before we started measuring them ourselves.

As a Creationist (and to be fair this is an incredibly biased opinion and a reflection of my beliefs, not one of science), I believe that only God can change the climate.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Josh S", "channel": "UCEvoJEv7VDmzcOp0fy-1Awg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRSOfJ1J-o0hjSDpKU_DzsEKSQmzl_-qWZvi2QuXA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You'll never know unless you've somehow switched into a nonbinary person for a day. Nonbinary has also been proven to be true thing by science, along with being transgender (so both of you are perfectly valid and being transgender doesn't make you any less of what gender you transitioned to). All identities are valid, and you can't invalidate what they're going through, unless you've been through it yourself. I can't and won't say being transgender isn't valid because I haven't experienced it, and that they're just trying to be quirky, but I know it's a real thing bc there are so many people who experience gender dysphoria and have to go through the struggles. Being nonbinary is a real and valid identity, and even if you think they're just trying to be 'trendy', then they'll grow out of it, let them do their thing. If they're not just trying to be 'quirky and trendy', then it'll be proven it's a real identity and they'll grow up nonbinary.

A lot of people supported him out of desperation, like people in poverty, who have lost their jobs. They thought he was more like the adverage person than the regular politician.

While I do believe in science I do believe that on a psychological basis - what we cannot see directly impacting us we tend to disregard as it is not considered ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù or to our current need to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù I mean on a basis of minute to minute. Now, as I do have a inquisitive mind, I do like to question climate change not to say that I don‚Äôt believe in it but, I can see why people tend to disbelieve- it is easy when you do not follow the masses that you believe this may be propaganda to fuel a paranoid state within people. When people are scared they are easy to dictate and control hence alluding that potentially climate change is a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù however, when we do look into history and metrology we can understand that our earth has gone through many changes and it is our planet going through it‚Äôs natural course- however, climate change is the understanding that humans are exacerbating the rate of yes emissions, and the temperature of our planet. Now, how I would look at this in juxtaposition is - are we simply just speeding up our time ‚Äúleft on this planet?‚Äù As we all know the nature of life is to ultimately die and our planet will one day do this. So, just to challenge thoughts - is it a bad thing that we speed up our process to ultimately die? And not to say I‚Äôm a preacher or in any way religious but, learning about many different beliefs and religions is it ultimately our fear of ‚Äújudgment day‚Äù when everything dies that we are afraid of? Because this does play on my mind a lot. Because of course if we demand more and more and more of a species or natural environment there will be stress response of mutation until that environment cannot handle that anymore and will die. To reiterate - I am not opposed to climate change but, I do think the questions and our concerns are ultimately out of our control - much life if a gamma ray was to hit us. We wouldn‚Äôt know - we would be dead before we even knew what was going on. As much as I am for change and doing the right thing, I don‚Äôt think we ultimately can control death. We are not a ‚ÄúGod‚Äù but, we can prolong life yes. But, what happens when we can no longer sustain it? That day will come.

Many speculate it stems from family history, OCD, or just pure anxiety. There are over 200,000 cases in the United States yearly. Hair from anywhere on the body is susceptible to being pulled at, but it‚Äôs typically around the eyes and on the head. It‚Äôs more easy to notice during childhood and is often diagnosed in children more commonly than adults. It‚Äôs treatable to stop being so severe, but it‚Äôs highly unlikely anyone will be able to stop entirely. I got psychiatrist who helped me out with it. Many people with it feel ashamed, embarrassed, or distressed.
