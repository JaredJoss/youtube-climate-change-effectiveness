One flaw is see in this theory though is the very basic principal utilised that because the Earth gets warmer that desert must develop everywhere.  That's very linear, and doesn't account for the fact that the Sahara was created due to cooling, not warming, and many scientists believe that as the Earth gets warmer, the Sahara will once again become far more habitable again.  Also, as sea levels rise (and, by the way, sea levels have been much higher than this before), sea currents will start to alter, which will obviously affect micro-climates, for example like Western Europe, meaning that the temperate nature of the Western Europe could easily cool, which then has a knock-on effect, which effects something else, which effects something else, etc, etc.  There's no way to predict what will really happen.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Captain Teabag", "channel": "UCMem9Eb1nVTsvVwV8bzX1kw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRGNW5ZROlzrYFDET4XYUnUaVktWo55QtihZnUX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Costal deserts happen but they tend to include a mix of costal mountains and cold water currents like in Peru.\n\nThis map ignores technology. Interior cities in desert regions will likely suffer but anything within 100 miles of the coast can pipe in desalinated water and combined with AC, this will make them habitable though going outside during the heat of the day might be a no go. Cities like Atlanta, Orlando, LA, etc. will only get bigger and irrigation will keep them green. So places like central Europe and South America might have a hard time but the US, China, France, etc. will still be major powers.\n\nThe Greenland ice sheets won't retreat that much, not if we're staying in the 21st century.

{"cid": "Ugx08S1VIt_H8Y5Wxul4AaABAg", "text": "I watched this and listened to the cheerfully chirpy, upbeat, and entirely inappropriate tone of the presenter with increasing disbelief as it went on. The guy was outlining the circumstances in which some ninety percent of the world's population would be displaced by floods, drought, famine, and the ensuing violence, as if this was some kind of video game instead of the probable extermination by violence and famine of most of the human race. He mentioned nothing about the fact that almost every nation would throw up barbed wire fences, sow minefields, install autonomous armed robots (LAWS - if they had access to them), and instruct their border guards and navies and coastguards to open fire and sink the fleets of boats and rafts crowded with starving men, women, and children trying to escape the death and misery inflicted on their homelands. Greek border forces have already pushed overcrowded rubber dinghies full of desperate families back out to sea, Italy has come close to doing the same, and some media outlets and politicians in the UK are making this kind of demand when we only have a few thousand refugees coming every year - when the numbers reach the hundreds of thousands annually I suspect I know what will happen. \n\nSeveral of the countries most seriously affected (eg. India, China, Pakistan, and Israel) are already nuclear armed and several more will be in the next few decades, and conflicts between these nations, or Civil Wars within them, would be inevitable. Additionally, there is no indication that Global Warming due to a runaway Greenhouse Effect would stop at an extra four degrees C. If we cannot hold the temperature rise to one and half degrees then we cannot hold it anywhere and it will rise as far as the physical processes we have set in train (irreversible feedback loops) will allow it to, perhaps four or five degrees, or perhaps ten or fifteen degrees - in which case human extinction is definitely on the cards (if nuclear war doesn't wipe us out first). \n\nAnd a final point: if the fantastical scenario of the mass relocation of most of humanity to the far North and Antarctica did take place, what is going to happen to the one thousand odd nuclear reactors around the world that need decades of patient and expensive work to decommission and whose waste will need to be kept in secure storage for centuries or millennia?", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Exiled_Londoner", "channel": "UCRJCJY2dlCV3hiz_7EQmKWg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgwrjMNBK4j9vgTDvkc-987dJxjf71Jszp2A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Countries in the north would be inundated, there would be no infrastructure built to support enough people.  Do you understand how much it would cost and how much resources it would take to relocate people from vast areas on the planet to the north?  The amount of people that could die, would be unforgivable.  Also some groups of people basically hate each other.  They would be all forced to live together.  \n\nWhat your video is showing is a huge world war over resources.  A collapse of civilisation over most of the planet. Just because the ice melts does not mean you can just move in and farm or even just build.  Massive supply chains would be needed.

The sea level changes ignores the fact that the Earth is a spinning oblate spheroid hence liquid water would tend to flow to the equator, flooding equatorial areas more and possibly lowering rather than rising closer to the poles.  Also keep in mind that the land at high latitudes tend to be on thousands of feet of permafrost which would thaw and collapse releasing methane leading to greater greenhouse effects.   We are already seeing rapid land erosion in the north due to thawing permafrost.  The northern lands are far more likely to become the shallow seas they once were then become arable farm lands...  Remember three quarters of Canada is on permafrost and during the last warm climate metastability was mostly a shallow sea hence the oil reserves, note the US was also mostly a shallow sea during the last warm period.\n\nGreenland only appears gigantic on a Mercator projection map.  It is large but not as two dimensional maps imply.\n\nWe also know that the warm climate metastability is six degrees greater than the interglacial ice age climate which is the least stable climate metastability.

The Gulf of Mexico will continue providing plenty of moisture.  Of more concern would be the replacement of snow with rain over the US during winter and precipitation falling more as brief, intense storms instead of soaking rains.  \n\nThe ITCZ will not go away, and neither will the intense heating of the Tibetan plateau that diverts it northward during the Northern Hemisphere's spring.  It is hard to see how the Sahel moistens while the high-sun rains over eastern Africa go away -- those impulses traveling west from the Indian Ocean cross the plateaus and mountains of East Africa, and their descent spins up the disturbances that water the Sahel, emerge in the Atlantic, and become hurricanes.  (Counterpoint:  if the Indian monsoon's wet phase requires more than the diversion of the ITCZ north of the Himalayas to trigger. then those impulses coming ashore in Somalia may be cut off.)  \n\nNorthern Russia is probably better placed for agriculture than northern Canada.  Temperature is only one of many factors that inhibit agriculture over the Canadian Shield -- the soils tend to be thin, poorly drained, infertile and acidic where they even exist.  \n\nAlso, the report does not quite understand how cold northern Canada and Alaska are.  The northwest limit of Canadian agriculture is around the 58th and 59th parallel in Alberta.  High Level, AB has an aveage annual temperature of -1.5 C, which would rise to 6.5 C, a level comparable to Fargo, ND (5.7 C) and St. Cloud, MN (6 C).

I mean, most climate is a result of ocean currents rather than the amount of sun a place gets, which is why Europe is so warm compared to places at similar latitudes. \n\nWith global warming, ice caps melt. This will inevitably cool the warm ocean currents and where the warm and cool water meet, massive storm form, which we already see. As they cool down more, we will see random cold snaps in places like the Gulf of Mexico and Europe. Well, this has already happened too in Texas. This should eventually cause global cooling which goes way, way, way too cold. Maybe it stabilizes and starts to rise, but the near future should just be colder... I think. \n\nYou also have to account for rising sea levels producing more water supply to rivers and lakes and even creating new ones, which makes an area more moist than dry.\n\nOkay, that‚Äôs my stupid idea :)", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Tyler Hendrix", "channel": "UC2ng7BJtzRyLEKxA6BDYuTw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS27RMlC3K2_zILDHnYaSteu6FC_BUXp1O4p2PPgg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Huge changes in the AMOC. \n\nAlso Greenland warmed 10¬∞C in 10 years. But the globe did not warn as fast. According to Antarctic Ice cores, temperatures rose only 2 to 3¬∞C in the course of a couple centuries. The Global temperature reconstruction shows Earth only warmed 0.5¬∞C to 1¬∞C in couple centuries, looking at global temperature reconstruction. Global temperatures warmed overall a total of 4¬∞C to 6¬∞C from about 20,000 years ago to about 6,000 years ago.\n\nThe younger dryas certainly wasn‚Äôt a global event. It was mainly in parts of the northern hemisphere. The story in Antarctica is somewhat different, however. The ice core record shows that climate changes in Antarctica were out-of-phase with those in the Northern Hemisphere (EPICA Community Members 2004). The amount of the hydrogen isotope called deuterium, is proportional to temperature. The deuterium record indicates that, contrary to the Northern Hemisphere records, temperatures were relatively low prior to the Younger Dryas (a period called the Antarctic Cold Reversal) and rose during the Younger Dryas.  \n\nCurrent global temperatures are rising at a rate of 0.2¬∞C per decade and can warm at a rate of 0.4¬∞C to 0.6¬∞C per decade by end century if no action is taken.

{"cid": "Ugzah65eqpLlpc7mcit4AaABAg.9MVPg8CpIY09Mwm4A-o6Qa", "text": "¬†@Kathy Byers¬† yes, that‚Äôs because of Milankovitch cycles. During a glacial interglacial cycle. Earths axis and orbit changes over the courses of tens of thousands of years. These changes warm the earth a little, than as earth warms, the warmer oceans release co2, this co2 caused further warming taking earth into an interglacial period. Co2 may lag temperature in the northern hemisphere, but countless studies have shown it leads temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere. \n\nCo2 is a greenhouse gas, we have known that since 1896.\n\nIf Co2 doesn‚Äôt cause global warming, why was it much hotter millions of years ago when solar output was so much weaker? And why is it colder now with stronger solar activity.\n\nAlso, you know how I know the current warming isn‚Äôt due to Milankovitch cycles? Because the glacial period ended over 10,000 years ago and the peak holoence temperature was over 5,000 years ago, for the past few thousand years, earth has actually been cooling and we should have another glacial cycle in another 16 to 20 thousand years. But we are not. Global temperatures are rising very fast. \n\nOver the past 30 years, the global average temperature has warmed by about 0.7 degrees Celsius. Now we want to put this 0.7 degrees Celsius warming over 30 years in context of other large climate changes in earth‚Äôs history. Some of the largest and fastest global climate changes in the geological record are associated with the Milankovitch cycles. The most recent Milankovitch cycle transition was that from the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago (when about a mile of ice was on top of Boston) to the Holocene climate starting about 10,000 years ago and this transition was characterized by a global warming of about 5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThus, this rather dramatic climate change was characterized by a rate of change of 5 degrees Celsius over 10,000 years or 0.005 degrees Celsius per year. \n\nNow we can put the global warming of the past 30 years in context. 0.7 degrees Celsius over 30 years is 0.023 degrees Celsius per year. So the warming of the past 30 years has been about 5 times (0.023/0.005 = 4.6) faster than the warming that occurred over the transition from the last glacial maximum to the preindustrial climate. \n\nAlso CO2 levels are currently leading the temperature rise right now. So I don‚Äôt know your point. Even if lagged it in the past, that doesn‚Äôt mean it always lags it.\n\n2020 tied 2016 as the warmest year on record. According to NASA, global temperatures are the highest in at least 125,000 years. 125,000 years ago, Earth was in an interglacial period that was 1 to 2¬∞C warmer than the one we are currently in. (Sea levels are also 20 feet higher than today which is 1950 in climatology.) co2 levels were only around 280 ppm. Current co2 levels are around 415 ppm. That‚Äôs the highest in 3 million years. 3 million years ago, global temperatures were over 2 to 3¬∞C higher than 1950 levels. Indicating that global temperatures are still catching up to co2 levels right now. \n\nIf co2 doubles in the atmosphere (it‚Äôs already increased by 40% corresponding with 1.2¬∞C temp rise) than global temperatures should rise 1.5 to 2¬∞C.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Sir.

Basically, without plants the good soil up top gets blown away and you get the useless shit below it. Because of this a lot of African countries are planting forests at the edge of the Sahara to stop it from spreading. \n\nThe immediate cause is the loss of most vegetation. This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and¬†deforestation¬†for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the¬†biological composition of the soil. Studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover.[50]¬†Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "JOSEPH WODARCZYK", "channel": "UCH64kUS6lloI0E8FsfSXVcQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTcq5cOzKQDZ6lJRzcECFiEjYOulkMchfRarA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But there is no way to stop the world's glaciers melting and thus raising sea levels and making rivers seasonal, there is no way to halt the multiple feedback loops that are already coming into play, there is no way to save agriculture (food production) in regions where the aquifers are drying up and the rains are no longer reliable, there is no way to take billions of tons of carbon out of the atmosphere over the necessary timescale (at the rates currently possible we would need millennia to make any real difference), and there is no way to prevent hundreds of millions from being displaced by floods and famine (and the resulting wars) over the next few decades.

We are indeed coming out of the last ice age, but the rate that this is occurring is far, far faster than natural levels. More than a 1C in a century is nothing to scoff at and we are heading towards another 1C in half that time. Friendly reminder that volcanoes produce 200 million tonnes of CO2 annually, while total human emissions produce 40 BILLION tonnes annually, this isn't even a comparison. Even if they were even, the difference is that volcanic emissions are recycled and removed from the atmosphere, either by very slowly radiating into space, or come back to the surface through various processes. Human emissions don't have those because they are constantly renewed. All the CO2 produced by us will stay in the atmosphere for millennia and will continue to warm even if we stopped today.

Israel is a nuclear state and there's been scares about potential developments of nukes in Saudi Arabia and, far less likely, Iran. These countries all hate eachother. They also happen to be some of the biggest oil producers, and also happen to be extremely likely to be ravaged by climate change. Israel in particular is small but militarily very powerful due to US support and mandatory military service, and so if some calamity effects Israel like a water shortage or agricultural failures, expansion may be the only option. This will lead to conflicts with their neighbors and this may lead to Israel using nuclear weapons on them. A similar situation could occur with a nuclear Saudi Arabia or another gulf state.\nIndia and Pakistan are also nuclear states and the weapons are pointed directly at eachother. It's not enough to destroy eachother entirely, but its enough that if they go to war probably a few hundred million will die in from the nuclear war and it will just absolutely massacre humanity's chances at environmental recovery because now we have a new problem, massive amounts of nuclear fallout. Both are currently at a tense stand still and a large part of the reason they went to war so often is because of control over the water sources like the Indus river. Really, it's the British who fucked up here. Pakistan, Bangladesh and India should have never been made separate countries based on religion. The idea was so terrible that I'm honestly convinced the Brits designed it specifically to cause a war between the two new countries in the former Raj after they left.\nThere's also North Korea, who has a small arsenal which I don't they intend on using, only waving around to stop others from invading them. I honestly don't think they're as big a worry as everyone says and we may as well just include those nukes as a part of China's arsenal. \nThen there's the big three nuclear powers, USA, China and Russia. If any of them gets mad at another enough to push the button, humanity is an extinct species. Maybe there will be a tribe who are deeply isolated away from the fallout who survive, and then maybe they spread out and recolonize the whole earth after millennia and make the same mistakes. Or maybe they also die of starvation due to the sun being blotted out by all the ash and debris.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Swagmund_Freud666", "channel": "UCVTqxF8SuYA2NjRl1Hc6pSw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTyNO7f6mRejEJRXUGD6uzuNNYj1tI1EDkUq43t=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But only in situations where there is an abundance of other essential nutrients. However, it can be different in the long term.

CO2 plays direct role, and we know this direct contribution when doubling. However it is more critical how the whole system responds, mainly driven by HO2. As the new factor due to human activities is CO2 emissions, the rest as called as feedback. It is impossible to calculate this feedback theoretically, unless you enter empirical observation, which differs per area or temperature range in a chaotic way. \nWe are not out of range in terms of absolute values. However we are out of range in terms of how quickly CO2 is added in atmosphere. Biosphere needs to adapt fast, and this is the problem. However this is not the only problem about human activities.

Variety is nice - but according tonGates the world will end in 50 to 100 years if we do not reduce green house gases.\n\n2: Budget airlines for the last 30 years.Low paid working class people are flying 3 to 5 times a year - and the wealthy are flying 5 to 10 times a year. Business travellers 10 plus times a year for many non essential trips for an expenses paid jolly - for a meeting that could have been held online. \n\n3: Powerful 4 litre - 4 wheel drive cars are now the norm. If global warming was real then these cars would be banned full stop / ‚Äòperiod‚Äô as the Americans say. The green taxes applied do not even prevent a low paid worker having a big flash jeep.Small electric cars would have been subsidised so much we would all have had them. \n\n4: Instead the Governments around the world had solar panels subsidies and substantial cash back reward schemes for electricity generated. The rewards were good that the rich filled their farm land with thousands of solar panels and drained the so called green subsidy kitty dry within 2 years -  so the schemes were scrapped before the average home owner could install 8 panels on his roof and use some green solar electricity. For 8 panels / 4 kWatts you would  get ¬£2000 cash back every year. So a rich person who had 1000 thousand panels installed on land was receiving ¬£2 million for a 25 year scheme.\n\nIt was free money for the rich.

Close to the polar regions the lack of sunlight during winter will prevent plant life, as no known species are adapted to live in a warm climate with such long periods of low light. Most probably all boreal forests will be consumed by invasive insect species.

If you want to be scientific, Teal, you must make a prediction that can be measured. So if you believe melting ice will significantly change tectonic movement, you can point to an event in the past where it was observed. The problem there is finding such information, so it is just speculative until then. What we do know is that the plates move very slowly based on fissure locations, not what is happening on the surface of the Earth. In fact, the Atlantic Fissure expands rapidly compared to others and it is nearly completely covered by the coldest parts of the Atlantic ocean. I'm sure ice pushes down, but should it all melt, which we believe happened before, I'd like to see actual data as to how much the plate would \"float up\" on the magma and over what period of time should we expect to observe a measurable change. But you first offered the ageless \"water expands\" argument. Yes, we all are familiar with water. In fact it is highly measurable just how much water expands. So, for the people that took grade school science, can you recall what temperature the oceans are now, and how much expansion should we expect with a 1 or 2 degree Celsius average temperature rise? You will find it very difficult to argue for a significant rise. In fact, you could argue sea levels may decrease as more water evaporates and falls on the land, filling lakes, rivers and aquafers. I'm not paid enough to do all that math, but, if the government ever decides to fund the science, I'm sure many will offer their services, but that is a big \"if\".

We all see how this has become a political issue, but I will stand with the doubters only because I've yet to be convinced of your belief that there is a danger. In fact, I've read a few takes on sea-level rise and they are all polluted with political talking points. I've tried to track down the math as to how someone somewhere came up with 60 meters of sea-level rise and I cannot find it. Science is not being done here. This is why my math teachers always said \"Show your work\". I don't care if you can do the math in your head, I need to see it and know you actually didn't just make up crap for some government grant because you know how to play the modern game of academic moneymaking and are legitimately doing real science.\nSo, David, I respect that you agree with all these reports of the world coming to an end due to climate change, and I appreciate that you want to look at everything together, but science is not done that way. Make a prediction based on your grander vision, such as \"Sea levels will rise one meter in 5 years to meet our expectation of 60 meters in 120 years.\" or \"All ice will melt on our northern pole during one summer month within 5 years.\" or something to that effect. Use a verifiable method of measuring. Then let other scientists pick apart your work, (not a bunch of like-minded scientists going after the same government funding).\nBeing a cynic has served me very well. When you don't see real science and you do see a lot of \"scientists\" making fatalistic claims, being a cynic allows you to consider alternative motivations. \nAre you aware that besides government funding of academia to push a political agenda, you can invest in carbon credits?

You don't believe that we have had a top ten hottest global average since records began, every year without fail since the 70s.  OK fair enough you don't believe in easily verifiable facts. Let me make it a bit more real and describe what I mean by \"catastrophic\" for you.\n\nThe temperature will go up and humidity will increase significantly to the point where we achieve 100% humidity across half of the currently occupied landmass.\n\nIt is not possible to survive at 35c at very high humidity.  It's called wet bulb temperature, it's pretty basic physics.  Feel free to look it up. At 35c at high humidity you cannot sweat anymore, as there is nowhere for the water to evaporate into and your body continues to heat up. \n\nLuckily today we do not currently have 100% humidity and 35c.  We have lots of places that get a lot higher than 35c and lots of high humidity. But we don't currently get 35c in full humidity yet.   Unluckily we are well on course to go above 2c. \n\nThere is lots of variability with climate modelling with extreme air temperatures swinging by significant amounts, but despite this uncertainty across our climate models with air temperatures, there is very high consistency across all climate models around the wetbulb temperatures, as its much more basic physics.\n\nThis wet bulb temperature is inevitable beyond +2c and means that the 3bn of the global population who live in this easily defined region will become either 100% nocturnal or die.  Not everyone can afford to live in air conditioning and unless you are a service worker, it means that you cannot work at all.  Farming at night isn't a realistic option and if you have been to the tropics you will understand that even at night it will be incredibly hot and unpleasant to work in the dark.\n\nDoes that make sense to you?

My point in ensuring you understood the experimental part was to make the point no one has journeyed to the center of the earth no matter what Hollywood says. Based on the bending of waves, we ESTIMATE density and distances. We know magma erupts from volcanoes, so it follows that what we call mantle is liquified rock and makes up the vast majority of our core.\nGreenland is quite small relative to the plate and it sits near the north-eastern corner. I've seen no math showing just how much pressure it applies to the plate and how that pressure would be distributed. \"Enormous\" doesn't cut it. All of that is speculative.\nThe earth's crust also changes depth based on elevation. We believe the crust is thicker under mountains and thinner under oceans. \nIf you believe that all the ice will melt (which I don't believe, btw) and can measure, say, the elevation of the western part of Iceland (not Greenland) compared to that of the eastern part of the island and how it changes over a period of time that correlates to the melting of some measurable amount of ice from Greenland, then you may have a case. I'm of yet not convinced anyone has come close to doing this nor does it pose a significant threat to anyone not living near a volcano in Iceland (which is already dangerous, so still not impressed).\nI repeat \"Scale\". We're talking about a tectonic plate that is probably millions of times more massive than the ice you fear will cause it to shift. It moves already relative to other plates, so where is the change in danger from earthquakes or volcanoes, or whatever you think is going to happen should all the ice melt?", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Greg", "channel": "UCzXA7taQ4L1r3JPC8xB3EQw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTT5YlAdI-_z6L9FA_iVY-Wsb2F4YoTmTsutNiEzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "ballomni", "channel": "UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSu_PGYp6k79oSFOphOwlNS5Wi2I0lOCWhISZo=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What this also means is that where rain is more likely to fall it will absolutely 'bucket down'! causing massive flooding, coastal erosion and landslides. And then there IS that problem of Hurricanes, globally the likely hood of them has already increased as has their severity @ only 1 degree at present, I suspect that if we get to 4 degree warming we might see them forming not only at the  Equatorial line but possibly at the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer as well.

{"cid": "UgwISvHI00yB9-NibLV4AaABAg", "text": "For thinking people; ah, the great debate on climate change. \n\nOne way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it.  I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major taking one side or  the other.  \n\nWhat I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn't support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is supportive, while anything  post that would support the argument stays.  Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...\n\nFrom NASA:¬† Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the¬†ice age¬†would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional ‚Äúblips‚Äù every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth's orbit‚Äîeccentricity, obliquity, and¬†‚Äîaffect global climate. But it's a lot more complicated than that.  \n\nAnd, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn't do so well because it's hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis.  Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100's of millions of years.\n\nSo, I totally believe in climate change... It's been going on for 100's of millions of years, since planet formation.¬† Long before humans arrived;  and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.\n\n\n\nAnd, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. \n\nI'll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.\n\nIt's pretty easy to get the impression that the narrative is being used as a political tool to try and get vast groups of people behind yet another 'crisis', then steer them to support a politician who puts himself up as a though-leader on the subject.

I haven't watched the rest yet but it sounds like he's on the verge of hysterically laughing as he talks about rivers drying up and everything turning into a desert.\n\nEdit: Also, we could've used a key to explain what we were looking at on that map. What is the brownish gray areas compared to the yellow which is sand? I thought it may be mountainous areas considering it went over the Himalayas but it's also over areas that are covered in forests right now, and wouldn't some of those mountains start having forests grown on them or become more suitable for agriculture higher up where the reason stuff can't grow right now is because of the cold? Too many questions for you to have never explained what the different colors of that map mean. It's just yellow=bad and green=good? It's not that simple. Plus, if there really are so few agriculturally stable areas left, is that map showing \"habitability\" or the potential to grow crops in those areas? Because if the green just means they could grow crops there then with better methods of supply it's still completely possible for people to live in the yellow areas, if only the yellow areas closest to the green and areas on coastal lands or near rivers that could get easy access to trade. I'm just too confused by your confident conclusions in this video of how people will have to migrate, entire populations getting up and leaving rather than the possibility that flooding would be prevented the same way Louisiana avoids flooding despite all of New Orleans being below sea level. If your title was how it \"Could Change\" rather than how it \"Will Change\" I would've given you some more leeway here. But not only aren't you describing geography in too much of this as you discuss human responses and movements, you've made broad claims about rivers drying up and forests being destroyed without backing that up with anything. Will a 4 degree difference cause all those trees to die, or is it the lack of water from drying rivers which causes them to dry? Either way, Brazil has one of the biggest stores of water resources in the world, like Canada and Russia which are still in the green on your map. Brazil would have to deal with much hotter temperatures but I'm not sure what the reason the entire Amazon would be destroyed is in your explanation. Are you saying the forests will die, then at what average temperature will they? It's weird to me that you think this would happen. \n\nIt seems more likely that trees and vegetation that are more heat resistant will wind up surviving and dropping more seeds that grow trees like them, while other trees that couldn't handle the Gradual rise in temperatures would not reproduce as much and would die out. As any mean rise in global temperatures would be Gradual, vegetation would have some time for natural selection as it always has in the past. Forests don't just die from temperature changes. Humans have cut them down for space for farming and in the Amazon that continues to be a problem, but if the Amazon is destroyed it's not going to be from temperature change like you suggested. I don't understand where the reasoning behind it comes from, and if Brazil manages to get a leader in charge who cares more about protecting the forests than expanding agricultural businesses and logging, I can see Brazil saving the rainforest. If, and only if it is saved from being cut down much more, then Brazil's expansive water reserves should keep it alive. Cool temperatures under tree canopies in the shade should keep younger trees alive more too, making the rise in temperatures even more gradual, potentially. There are a lot of factors that go in to how vegetation survives and thrives other than just the temperature it's in. After all, forests grow in all parts of the world. Though with different trees and vegetation, that vegetation has mainly sprouted in those areas naturally and has changed on its own without our involvement for millions of years. When the temperature goes up, yes some species of plants will die, but the whole world isn't going to become a desert because of a 4 degree increase in temperature. The much more likely result will be shifts in the kinds of vegetation that thrive in different areas. Maybe forests will be lower to the ground, not grow as tall, or they will have half as many leaves and be thinner to need less water- Whatever happens, at this moment there are hundreds of ways that the world could go. And this video doesn't make me think that the future you're describing is the actual future of the Earth's geography. Not when you say some things with certainty that we really don't know. Not when you describe human migrations as if modern technology, global trade, and the information age as a whole won't alter those kinds of migrations and the need for them at all. If you were going to say such confident stuff about the desertification of forests you shouldn't have mentioned anything about the necessity for humanity to move into \"habitable\" zones like people don't already live in deserts. I'm only three and a half minutes into the video but it's a shame the way this one's turning out compared to many of the other geography videos on your channel. I get that the other videos are easier to make factual because it's current geography and how it has been utilized by humans in the past, but when talking about the future in an educational video there should be both explanations and mention of your own room for error as it is not possible to Know what really will happen. You are making inferences that you treat as certainties.

Pair that with selective/cyclical grazing to improve the soil quality, for better results.\n\nEven something as simple as using greenhoused ponds to evaporate seawater and leave behind salt or very concentrated brine, funnels to concentrate the vapors, large pipes to move the vapors, and then using solar chimneys to both generate electricity and to cool down the water vapors into liquid water (due to the vaccum effect caused at the ground level effectively dropping the temperature, and air currents getting more high speed air into contact with the cooling pipes and radiators, and due to solar chimneys effectively moving heat higher up into the atmosphere, where the surface area it occupies is larger and above much of the atmosphere, which makes irradiating the heat into space easier), and using shades instead of greenhouses for growing crops (for reducing the amount of sunlight and the temperatures, which would also reduce the evaporation of the water from the soil).", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sapioit", "channel": "UCr0EpmjzKO-Bi9GxzuPNwVQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS2uLaivjyeovKdHjJ6dY1gW7qVBKDhR8eO1ZuWnw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Perhaps the sudden rise will disrupt, but I think you need at least 4c temp rise to start such disbalance. And I do reckon the reality of us having to check on carbon emissions is sinking in.\n\nBesides the role of the Amazon and all rainforests in oxygen and carbon cycles is way over rated. The oceans' algae plankton are the dominant source of global oxygen. Oceans contain about 60 times the CO2 amount of the 1880 's atmosphere, or 16 times the total terrestrial biosphere, including soils. Most of that carbon is out of reach in lower layers of the oceans, yet those upper layers are dominant. Oceans also have taken up about 90% of the heat and +40% of carbon emissions so far. We rally oughta spend more on oceanography, but oddly, the world's smartest and richest seems more obsessed of getting people to the Moon and on Mars.

Same with northern Siberia and most of northern Canada. There is another problem......... understatement........ as you move to higher latitudes, the intensity of the sunlight diminishes over a given area and the seasons shift.  Pollinators will have to adjust, and most won't make it.  So, garden vegetables will have to be grown in greenhouses to exclude pests and people will have to hand pollinate, which produces less robust and healthy plants, fruits and seeds.  No more \"amber waves of grain\", either.\nAs the rivers dry up in the south, the nuclear plants and the numerous spent fuel cooling ponds will not have sufficient water, or power, to pump over the fuel bundles to keep them from going Fukushima.  Thousands of tons of nuclear material will be released as gas, smoke, and chunks as the pools dry out and experience \"prompt nuclear events\"....... like unit 3 at Fukushima Daiichi.  Then, there will be a LOT of warfare and some of it will eventually be nuclear.  Pakistan vs. India.  India vs China.  US vs Russia.  The EMPs will finish off the grid in most places.  No power at the plug, no internet, no phones, no petroleum being pumped OR refined, no water at the taps, no fuel or radar for planes, no nat. gas pumped or processed, no diesel for trucks or trains....so no food brought to stores, no harvesting machinery operating, no controlling dams' spillways, and the list goes on and on.  Sea level rise will take out almost all seaports, so no moving food or material by sea, even IF fuel was available. \nThere is nothing to stop the GAST increase once it gets a good head of steam...  it will blow right past 4C. increase and sail past 6C. and may not stop until 12 or 13C., if it stops at all.

I would suggest they invest in desalination plants run on solar/wind energy also in AU. we have lots of coastline and a lot of vacant sun scorched land, vast solar panel farms would even help to lower the soil temp and if they were raised and watered by the desal plants might even be productive, but at scale it takes a LOT of money. Mid/Est countries spend a lot of money to control/suppress their ppl. and probably wouldn't spend for the ppl.s' sake anyway!", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "john zuijdveld", "channel": "UCg9Uj9-pj1z6r22oaS6V1dA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQHlJ4foJ4OC1583cvqdI5a2wCgAfQtC8CkcA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They are talking about and predict things like they would never seen Earth's climate in action.\nYou can't have more water vapor and the same time more deserts. And global temperature doesn't rise all over the globe equally. If Earth average temperature would go up by 4¬∞C id doesn't mean that all today temperature would just go everywhere up by 4¬∞C, but it would be the different, mainly depending on latitude. Equator would have the same temperatures as today but poles might have 10¬∞C higher average temperatures. So, Earth would not turn to ''Arrakis'' but climate zones would change. Ask yourself what would change to this specific climate zone, if you add more water vapor and temperature. Deserts are deserts because of geographical features, fore some reasons they don't get enough water vapor to sustain plants. And places with low amount of water vapor are the hottest places on Earth. If earth would be warmer for 4¬∞C it would become green AF.

I am not a climate scientist but I have apparently taken more time to educate myself on the topic than you did to make this video. Climate change patterns are more complicated that just being based on lattitude as you seem to think in this video. The earth is not warming uniformly. For example right now the arctic is warming much faster than the rest of the planet. Also, climate is influenced in no small part by ocean currents which will be disrupted by climate change, and things like changes in ocean temperatures and salinity. Another things this video ignores is the devastating effect climate change will have on ecosystems even in the milder parts of the planet, ecosystems that we are a part of. Another way climate change may already be effecting us is that many scientists believe that disease epidemics like the current one will become more common as the earth warms.

Why should we forget the past, when it is one of the best sources to learn from our mistakes and become a better world?\n\n\nThe Homo Sapien species has been around for 200, 000 (two hundred thousand years) years, but humans didn‚Äôt become civilised until 130,000 years ago. Over these years humans created extinctions, and disasters that affected the world and the creatures that lived in the Earth, but mostly, humans affected themselves. We cannot cover up every war, every destroyer of¬† civilisation, every disturbance in the entire history. Events such as global warming, animal extinction, global wars, destruction of trees, interruptions of peaceful and innocent races, famines and every other dark event were all created by humans, and some events, not included in the list, are even denied existence. Instead of trying to cover these errors, we should try and learn from them, and never repeat them.\n\n\nOur past experiences are composed of 2 key things: success, and failure. Either way, we can learn from them and correct ourselves to become better people. For success, we think why it was successful, and how it was successful. If we succeed in winning an award, we would think back how we achieved this prize and the road we took to achieve it. For failure, we think why it was unsuccessful and we‚Äôll try to prevent it from happening. If suddenly your economy collapsed, you would think what did you do incorrectly that led you to failure. The past is a way to learn, and whether the events were successful or unsuccessful, we can still pursue our journey to a better life.\n\n\nYour experiences are precious, but what about others? Everyone has and will experience the world differently, and their experiences are just as valuable as your own experiences. Picture an elder, who walked the earth for a hundred years, who tells you their knowledge and view of the world. Imagine how much more knowledge you can share with your friends now! Or you can even use this knowledge and branch it off even further. But no matter what you do with this information, you would have learnt something you would have never known and become more aware of the world.\n\n\nLearning from others is a great source of information, but what about our parents? Your parents may have put a few rules around the house or even warnings, such as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt watch TV too long!‚Äù Although it is annoying, there could be entire stories that created these rules. Your parents could have experienced failure in the past, and some of them can never be changed. Like any parent, they would want the next generation to avoid the mistakes they made, which if followed could become the golden child of perfection.¬†\n\n\nThe past is full of secrets and wonders and the experiences they give are valuable and meaningful. Society‚Äôs quote of forgetting the past is incorrect and gives a wrong idea to the world and its happenings. Whether it's from history, your family‚Äôs, or yours, it will give you wisdom about the world and how we live.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Mz RW", "channel": "UCd54QjuLUvwRHMpR5V4wX1g", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQF8zzZ6kqFYTRMmL8Ovb9wHMSXl5CM6Y8rUd865A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This would also work to get water vapors from the sea through a funnel-and-pipes system to those shaded areas, where it would condense into mist and/or rain. But they don't want bad enough to solve their heat problem. If the shades were also reflective, that heat would radiate away into space, or it could be focused on a wall and used for solar power, and the excess heat pumped into radiator-towers to have air currents take the excess heat away. This would also allow for large-scale refrigeration, and I mean even city-sized or bigger.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sapioit", "channel": "UCr0EpmjzKO-Bi9GxzuPNwVQ", "votes": "23", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS2uLaivjyeovKdHjJ6dY1gW7qVBKDhR8eO1ZuWnw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I mean, if I remember correctly, arabs import most of their food. So if something happened which made them unable to import that food (like war, for example, or economic sanctions, or a trade ban caused by a second more dangerous coronaplague wave, or even just natural disasters causing the exporting countries to not have enough food to export), then they would be screwed.\n\nPlus that turning the desert areas into farmland would severely increase the living conditions of the people there and the GDP of every nation in the world (thanks to trade). At the very least, it would allow the people who already own land and have infrastructure in areas which recently turned into desert, to claim back farmland from the desert and increase the land value of the land they own. And depending on how much they are willing to pay and the conditions in the area at that time, it would be significantly cheaper than moving somewhere else by selling their land before making it productive again.\n\nAnd don't worry about FBI, it probably already knows my location but I'm not a threat to them.

Even renewable energy has its drawbacks- especially battery and solar power because both solar panels and many rechargable batteries require rare earth metals and other very hard-to-find materials. Rare earth metals in specific have to be extracted in tiny amounts from a massive quantity of rock via strip mining, which fucks up the land, and also creates toxic sludge as a byproduct of extracting the metals from the rock. You have to process MIND BOGGLING amounts of rock to get just a MINUSCULE amount of these metals, and on top of that, over 90% of the Earth's entire reserve of them is in China, and China has ENTIRE LAKES filled with said sludge. Nuclear power (Fission at least) is very bad because the power plants can belch up huge clouds of highly radioactive, toxic and carcinogenic gasses that spread across the entire planet, and radiation leaks from this can render large amounts of land uninhabitable for more than TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS. Not only that, but fission produces spent fuel that stays radioactive for hundreds of THOUSANDS of years, and you have to store it in such a secure way that we really CAN'T completely eliminate the risk of the waste being discovered or freed from its storage by a natural disaster.

So what‚Äôs more likely is rising sea levels, stronger storms, and of course melting of ice. So yeah the Amazon might be gone by then, in fact, there‚Äôs evidence to support that, since it‚Äôs getting drier. We can‚Äôt forget about diseases as well. Tropics diseases now can expand their range thx to this warming climate. So yes, soon we can see the Yellow Fever happening in places like Russia. Also the glaciers are important, because they contain some unknown virus. And not to mention wildfires, they will be more common. Just imagine the Australian fire, but at a much bigger scale.

{"cid": "UgylbuGRgE3e7e8-jXl4AaABAg", "text": "I'm a fan of your videos but I have to dislike this one, there are a lot of flaws in your (technically the book's) reasoning\n1) Half the world won't and can never become a desert. \n-In the case temperatures do rise 4 deg, it will increase global humidity and water vapor levels. Weather patterns will definitely change but the overall effect would be more tropical zones. If you dont believe me, take a look back in history. In the Mesozoic era, Global temps and CO2 levels were higher than today, the resulting climate included tropical rainforests across most of the equator and even at mid latitudes, where drier conditions did exist, they were savannas and not full deserts\n\n2) There will be no mass relocation/migrant crisis because of climate change\n-The very definition of \"climate\" is the overall weather conditions over a long of time. In the odd chance climate change does make conditions worse, it will not all happen in 1 year, rather, it will be spread out over time (maybe 20, 50 or 1000 years). Humans do not adapt to change in one generation but they certainly do over many generations as seen with culture, language, population centers. Given it may take many generations to feel the effects, Humans will naturally move, relocate, whatever t suit their needs. It will be done naturally as individuals decide to buy a new home and companies relocate factories. Ask yourself this question: 100 years ago, did the population centers look the same as they are today? No, look at the most populated areas and you'll see how humans have slowly moved for whatever reason (economic, climate, productivity) There was no sudden movement every time there was a drought or flood so why should we expect the same later?\n\n3) Humans don't need perfect conditions to live (at least in the 21st century)\n-10,000 years ago, if a river dried up, the people around it died. In 2020 however if a river dries up, the people do not simply die, rather they build pipelines, wells, etc to bring the water to them. Imperial valley in California is technically a desert yet it has one of the most fertile farmland in all of California, why is that? They have a canal that supplies all the water they need. Look at Phoenix, temps are sometimes 100F yet its population grows everyday. A/C has eliminated our dependence on good weather and humans will live wherever they can. A change in outside climate will not adversely affect the living conditions of the average home. To add onto this, relocation costs would be too much and cities will find a way to live with what they have. They may build desalination plants, install check valves, use renewables, etc, but they will certainly not move like our ancestors did in the past.

Why would there be so much desert?\n+ The fact that there is more heat energy in the air, would likely change the planetary wind system, which could bless many spots with favourable climate, just like the British Isles today. Again, why so many deserts?\n+ The closer you get to the poles the less solar energy you get, which reduces traditional and greenhouse farming to only the few months around summer. Crop production would not be able to keep up with global demand without vertical farming and farming in the sunnier regions.\n+ Siberia/Central Asia is far far away from the sea latitudewise. That kind of continental weather is usually very dry, hardly appropriate for farming.\n\nWay before our history Earth already had several phases of very hot world climates, hotter than just 4¬∞C from now.

No Khanna did not make this map, and even if he did, he's not a climate scientist and not qualified to do so anyway. He says he got the map from a 2009 article in New Scientist. That article is blocked part way through by pay wall, but it looks like it was created by an environmental journalist. Without reading the article, I don't know the full context for the map, but the way this video presents it is very misleading. Anyone who studies climate knows it is extremely complex, and you can't just paint the whole map as desert. If the earth warmed by 4¬∞ C by 2100, we won't just turn into a desert instantly, there will be a sizeable lag and massive swings in climate over each region of Earth. It would be better presented as a reality far into the future, if we warm that much by 2100 and remain at the temperature or higher. On top of that, I have serious doubts that 2/3 of the world will become a desert, and it's extremely difficult to predict this. Instead of labeling places as a desert, instead low, medium, and high risk for unsuitable climate would be more appropriate. This video is infuriating that it presents something so serious without using a credible source and misleading folks.

Water logged land with nutrient poor soil. Decades will be needed to make the soil able to yield good crops.

These area are and would be uninhabitable for more than just \"It real cold\". Siberia especially eastern Siberia has some of the lowest rainfall records in the world resulting in Siberia being less like the great plains or the Russian steppe, and more like the Canadian Shield is today, a dry, desolate wasteland that just so happens to be temperate, due mainly to the prevailing westerlies pushing all the Pacific moisture East towards Alaska and not over Siberia. On the other hand most of North America would fair much better than today. Why? Thank the ice age. When the glaciers came down they removed all the topsoil in that area leaving only bare rock, which is not good for developing civilization. It would take thousands of years of erosion by both plants and rainfall to pulverize the surface rock into usable soil. Greenland would suffer the same problem. Only the parts of Russia West of the Ural mountains and Scandinavia would truly fit this fertile land of a superpower idea. Not trying to say your wrong, the base assumptions are right but geography is a lot more complex and my main point is that no one would really gain anything out of climate change in any way.

The guy who wrote the book isn't a scientist/climatologist as far as I can tell (as others in the comments have already stated), so he really isn't a reliable source to begin with.\n2. If the world warms up by 4 degrees, it won't \"just make everything a desert.\" Some areas will get less rainfall, but many other areas will get a lot more rainfall.\n3. If the Earth warms by 4 degrees, climates will become more drastic and differentiated, not just all desert.\n4. With a massive amount of cold water entering the oceans from melting ice caps, the ocean's currents will stop moving, which means many places, such as Canada and Northern Euopre, will actually get colder due to the lack of an ocean current bringing warm water and air south and taking cold water and air north.\n5. This is definately the 100% worst case scenario, even if it could happen.\n\nIf this video is based on the book, it isn't scientifically accurate, and even if it was, this would be a worst case scenario. This is based on the assumption that the Earth will warm 4 degrees, which is higher than the predicted average if we stay  on track in terms of how fast we're transitioning to renewable energy. Some of the events in the video might happen to a small degree, but nothing near what is in the video. This is an interesting situation, but likely belongs in the realm of alternate history rather than \"this is definately going to happen.\"\n\n(By no means is this me saying this isn't an issue. This is an issue that we need to solve, and is probably the most important one long-term, but this video will scare people away from  this topic and is probably doing more harm than good.

Read from a climatologist next time please!\n\nNot even sure where to begin with this map, so much is wrong. For starters, Antarctica has been ice for 40 million years. The earth has been 8 degrees C warmer than today, on average, at least 4 times in that period with no ice melt. Also, lets talk deserts. Heat has almost nothing to do with desert formation, it is ALL about the precipitation. During ice ages, when less heat is around, MORE and LARGER deserts exist on average. During hotter times the Earth gets very humid, creating rain forests and jungles not deserts. Still not ideal for human life but a far cry from a sandbox like this seems to assume. It makes a lot of sense, more water + more heat = more evaporation. There also seems to be a massive amount of ignorance of ocean currents involved in this map. Not to beat a dead horse but Spain, France, and morocco will all basically become a rainforest due to the insane amount of moisture hitting the region. Greenland will actually become green, so not sure why there is only a small strip of green on it. Finally, trade. What the hell?

I understand that people can believe that especially if they never feel the affects of it, but unfortunately there is countless scientific studies proving the prevalence of climate change and global warming. People like to argue that the 1-2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature from the 1800‚Äôs could be the cause of the technology giving people in the 21st century the ability to more accurately take temperature readings compared to the 1800‚Äôs, but then you can look at studies of the ozone layer diminishing at a significant rate from just the 1970‚Äôs where we‚Äôve had the ability to spectrograph the atmosphere and take accurate readings of the O3 levels and see that they are reducing. You can even look towards the ocean levels which never really needed advanced equipment to gather data to see that they have risen at an exponential rate over the past 200 years. What do you think will happen these next 100 years if it continues on this exponential path? Entire cities, islands, even countries could be lost leaving people homeless and it‚Äôs your type of ignorance that leads to their lives being ruined. The only people that benefit off the belief that global warming isn‚Äôt real is billionaires that made their money through oil and fossil fuels and don‚Äôt want to waste the time to repurpose their stocks and finances into other long term business opportunities because they won‚Äôt be around much longer to deal with the repercussions.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Tyler Albrecht", "channel": "UCn8U2OlXA5ycMH84rZjidlg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQjI4MKCfmlrg6cDf8BKwTVsrpr468Za4ZoQGQ6ZQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The larger picture is that we've stabilized at a far lower vegetative biomass than existed pre-civilization, that these temporary increases are only seen as plant populations drift poleward, and that this increase is nominal and shouldn't excuse more deforestation.  \nThird, global reforesting efforts are woefully under-diverse, and are (generally) mono-crops developed by lumber industries to meet regulatory reforestation quotas and to feed future logging.

Desertification will only occur in some equatorial regions in the instance of complete deforestation, which in some places is actually somewhat likely, but only some. And others, even in the event of total(or nearly total) deforestation will see more of a savannah/grassland sort of biome take over. Deforestation absolutely causes decreased rainfall due to loss of evapotranspiration in those regions, but oftentimes that rainfall reduction is in other regions that count on those forested areas evaporation to feed their precipitation each year. Long story short, the climate is complicated, the factors are complicated, and the effects of direct man-made change to different regions are complicated. Different biomes could see transformation(or just plain expansion instead) in one of a few different types of biomes depending on all of the other factors that coincide with the increase in temperature. This is why we use climate models to map the different possible outcomes based off of different starting conditions.

When the air gets to the equator it warms and go up in the atmosphere, at the same time the air in the poles become colder and goes down, this flow of air in the equator and in the poles is what makes the entire atmosphere flow. It works like a pump, pumping hot air to the higher and forcing it to go to the poles and cold air in low altitude to the equator. With the air water vapor is carried in clouds and that is why the equator is wetter, because both pumps find one another there and water, being heavier, becomes trapped, condenses and fall in the form of rain.\n\nIt is a basic principle and it doesn't change, the Equator will always be the place on Earth with most precipitation, the only way to change it would be changing the angle of Earth's Rotation.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Diego Natan", "channel": "UCl-RzBn3AmsMUPw9NXLrkow", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8eExky_4qzaK5aX3aBe1novv7w1tnFysg6Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwgDsgI7k1QbJNYjaV4AaABAg", "text": "There's a whole slew of flaws in this video.\n1) Rising temperatures doesn't automatically turn most of the world into a desert. It will mainly affect weather patterns to where what once was desert may very well become arable land because there's this thing called rainfall. And rainfall will ALWAYS happen somewhere. The reason we have deserts in some places isn't the inability for rain to fall there, it's because the way winds blow means these areas rarely get any moist air flowing over it and it's constantly locked into a high pressure zone.\nIf the jetstream shifts just ever so slightly, it's going to mean rain will fall on current deserts.\n\n2) Rising temperatures (in such small degrees) doesn't change the moisture level in the air for the worse. Dry climates exist exactly because most of the planet's water is locked into the oceans. With higher temperatures, more water will evaporate into the air. In other words, air will have a higher capacity to hold water the hotter it is and is the sole reason you get clouds. Warm and moist air rises into colder layers which condenses and falls back as raindrops.\nA hotter climate means this happens more frequently across the globe. Again, what makes deserts deserts is the fact the winds that carry moist air around literally avoid the desert regions of the world.\nLook at Norway, more specifically Bergen. They are pummeled year round by moist air from the atlantic ocean which is forced up against the mountains and so there's heavy precipitation on the western coast of Norway.\n\n3) The assumption that Greenland would still be mostly of arctic climate is laughable at best. In a scenario where average temperatures would rise by 4 degrees, all of Greenland would actually become green in short time. And so would most of the north pole.\nAntarctica might still have some arctic climate though.\n\n4) \"Denmark would become a new superpower because they own greenland\"\nThat is even more laughable. They would lose their claim over Greenland in a heartbeat by other nations.\nSimply focusing on Antarctica as a hotbed for conflict is quite weak. In a scenario where temperatures have risen by 4 degrees, such weak forces like the UN will cease to function completely.\nGreenland will be invaded by whomever decides to start WW III first, which is inevitable in such a scenario.\n5) If there's a demand, there's a supply. Ever heard of the movie Waterworld?\nIn short, people that have nowhere else to go will learn to live on the water. The Netherlands will build their cities Venice style. Floating on the water and their farms will be in large bags that also float on top of the water.\n\n6) You are of course also assuming mankind will even exists as it does today in 80 years from now. I am pretty sure we will have eradicated each other by then.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Cadde", "channel": "UCtekmeOTT4YFgR585seBQWg", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTKNLTLFZfE5KpKcGXBYOifup1qj4PGENQE5cAT=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I know a few Germans who have told me that Bavaria has gotten very little snow compared to last year. As well as that, Northern Germany only got snow on the 30th March, which is quite a weird date tbh considering it hadn't snowed before then at all. I grew up in London but I currently live in Italy because of family reasons. We have obviously had no snow here as Rome has quite a warm climate but I asked 3 friends from London if they had had any snow and they told me that they only got sleet towards the end of February. I know a Youtuber from Helsinki who said that the weather in Finland has been hotter than usual and they barely had snow. Some guy from Southern Norway also described this winter as hot and another one said it literally felt like autumn. A Youtuber from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania went to Upper Michigan to do an experiment by shooting snow and he said he couldn't do it this year in Pittsburgh because over there they had only had 8 inches of snow (this was January btw). He acted like it was nothing but I knew what was really going on. In my spare time, I also search up the weather in places around the world just for curiosity. Tbh, I wish I had plotted the statistics for different places throughout last winter. It would have been really interesting to check my results and compare them to the annual/monthly average.

Last year, there was a heat wave that devasted North-west Europe and broke a record for the hottest temperature ever recorded in the UK. Probably also in the Netherlands and Belgium judging by their proximity. As well as that, in January Antarctica broke a record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet and in the same month Norway broke a record for the hottest temperature reached during winter. I have just started doing research into weather and climate but all I'm saying is that the results I've found throughout this past year have been significantly higher than usual. It's weird how no one's talking about this spike yet so many people all over Europe have pointed out to me that they have felt it themselves. I don't know if this is the new trend for global warming or not but if it is we're screwed because I've never experienced such heat by a milestone. Anyway, just be aware that North America has a very unstable climate. Europe is always temperate because of the gulf stream so you will feel the mild changes whereas in let's say Wisconsin, it can be 5¬∞C one day, the day after there could be a snow storm at let's say -3¬∞C on average and the day after that, it's a sunny day at -15¬∞C. This is why I prefer to study weather patterns around Europe. I just really hope this spike in temperature is only temporary. Only time will tell. To determine the climate of an area you need if I've not mistaken 30 years of research so that's gonna take quite a bit of time", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ricky911", "channel": "UCkSJCkytTxIUvKc_oYakb8w", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/i9RokZ0piasSBXVnc_hUf_9M3xBKREvrIyqW93ul5dNzEV0cYarIGjBHrvp-a01T_twKRoEN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwnBoEdbkXWMu0_mg94AaABAg", "text": "I'm no climatologist, but based on my basic understanding of climate science, most of the world is not gonna turn into a desert as a result of 4 degrees of warming. Sure there will be more deserts in the world with more intensive droughts, but those areas will probably stay around the areas that have high pressure atmospheric conditions already. As for the currently tropical regions, they'll receive more rainfall and more storms unless if the rainforests were chopped down. My overall point is that most of Earth won't become desert, but instead, the areas that have dry climates will become even dryer while the wet climates will be even more wet, either by rainfall or the ocean. It's just some constructive criticism that I want to give because, normally, the information from a RealLifeLore video is believable.

Also I think much of what is said is just false. \n\nThe Video makes it sound like after 3/4 of the world containing around 98% of its population becoming a desert is just something that will happen and is going to work out fine. The consequences that would have are barely mentioned. Just think about the wars that would be fought just for access to water and the billions of refugees dying at the borders of the last few remaining spots on earth left habitable. To think they would all just be able to relocate in Russia, Scandinavia or NZ is naive. Just think about how fast Europe shut its borders after just 2 million people trying to get in! \n\nWhat I think is falsely portrayed in the video is agriculture. I'm not a specialist but I learned a lot about the effects of climate change and a huge part of that was the smashing of the dream of huge farms in Greenland or Siberia. Plants need more than just ok weather. To grow plants take nutritions and organic waste that is buried in the ground. That's actually what the soil is made up of. Anyway, the soil in Scandinavia, Siberia or Antarctica has been extremely frozen for thousands of years. The plants will simply not be able to grow there. The consequence? With most of the current farmlands being deserts and a huge displaced population we will have mass starving. \n\nOverall this video paints some kind of semi-optimistic picture that has given up upon trying to change that future.

{"cid": "UgxRrU2B6FzGAAKoUEl4AaABAg", "text": "That's quite an optimistic statement that well off countries would welcome billions of climate refugees in such a world. Reality of course would be much, much more violent and downright apocalyptic. It would be likely that Fascist regimes would spring up almost everywhere, either pledging to use their military force to keep starving people out or countries invading their neighbours to secure lush and habitable 'Lebensraum' or living space for there populations to move to. Countries like the UK, Island, New Zealand and Australia would be in the best position to withstand the shocks to come. Mainly because they are island nations that are far easier to defend against than countries like Canada who is almost certainly going to be staring down another US invasion or Russia who has the prospect to keep out billions of starving Chinese refugees across thousands of kilometres of borders. Particularly with New Zealand and Australia is that they both reside in the southern hemisphere where only a tenth of the world's population lives and have thousands of kilometres of ocean between them and most of the world, they would be in the best position to survive into the end of the century.\n\nAnother thing is that all that warmed tundra wouldn't be available immediately for agriculture. Arctic soils are acidic, poor in nutrients and are very thin. It might take thousands of years for a soil to form that could support crops. India and Pakistan would almost certainly go to regional nuclear war over the vanishing Himalayan river systems. But no matter how I say it, the world that is four degrees warmer wouldn't be able to support more than a small fraction of the human population that we have now.\n\nYou read about Climate Change and few books and documentaries go to a four degree world or if they do, it is only lightly touched on to avoid turning off its viewers/readers.

Greenland DOES NOT hide alot of land under its ice, but just some mountain chains. Even in a 4¬∞ scenario Greenland would take over a thousand years to melt, revealing little to no farmable land.\n3. If Africa would indeed move alot of people into the sahel zone, it would soon experience desertification aswell, cause it cant maintain the forest it needs while giving home to massive amounts of people. \n4. It would be a bit naive to assume that all the migrants would be welcomed with open arms. More likely will there be fights for water and territory, protectionism and war.\n5. Alaskas Oil wouldnt be worth shit, do you really think that in such an apocalyptic world the people of alaska would be like \"hey lets burn some more fossil ressources, has not hurt us in the past at all...\"\ncertainly more to critic, still thanks for informing about this important topic!

It takes at least 200 years for enough soil to form to support lage-scale agriculture. Any effort to farm these areas before topsoil can properly form would have the same result as Nikita Khruschev's virgin lands scheme.\nThere is also the fact that there is absolutley no way states could survive and be organised enough to carry out a programme of resetlement and colonisation in this scenario. Consider the political chaos that has ensued as a reuslt of a few million Syrians being displaced (the Syrian civil war was partly triggered by cliamte change BTW) now imagine what sort of chaos would reuslt from the entire population of China, most of India, all of Bangladesh nearly all of Latin America and most of the United Sates having to up sticks and move.

You based it on one single map, which is not only very imprecise but also seems to ignore the effects of things like mountain ranges, ocean currents and other things. Also, the areas marked as submerged by the sea seem arbitrarily chosen. A lot of land that would be underwater isn't marked and some areas in red will probably not be submerged. I don't know where this map's creator got it's sources from, but they seem pretty bad. It's really no wonder if you look at the author of the book - he has absolutely zero background in science. Of course, this channel is meant for entertainment, but a video about such an important scientific topic should rely on more than that one book from that one politician.

We have warmed the planet by 1.1¬∞C so far yet we have seen terrible effects already from extreme storms, heat waves, and droughts.  A 4¬∞ to 5¬∞C rise would be terrible. Sea levels will rise by 2-4 meters, we will sea mass extinctions and more. The current Holoence Interglacial climate is what gage rise to civilization, coupled degrees warmer, humans can‚Äôt survive. A good way to look at the current warming is by looking at the PETM 56 million years ago, Earths temperature rose 5-8¬∞C in 20,000 years. Tropical Rainforests covered the Arctic while extreme desserts covered the equator, life even than was hard for life recovery from the extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. Than CO2 was being put in the air at 0.1 ppmv per year, now humans are pumping CO2 at 3 ppmv per year. Current CO2 levels are around 415 ppmv by 2100 that could be 1,000 ppmv similar to the PETM. \nThe debate wether humans are causing global warming is over. We know it‚Äôs real, we know humans are causing it and as a student studying the science in school now and sickens me that people deny science. The Anthropocene is here, it‚Äôs time to take care of it. Science is real, denial can‚Äôt happen. \nI live in the New York Metro Area and we are seeing more extreme coastal flooding, extreme heat waves and more hurricanes.

Just turn to Him. \n\nDid you know that God loves you very much? You are His precious creation. He knows everyhing about you, the good and the bad. God desires you to come and talk to Him and for you to find rest and peace in Him. God created you to love and for you to love him. He wants you to spend eternity in Heaven with Him. That is why he sent His Son Jesus Christ to save you. Jesus paid your sin debt by willingly dying in our place. Now that is true love! Jesus is alive...He conquered death and he is coming back very soon. Please receive Jesus Christ as your Savior today...He is the one & only Way to Heaven.\n\nWHAT TO DO:\nJust go to Jesus Christ with a humble heart, repent and put your trust in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, committing your life to Jesus.\n\nAN EXAMPLE PRAYER:\nJesus Christ, I come to you a sinner, I repent of living my life away from you and ask for your forgiveness. I believe you are the Son of God, that you went to the cross, died in my place, paying my sin debt and that you were buried & rose on the 3rd day to everlasting life. Jesus, right now, I choose to receive you as my Lord and my Savior, trusting in you alone for my salvation. I surrender my life to you and ask for your will to be done. I invite your Holy Spirit to come into my heart to make me more like you. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for filling me with the Holy Spirit and for your gift of eternal life in Heaven. Amen!\n\nNOW WHAT:\nBeing a Christian is all about relationship. You grow in your relationship with God as you spend time with Him, in your Bible, in prayer, in time of worship and praise.
