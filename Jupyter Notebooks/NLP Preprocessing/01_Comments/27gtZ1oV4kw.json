Do I think normal people should eat meat daily like they do? No. Meat should be once a week with a normal diet, dairy daily. Both preferably from local butchers or farms. Again, I grew up around farms, I'd much rather support local businesses and cut down on shipping emission. I used to eat meat once or twice a month before, and now it's maybe once or twice a week. I need to be efficient with my intake, but nobody needs meat every day. You'll get way better traction suggesting a scale down and switching to local rather than cutting it out completely.

What are your sources for any of these claims?\n\n‚Äúthere will be no turning back the clock.‚Äù There have been warmer periods in the historic past. Greenland was farmed and vineyards grew in northern England during the Medieval. The disaster was when cold returned.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no magic cold machine that will bring back or even sustain our Arctic regions.‚Äù Ever heard of the Little Ice Age? It brought famine and advancing glaciers - since then glaciers have been retreating. The next ice age is inevitable. Then we will see real catastrophic climate change.\n\n‚ÄúIf you read any of the myriad of data available, All of it suggests that the amount of co2 accumulation is beyond repair.‚Äù All? None of it does. Read the IPCC‚Äôs AR5. Even it doesn‚Äôt make such wild claims, and that‚Äôs its job.\n\n‚Äúco2 levels have steadily risen since around the industrial age.‚Äù We have little information about CO2 levels prior to the last half of the 20th century. CO2 emissions were insignificant prior to the 1940s, so if CO2 was indeed rising before then it could not have been caused by man-made CO2.\n\n‚Äúsafe to say our actions have caused this steady increase.‚Äù Our CO2 emissions have not been steady but have increased exponentially. This has had little or no effect on the rate of atmospheric CO2 rise, which has been steady for 60 years, so there is no evidence of cause and effect.\n\n‚Äúsea level rise would clearly be caused by the melting of cold solids which in turn is caused by co2 build up‚Äù Sea level rise has not accelerated as predicted. The rate of sea level rise today is the same as it was more than a century ago - long before CO2 could have been a factor.

Then the oil was running out. Then global warming. Then climate change.\n\nI've slowly learned to look at the data behind the wild claims before I believe them.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "George Applegate", "channel": "UCWil34Irypxxtl97IDX9zbQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQHFgkNsuRYBPMg8DkT6Ig_Jpd63yddPY-EicoM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
