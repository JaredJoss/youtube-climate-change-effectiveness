Both are very inefficient and will not work all the time ie, cloudy days/windless days. We would need giant battery farms. Using america as an example, the east coast has alot of trees, solar farms dont work in the shade, wind cant blow efficiently through the trees. We would need to cut down many trees for that. Also since the technology is inefficient we would need alot of these power generation types. Now just do that all over the world you get my point. Im no expert but thats common sense.

They don't need to cut down a bunch of trees to build wind farms there, because they aren't growing there anyway. Yet the wind still blows, wind farm or not. The bonus is that surrounding fields can still be used for agriculture.\n\nThe politics of it all in those areas is very strange though. Some localities embrace the wind farms, and see it as a way to stabilize their income and provide a little tax relief.

This is incredibly simplistic that CO2 equals more plant growth. If you actually bothered to look, you would've found studies that showed CO2 stops making planets grow if the planet isn't also receiving more water and nutrients from the soil. Water is especially key since CO2 is also a greenhouse gas, which makes water evaporate faster the more CO2 is in the atmosphere. And if the water is vaporizing, water vapor also helps trap in more heat, causing a feedback loop until it condenses in the clouds and causes rainfall.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "DarkPhoenix", "channel": "UCgaAH2neAyvH-YPRG6KNEQQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEG9vAiNDyWRlLUalBmQZe7KLv5hduSVnSO01s=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That is if the largest polluters in the world (India and China) would agree to take part, which they don't.\n\nSo yes, nature is not constant. There is ultimately nothing we can do about apart from adapting. We were always able to adapt in the past so with today's tech it will be a non-issue. It's not like it will be happening overnight like in Day After Tomorrow. Some people will have to relocate in the long run but it's not like earth doesn't have enough space. There are vast plains available that will warm up to comfortable temperatures. Northern countries' agriculture is already benefitting from the warmer climate in their.\n\nProtecting the environment is obviously reasonable and there are concrete measures that will make a meaningful, tangible difference. This means stopping pollution of the oceans, reducing waste in general, preserving natural habitats, stopping excessive mining, protecting animals, enforcing stricter laws on companies etc. \nProtecting the climate on the other hand is a bottomless pit because there is no way to verifiy how far you have to go to achieve a tangible difference, if possible at all. It even directly harms the environment in some cases.\nRebuilding global infrastructures, mining huge amounts of ressources and destroying large areas of natural habitats just for having solar energy and electric cars that produce less CO2 in the end is stupid, especially when we have much better alternatives available that are only discarded because they have some \"bad\" sound word in their name.\nProtecting the environment would require politics to directly crack down on corporations while offering no signifcant alternative for them to make profit. For example, you could simply ban plastic packaging or force every mining company to plant X amount of trees to compensate. Instead we get things like CO2 tax, which makes the consumer pay for the pollution upon which the actual people causing it make a profit. Or we get restrictions for ICE cars plus EV subsidies in order to make people buy new ones. You are directly creating waste by throwing away a perfectly fine car so that you can make uncompetitive companies money. All justified through an empty and unverifiable promise that requires you to believe you will save the world in 30 years.\nThe list of examples is endless.\n\r\nBottom line is protection of environment costs money, while protection of climate creates (artificially enhanced) profit and new industries.\nAll people see is CO2 CO2 CO2 and the potential consequences it will have in a few decades, while the actual destruction of nature that is going on right now is being largely ignored. Nobody cares about the actual physical implications behind technology on a GLOBAL scale. It's just about ideology and nice sounding words that appear \"good\" on a superficial, immediate level. Sure EVs are cleaner but only if you ignore everything before and after them driving in your city.\nNobody actually weighs up different alternatives against each other or examines the relative significance of certain magic numbers. There is one \"good\" way and everybody questioning it is a danger to the future of humanity.\n\nBecause climate protection is a bottomless pit with no way to verify if our measures are working, there is no end to the laws and restrictions politics can justify, which enables them to push new technologies and industries upon us at will. These are products that would otherwise not have survived in a free market and laws that would make people revolt if they weren't fooled into believing they are saving the world.\nPolitics always needs an enemy to push their agendas through fear. And there is no better enemy than one you cannot see or feel and whose potential danger is solely perceived through the media informing you of it.\nSounds familiar?", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Vini", "channel": "UCulBrKLwW3gqDy9Di8thacw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1XzTS_rlM4NdKaaiqXF6x1fWWcQbsPlunSQ5I=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The only question is, is the climate change simply natural, which if you are looking at climate tables from the last 500k years looks very convincing, or if it is man-made.\n\nIf you want to propagate a man-made climate change you have to explain how the 70.000 years of warm climate in the last 500k years came to be without humans. And even though there were high CO2 rates at these times as well, there still were no humans. If you look at these tables you will see, that it´s just about time for a climate between 3 and 5 degrees warmer than today, in a perfectly natural cycle.\n\nAnd, oh yes, btw: We not only can not but we also won´t. The can not part lies in the reality of power we consume, and the power we can produce without the use of fossil fuels. There´s a gap as deep and wide as the grand canyon. The won´t part is the reality of globalization. If we stop burning fossil fuels, they will be burned by China, Vietnam, Korea, and a bunch of African nations. Every kWh we decide not to use, will also be used by them. So we won´t change anything for the planet by chastizing ourselves, but we will lose the race and become dependent on former third-world nations.\n\nSo, don´t be mad if I hope that none of you folks ever will have a say in what we do or don´t, you would be able to hand the world to China on a golden plate while fixing nothing for the planet.", "time": "3 weeks ago (edited)", "author": "Shato Nyruami", "channel": "UCPfvObHkButv7FjyHteWVBg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTUKPH4lju37-ApXMjJKwplS6C5ICaM_FUCLcPmRA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxzSGlcGvXhhiwX0ml4AaABAg", "text": "I wonder why people talk about climate change and \"global warming\" so much, an never talk about everything we can see being sprayed into and polluting the atmosphere. \nIf plants \"prefer carbon 12,\" why does it even matter that carbon 13 levels have or are falling. Aside from using that to determine the natural or man caused effects on the carbon levels and climate.\n\nAn if there's more carbon today, then possibly even 20 million years ago. How is it possible that dinosaurs existed in those conditions. There couldn't possibly have been far more plant growth and larger mammals and animal life, if carbon levels were that far lower then we are today. Isn't this a bit contradictory from what science has always taught us.\n\nAn sure \"people ARE\" contributing to the carbon emissions and levels, but it's already proven \"how minutely little\" any average person contributes to this on a daily or throughout their life span.\nAn not only are the world's 1% wealthiest themselves using and contributing much much more to these carbon emissions. But the major production companies these individuals own and become wealthy off of. An literally the high level of metals that are found in the air, water and soil. That so called \"conspiracy theorists\" have provably pointed out for years as being \"chem-trails,\" sprayed via aircraft and aerosol injections. That now in more recent times have been admitted to, an suggested as well as tested. To be used as a way of coating the earths atmosphere and stratosphere with fine metal particulates, used to refract sunlight and uv. When realistically, this may reflect the direct sunlight.\nBut would actually \"trap in\" more carbon and heat, just as a \"greenhouse\" effect will. An that process actually \"helps\" plant life.\n\nWhy otherwise would the U.S. Government / Military, an private companies. Have been doing this discreetly for years prior, only to now openly admit to the technology and normalizing the idea of doing so. It seems as though this is exactly what years of doing something like this, would do and cause. Would be to trap and elevate carbon levels, an to artificially warm up the climate. This would also have begun right around the same time that the Government and climate experts, were suggesting and theorizing a \"mini ice age\" and that the earth would be going through a period of drastic cooling.\n\nSo the question isn't necessarily whether \"people\" are or are not influencing the carbon levels. But first what effect higher carbon levels has or will have on everything.\nAn secondly who and \"what people\" are influencing, an contributing to the carbon emissions the most.\nKind of seems like something that may have been done for years, intentionally. Specifically in order to event the climate, either to cause particular effectss with the weather and climate or to later use the excuse of the climate change. In order to roll out ideas and policies, as we're seeing today. But people don't see this as being possible, even though the technology to \"seed clouds\" and to effect weather has been around for decades. Just seems like allot of \"science\" has become agenda driven and politically motivated, more then it is \"factually scientifically based.\"\nSo far \"conspiracy theory\" has proven to be more correct, then not.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "J B", "channel": "UCf-mlruSoKj6fYQTb7tW5wg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRWCrSQIi_ucqS9PjzqoewNcQD5M0UbO742UA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'm far from a expert and am always open to new ideas an opinions. it's my goal everyday to continue to learn as much as possible. You kinda nailed where I was coming from in your comment. I also agree with all the things you mentioned those are facts for sure. I think one main issue is as you said there isnt enough data to really see the big picture and climate change over long periods. But based on what we do know the planet has had some very wild swings in climate over the last 50 million years I think it cannot be ignored that the data isnt there. that being said somthing is happening weather caused by humans or not. part of my worry is if it is a cycle that the earth must go through to continue to have a spectrum of climate like we do today.. what happens if we intervene and interrupt this cycle... on the other hand you cannot discount the fact that we are nearing the tipping of the scale when it comes to balance between human activities and nature. once that scale is tipped it will be very difficult to come back. the destruction of forests and jungles have to stop immediately or we will pay the price. the earth is healthy becuase of it's natural ability to clean the air, recycle through decomposition it's taken hundreds of millions of years to perfect and to fall in the climate we enjoy today. weather ppl believe if its caused by humans or not one thing is for sure if we do not take action now an stop destroying everything we will go through mass extinction. creating co2 at massive levels isnt great for sure but I think theres other aspects that are equal or worse causing global climate change. jungles deflect alot of the suns Ray's from reaching the ground not only do we remove them but we build cities in its place and asphalt an concrete soaks up the suns rays like crazy. a double whammy. its in all of our interests to do what's best for the planet it is the only one we have. An to be safe we should all be in agreement that it's best to do all these things not just believing that one issue is the one causing this. we know that we need the forest and jungles for clean air and to keep nature diverse yet we are letting them be cut down. we know all these things that hurt the ecosystem but it still happens.its time we all come together and figure out solutions for these things that have been done. before it's to late. if we do this at that point we will know that the earth is going through a cycle if the trend continues after we had completed that tasks. if the warming stopped then we will know it was becuae we were causing it. at that point at least we would know we did not kill our planet but was an inevitable event to happen one of  many that happen in the universe. personally I could die with peace knowing it wasent our own arrogance and ignorance.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "RapidRic", "channel": "UC2DEmDga1OVEPEakDv3N_OQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSi7OREEr5MPPSyCg3AIuVI8RpeBTAeWZlvHZemMg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

SO WE CAN RELAX IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IF WE ARE WARMING, WE ARE SIMPLY RETURNING TO THE WARMER CLIMATE OF LONG AGO!  \n\nIf these “environmental chicken-little/terrorists” don’t stop trying to deceive the world by their economic warfare complete with biological weapons of the global plan-demic being used against all sovereign free people, they will wish they did.  Law and order founded on Truth will always win in the end, and see tyrants hangs for crimes against humanity.  Yes…even you media apparatchiks will have your “Nuremberg.”  Your day before a righteous Judge is coming!  🕎❤️✝️", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Charles Foster", "channel": "UCrcZZYzmc2NAZxzzhXE51_w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSwmq9fDSdVIQNmEmype8jKX7iq1LPlmgSp_S29Lg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

For example: there Billions of Grants from the Government to turn coal power plant into biomass power plant. The funny thing is instead of burning coal, they started to burn wood chips.

Are they sure these bubbles are representative of the atmosphere at that time and not from some other process? To get atmosphere trapped in water, you'd need to splash the water and then flash freeze it before the bubbles rise. I'd be way more interested in the global COOLING that would need to happen to do that... Bubbles can be present in water from all sorts of geological / chemical processes - have they ruled these out or just ignored that possibility? Dissolved compounds and elements in water separate as it freezes. Could these air bubbles be purer because they are oxygen from the water itself? Could it be oxygen released from certain minerals/geology as it reacts within the water? What about algae or plankton or plants within the water releasing oxygen during photosynthesis after the surface of the water is frozen, hence trapping pure, clean air bubbles in this ice? Have they ruled that out too?

When your government decides to stop printing money, they will stop paying you. You might have power, but for all the other poorer people will still be paying for higher power costs. The only thing that keeps solar power worth it for you is that it is generated on location. When you try and power a whole city with all the roofs in the city, it will not balance the power load for it. Thinks of all the big cities, with apartment buildings, 10 - 20 -30 stories high the small little roof on the build will for sure power the whole building, right???? Lorenzo, come on, think how many panels are needed just to give you, your power. Then take the number of people in the city and multiply that number by the number of panels you are using. How much land or area is needed for the panels. For Roma, Florence, Milan, or Berlin, Paris, Madrid, London,...  Remember, when you start to run power line to where ever you need power, you will loss a major portion of that power that was generated depending on the distance, going from the power source to the load.  Where as we have the nuclear power modules now that can be place in locations that will easily generate all the power any city would need. Each the size of a home, as compared to how many roofs and fields filled with solar panels. Losing power all alone the power line. Do you know how much of your power is lost between your panels and your outlets? \nLook, nuclear power plants are currently - right now - supplanting coal fired power plants. Check out a that is called Thorcon. The power source is thorium, which is plentiful, thousands of years worth. Even if the whole world was using it for power, we would still have thousands of years worth. Thorium reactors can have a great side affect, it can consume nuclear waist from the old power plants to power them. Nuclear power today is way different from the old plants that had problems. Thorium with liquid salt fuel has no pressure, no water needed to cool it.

Whereas much economic gains can be made through taxations and suppression while claiming that it is all due to emissions. Plant more plants and emissions will be lowered. Common sense right? The whole of the United States was covered in an ocean and it will be again. There's a body of water underneath the United States containing more water then in the ocean if my memory serves me correctly. So, if there's a pole change, that can cause swelling and the waters will rise from below. There is nothing that mankind can do to this planet, besides blowing it to bits, that cannot be undone. And even blowing it to bits can still be self-corrected. If humans should be worrying about anything, it should be the possibility of over drilling oil affecting the lubrication of tectonic plates creating a grinding halt of land masses that would actually stop the typical activities of geomagnetism.

In geological terms this is historically low, it was near 8000ppm 650 million years ago. No one disputes this.\nBut the ice core data shows CO2 follows (ocean) temperatures, it does not lead. Warm oceans absorb less C02, as well as many other gasses that follow the temperature curve. Many others should tell CO2 is probably not leading temperature, the other is that the temperature peaks and lows precede the gas concentration curves by about 800 years, the gas curves lag, you failed to mention this important bit. The theory you try to proof here by omitting important details has been debunked decades ago. It's the Milanovic cycles that are responsible for the last 15 or so ice age cycles. C02 plays an insignificant part. And just for a second think it through, if CO2 was leading, causing warming, with according to the fear mongers in turn caused more C02, then why, does the warming stop and do we get cooling for tens of thousand if years?

So statements based on ice core \"records\" that we are undergoing the most rapid CO2 changes ever \"recorded\" are simply not able the be supported by the science.  Secondly,  during the solidification period the air included in the snow can still interact with the atmosphere,  and may migrate through the surrounding layers.

(And, on that same note, you could make an opposite point of having a hypothetical benefactor of industrial progress explain to a subsistence farmer living in an area made arid by climate change that his children should starve for said-progress.)\n\nI guess my main point was climates change all the time - human-caused or not. The system is so complex and we're only barely scratching the surface of understanding. The opportunity cost of not doing things the way humans have hasn't been well calculated either... perhaps the anthropocene (sp?) has averted some other/inverse climate change that would happen otherwise.\n\nI will concede that the main thing that alarms me is the -rate- of change that seems to be evident in some data...  but I have two issues with this: 1. Climates have changed rapidly before, though not often, and -- given, those rapid changes usually result in net decrease of the diversity of life (diversity of life being pretty easily recognized as a good thing.)\n 2. This might be due to my own ignorance, or I just havent exposed myself to the right sources yet....  but inevitably, whenever some data is presented for this rapid-anthro-change, there is always some moral or political conclusion drawn from it... which always puts me off and makes it hard to internalize the argument as a whole.    When our understanding of the processes, and our understanding of the opportunity costs in particular, is so nascent... I think it's disingenuous to not accept that the morals of the situation are most likely very much a shade of grey.\n\nIt just feels like everybody on both \"sides\" has an agenda apart from the science.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Publiconions", "channel": "UCA4Tcyy4KFRuwoCfYlq9oXg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSVCjxjBKuupA-TM11Gi_kWNGB8fbeUB4C0WNcv=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

For instance: how would it be changing right now if not for humans? Same token, how would we be different now if not for the things we do that might cause changes?

{"cid": "Ugz7jcknCnt-eqkx9wJ4AaABAg", "text": "So I have a question. According to several sources that I have found, the last ice age was about 11,500 years ago, meaning that your 20,000 year old piece of ice may have been formed when the planet was extremely cold. Does this affect your results somehow? I understand the lack of emissions and gasses, but there is plenty of historical proof saying that for as long as the earth has existed it has gone through cycles of extreme hot and extreme cold. How do we know that the earth isn't just nearing the next cycle? Are we truly destroying this planet, or are we just blaming ourselves for something the planet has always done? It also seems somewhat interesting that people have only cares about this issue for the last few decades, leading many people to believe this is nothing more than a political myth created to force us to throw money into the pockets of the rich. Did no one in the industrial age look up at the clouds of pollution and ask, \"is that good for the planet?\". I've also heard that the earth in it's natural state could only support a few million people, and that we humans have actually grown the earth instead of destroy it, so that the current population levels could survive. If that is the case then is it possible that we just continue to build the earth and not worry about being clean in our private lives?", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Michael Kane", "channel": "UCImJZiRK_zmUxLiXprL7jCA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTvvxum8EOonXLEc-gBUf1UIjZsbEDbGg3-AA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Carbon dating looks at the amount of C14 which decays over 50,000 years. I mean that's Carbon dating. I see no data here supporting causation or explaining how this creates a problem. The correlation does make sense. There is an assumption it's bad. Why is older carbon worse? I recall a documentary on the horror of plankton blooms and discovering they are not new, they're seasonal. I don't want sophistry. I want clear science. If the video is on black holes or quantum mechanics you get science. This is fluff.

{"cid": "Ugyw9bWt1QP0h6U3cS94AaABAg", "text": "We are in the most alarming situation that has ever occurred in human history, but we cannot be alarmists.  \"Alarmist\" is a bad word, because we call “alarmists” the fools and ignorants that promote Man-Made-Global-Warming.  Universities are a shame, not just the students, who maybe can be easily fooled. PhD professors and PhD researchers claiming that we all shoud go vegans because cow farts produce Global Warming and many other nonsense.  Are they idiots? Even NASA and NOOA are a real huge shame.\n\nBIG ICE AGE\nThe easiest and simplest, understandable way you can explain the BIG ICE AGE to your family, friends and to everyone you find on your way and that does not require any science background, not even basic science, is the following: \n\nMan-made-global-warming is nonsense.  CO2 is not a pollutant.  CO2 is food for plants, food for life, food for happiness.  CO2 is really good for every living thing on Earth.\n\nThe Sun manages the Earth’s climate.  The Sun creates the Earth’s climate.  \n\nAs we know, the Sun has a cycle of 11 years on average and as its activity increases, so does the number of spots on its surface.  The action of the Sun reaches the entire Solar System.  It reaches the Earth, which is mainly oceans.  There in the oceans, the Earth’s climate will finish cooking. \n\nBut the Earth has the Moon, so the action of the Sun that reaches the Earth is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.\n\nThe Moon has several cycles, of which, for now, we are interested in two of them.\nThe synodic cycle, from New Moon to New Moon and the metonic cycle. \n\nThis metonic cycle is named after Meton, a very wise guy who lived in Greece 500 years before Christ.  He realized that 235 lunations, i.e., 235 synodic cycles, were equivalent to 19 years, with an accuracy of less than two and a half hours. Very wise Meton.\n\nThis means that if on July 16, 2019 there is Full Moon, then in the year 2000 (19 years before), as well as in the year 2038 (19 years later), there is also Full Moon on July 16.\n\nThen we have a solar cycle of 11 years and we have a lunar cycle of 19 years.  If we multiply 11x19, we now have a cycle of 209 years composed of the action of the Sun and the way in which this action is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.  \n \nAt the peak of each eleven year solar cycle, its magnetic poles will exchange places. The north magnetic pole goes to the South and the south magnetic pole goes to the North.  So, the complete solar cycle is actually 22 years.\n\nAnd, then again: 22x19=418.  Two hundred years ago, the Dalton Minimum occurred and four hundred years ago the Maunder Minimum, the Little Ice Age, occurred.  As they say, we have these two trains arriving at the same time. \n\nLet's talk a little about History.  We currently use the Gregorian Calendar, a true masterpiece.  It has an error of one day every 3,333 years.  The Mayans had a slightly more precise calendar, an error of one day every 5,000 years.\nWe all understand the Gregorian Calendar.  Anyone can say how many days will it take for his next birthday or for Christmas.  The Mayan Calendar was understood only by priests.\n\nThe Mayans recorded important astronomical, political and social events on stone columns or Stelae and on the upper part of the Stela, they recorded the date of the Long Count in which the event had taken place.  The Long Count was a downward count and would have started 3,114 years before Christ, time in which, according to historians, there were no Mayans. \n\nA very clever english guy named Thompson, based solely on Stelae that recorded astronomical events, found the correlation between the Long Count and the Gregorian Calendar.  The end of the Long Count indicated the death of the Fifth Sun. \n\nThe Fifth Sun is the one we see every day flying high in the sky.  The Long Count ended on December 21, 2012.\n\nJohn Casey very accurately, almost exactly, said that the current “solar hibernation” had begun at the beginning of the year 2013.\n \nThe Mayans were dedicated to study Astronomy several centuries.  Because of the rudimentary nature of their methods, it is very difficult that they could reach the knowledge of the Long Count with complete accuracy.  I think this is a much older knowledge that the Mayans received and preserved. \n\nOf all the Grand Solar Minima that have occurred in the last millennia, none is comparable to the current one.  This one will be very much worse and very much longer. it will last hundreds of years. Maybe, thousands of years.\n\nWe will not enter in the future in a regular Grand Solar Minimun or in a Mini Ice Age.  Since December 21, 2012 we are in the biggest Grand Solar Minimun ever.  A real an long lasting BIG ICE AGE.\n\nValentina Zharkova, that brilliant and lovely lady, said last year that next Solar Cycle 25  will be very weak and will last only eight years.  This Cycle 25 will begin later this year or early 2020.  In her recently published paper she says: “Substantial temperature decrease are expected during the grand minima ... whose magnitude can not be yet predicted”.\n\nNow NASA says that Cycle 25 will be “the weakest of the past 200 years”.  Yeah, finally they noticed. Good boys. It will begin in April 2020 and will last 11 years. That is OK, but NASA has been cheating everyone and playing games with the man-made-global-warming nonsense, for too many years. \n\nSo, at the beginning of year 2024, the Solar Cycle 25 will be at it's weak peak.  From now, until 2024, the climate chaos will be growing faster and faster.  After that, we will be in a free fall, going deeper into the BIG ICE AGE.\n\nI want to analyze the effects of the other Moon cycles.  The anomalistic cycle, from apogee to apogee, wich precesses and makes a complete round in 08.75 years and the draconic cycle, that involves the ascending and descending lunar nodes, which precesses and takes 18.60 years to make a complete round. \n\nMore at: manuelesbri.com", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Manuel Esbri", "channel": "UCZM34jVSbunBJ1V4X6VfwvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRuMTMhaIy6Oy67tyRudfzZz7aQr9OIbWH02rNdg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The point being that it would be obvious to us if that particular isotope of carbon was released in modern times by a volcano like the event 55 thousand years ago that the scientist in the video referred to. Obviously that hasn’t happened. I also went on to say that it would also be known to science if lots of volcanoes where releasing that particular isotope of CO2 less violently, exactly over the period of the industrial revolution up to now and not prior to. Therefore the only significant source remaining of that particular isotope of CO2 is when human’s dig it up and burn it. \n\nI don’t know what exact amount of CO2 would be released by Yellowstone or whether it would contain the appropriate isotope of carbon and I was not referring to yellow stone anyway. If you took all fossil fuels burned in the last 150 years from all human sources not just cars then I do believe it would be significantly more than the specific activity of not just any volcano but specifically ones that are in contact with a large reserve of some kind of fossil fuel. The implication by the scientist seemed to be that this was not common. Not all volcanic eruptions are going to be in contact with significant reserves of fossil fuels and therefore won’t release significant amounts of that particular isotope of carbon into the air. So again we are left with humans being the only mechanism which can explain the observed significant increase of this particular isotope in the atmosphere.", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Yvonne Reed", "channel": "UCf-wSYI2P6F3er82jooRrZA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSiPLZ8wiIsU0x5xsncbN5r34a5hSoG5o-qMQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The last big study, Powell study in 2019 gave the figure of consensus among scientists on climate change as 100%. I only say 99% out of consideration that there must be a handful of quack scientists who would say otherwise. So although I might be severely over-representing them I like 99% better as a conservative number. \n\nAlso I thought it went without saying that when we use words scientists we meant climate scientists, the figure is for them. So yeah according to Powell study 100% of climate scientists agree on this issue. Again research before arguing on points. You seem to lack a lot of knowledge if you didn't even know of well known studies like these. \n\nAlso, yes no article is absolutely certain. That's why you need to check articles background. The sources I sent you, they are the best of the best. Certainly better than your rag tag newspaper article from 30 years back. Practice what you preach kid. 1 article can be wrong and yes one can ignore it, but a 1000 studies all pointing to the same conclusion. Now if you don't accept that results then you are just in denial, unwilling to accept reality. \n\nAs I said clearly, you are the one on the wrong side of facts. You don't have any evidence for your point of view, and you certainly have done zero research. Finally you are unwilling to accept the opinion of the absolute majority of experts in this very field who claim otherwise and have literally thousands of studies proving their claim. \n\nThe question isn't what's the truth. We have pretty much established that. The question is why are you so unwilling to accept it? Are you terrified by the idea that we might be destroying our planet? Well then ignoring the threat is really the worst way to go about it. Don't act like a little kid, ignoring problems doesn't make them go away. Being so terrified of the facts that you start to deny reality is not really something adults should do. Nobody is asking you to finance the entire solution. You don't even need to shell out any cash.

Very expensive and unreliable source of green energy; certainly NOT in the future plans. They’re also are landscape “killers” \nLook at Wolfe Island near Kingston on the St. Laurence seaway, a jewel, well, was. They are not green to make and in many cases, the damaged parts etc, end up in landfills.

Why do we not hear about this technology when the left talk about renewable energy? The much better alternative, albeit very expensive and has limitation of where it can be installed but much better than previous methods.??\r\nFurthermore, as far as crude oil is concerned, it will be around for a lonnng time as there are over 6000 by-products derived from oil.

{"cid": "UgyjiCMA46aLD2hC-CB4AaABAg", "text": "It would be interesting to know what happened in the Arctic during the 10,800 BCE abrupt climate change. We know there were two ice sheets - smaller Cordilleran and bigger Laurentide on North America. The Laurentide perhaps 3 - 4 km thick at some places. \r\n\r\nThere was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.\r\n\r\nAdjusted quote: \"Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.\"\r\n\r\nIf interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ∼9% of world terrestrial biomass on ∼10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km² in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps CO2 released by burning of ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. \r\n\r\nThere is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?\r\n\r\nOne simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. \r\n\r\nRecent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. \r\n\r\nThe paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w\r\n\r\nImpact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. \r\n\r\nThere are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // \r\n\r\nIt is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible \"string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker–Levy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000 m in diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth.

Our CO2 dump is definitely unprecedent. But correlation isn't causation (first lesson in science). When you hear scientists saying this is unprecedent, they're talking about CO2 ppm.  CO2 only makes up 5% of our greenhouse gases, 0.04% of the atmosphere is CO2, and humans only make up a small percentage of that CO2. I'm going to attach a graph of Co2 and temperature for millions of years. CO2 isn't the control knob for the earth's temperature. The Triassic period had 1/4th the amount of co2, and was 6 degrees hotter for over 100 million years. We had eras with twice the CO2 while the climate was much colder for millions of years. And our warming trend started before any meaningful CO2 emissions. \n\nP.s\n\nThose aren't negative signs, there just dashes. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=co2+and+temperature+through+millions+of+years&client=ms-android-bell-ca&prmd=ivn&sxsrf=ALeKk02nqxeC9aOv3c02x6ar3VH8SoczpQ:1596709531170&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiks6jDrobrAhUwU98KHZxCBrwQ_AUoAXoECA0QAQ&biw=360&bih=560#imgrc=Iwwg-mjbT6QliM", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Sticky_Gaming", "channel": "UC1g9_OWbb_y72No6cDsfDYw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/GruXPLX1xINBALKWunggE9AWn2UPoS5EUaE0LG5rZJD8J9QUXQ6dmdES3CHi6WBaea2yof458w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Furthermore I am pretty sure that we cannot accurately know the global temperature and CO2 concentration past a few tens of millions of years because where we get the CO2 atmospheric concentration is from the antartic ice which only came into existance a few million years ago. And a 1 degree C increase in 100 years IS unprecedented because usually it takes a few hundred to a few thousand years for the earth to increase 1 degree. Also the website where that graph is found on is not reliable (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/watts-up-with-that/).

Human CO2 is a tiny % of CO2 emissions. The oceans contain 37,400 billion tons (GT) of suspended carbon, land biomass has 2000-3000 GT. The atpmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 and humans contribute only 6 GT additional load on this balance. We have a good cycle. More co2 equals more plants, and more plants equal more co2 absorption. You can have an idea of earth's temperature 100+ million years ago by the studying of indirect clues, the chemical and structural signatures of rocks, fossils, and crystals, ocean sediments, fossilized reefs, tree rings... \n\nHere's a quote from your own link : \n\n\" Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rose by around 20 parts per million over the 7 decades from 1880­–1950, while the temperature increased by an average of 0.04° C per decade.\n\nOver the next 7 decades, however, carbon dioxide climbed nearly 100 ppm (5 times as fast!). . . . At the same time, the rate of warming averaged 0.14° C per decade.\"\n\nWarning trend started in 1910, but we didn't receive a meaningful CO2 dump until 1950. So no, correlation isn't causation, there isn't even a correlation. And did you even know, increased co2 always follows a warmer Earth, not the other way around?

What you're actually doing is putting your trust into the organisations they're working for. An experts opinion is worth nothing if he's not free to say what he wants. Pro tip: Only give retired experts the time of day and even then be weary of the fact that they might be under pressure. \n\nEveryone basically accepts that corporately funded politicians can't be trusted.

The reason for the focus on vaccines is a purely monetary one. There is absolutely no way that any pharmaceutical companies would release any information that would suggest  successful treatment from an existing patent free drug. I-mectn has shown enormous promise in both treatment and prevention of this virus. That information is being actively surpressed for obvious reasons.

Humans aren't equal because only free will doesn't exist. They are determined by their mindsets, opinions, thoughts and ideas therefore it's impossible to archive a true equality.

{"cid": "UgyrYpNAQuVCHeSY8o54AaABAg", "text": "Climate change is absolutely real. CO2 used to be so much higher and climate changed in the past before humans even existed. Toxic pollution is indeed bad for the environment and human health. However, we do not know if more CO2 or less CO2 is better. We do not know if higher temperature or lower temperature is better. Why? Because we cannot identify what is the ideal amout of CO2 in the atmosphere and what is the ideal average temperature should be. The biggest contributor by far in increasing or decreasing earth's temperature is the SUN. You've heard of the SUN right? That big ball of hot plasma that is the main source of energy and heat of the earth? Yes, that one. Yet non of the computer models include the variations in the energy output of the SUN. Conincidentally, climate change corresponnds to the Sun's output. I totally agree that humans must take care of the environment, but how do we know where to start if we cannot definitively say what the end goal is? What is the CORRECT amount of CO2 in the atmosphere? What is the CORRECT temperature of the earth should be? What if the earth actually need more CO2 and nations start lowering CO2 output and actually cause more damage? We wouldn't know unless we identify the CORRECT numbers first before we try anything. What's worse is that we are in the beginning phase of the Maunder Minimum which the sun's output is low which was the main reason for the mini Ice Age 400 years ago, when winter started earlier and lasted longer which when the inevitable happens in the very near future can cause global food  shortage due to shorter farming season. If we started making an effort to lower Earth's temperature, it would only add to the devastating effect of the upcoming mini Ice age. But then, it's not like our puny efforts either to increase or decrease CO2 will have any significant effect on climate change anyway.

There is also proof that the planet has had at least 5 ice ages. We are currently in one (if the poles have ice it's an ice age). Antarctica has been a near tropical island in the past. Just because the ice caps melt doesn't mean the sea level is going to go up dramatically, global humidity on the other hand might be a different story. \n\nThese are the same people that will talk about evolution, forgetting that you need an ever changing environment to adapt to in order to evolve. In our planning stage we need to acknowledge that things will constantly change . So instead of assuming that the temperature/air composition ratios/sea level/humidity/inhabitable parts of the planet will stay the same indefinitely  (then, when it does change, we are somehow to blame) and set things up for ease of adaptation. Cities like Amsterdam and New Orleans come to mind, as examples of poor planning, by going against the current reality and making a coastal city that is below sea level. It's not as if they were on high ground and then global warming caused a land slide and sea level change. They decided to build cities in swamps. (Even then, they are still there, so where is this sea level rise that has been threatened for so long).\n\nScience has us seeking some sort of a  \"place of completion and finality\" that we are trying to preserve (trying to keep the climate the same, \"curing\" what could be adaptations under the assumption they are abnormalities/deformations/genetic disorders/diseases), but they are really making us devolve.

Better to know the scientific truth so that policy makers can understand how much they need to prepare. Yes, climate is changing but not necessarily due to man-made CO2 emissions. A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as rain in the mid-latitudes and as snow in the high latitudes. \n\nIn new ice age theory, the snow accumulates into advancing glaciers. Glaciers are always melting but if the extra snowfall decreases then the glaciers retreat and the world enters an interglacial.\n\nThe snowfall of Antarctica has increased by 10% in the last 200 years which indicates the planet is slowly entering the 100,000-year cycle.\n\nCO2 is a default mechanism from out-dated ice age theory.

The best way I could describe it is you are doing the thing that you are complaining about. You ask questions then when people respond you tell them they aren't staying on topic or answering your questions. But you wont actually cover what they are saying. I made my point and  I'm not asking you to respond. You can choose to either consider what I said or ignore it.\n\nAs for your previous conversations it sounds like you are asking how global warming leads to climate change.... that is climate change. That's like asking \"how does walking lead to travel?\". If you want to understand the mechanism of how temperature differences create weather patterns then you should learn about how weather works. If you're asking how weather patterns lead to doomsday situations, that all depends on what you call doomsday. If you don't care that natural habitats are being destroyed due to weather and temperature changes then it's not an issue. If you don't think flooding due to rising seas is a problem the  it's not an issue. If you think extreme weather patterns leading to fires, drought, and deaths is not an issue then it's nothing to worry about. If you think tornadoes and hurricanes caused by fluctuating temperatures aren't a problem then things are fine. If you think air pollution is ok then that's cool. If you don't mind thinning ozone layers leading to higher UV light penetration and heat is all good then that's your choice. If you do think any of these things are potential issues then your time would be best used trying to figure out what we CAN do, rather than arguing with people on YouTube comments.\n\nAnd yes, I know I said ozone and pollution and that those aren't directly related to C02. But that doesn't matter because once you start caring about nature you start trying to figure out what's going on in the big picture. And the big picture is the things that cause C02 are also adding a lot of other things in our environment. We are currently the most destructive thing on the planet. Unless we're comparing ourselves to asteroids we're doing a pretty good job of ruining our own home. We cant even drink our own water or eat fish or even breath without having to make sure we aren't poisoning ourselves in the process.

Cold air from the sea mixing with hot air from the ground makes it that you always have wind coming from the ocean. Those summer dry thunderstorms?

Everyone was arguing in the comments and indeed the scientists weren't able to answer properly... but few people realised it was because the question itself based on a false assumption. It was the assumption that there are \"kinds\" of animals then asking how one \"kind\" switches to another \"kind\" like from dog to cat.

If you agree that heat melts ice then you can't deny that it will turn to water. This water contributes loss of animal habitats who live on ice at the poles as well as rising sea levels which affects coastal cities. This isn't an opinion because it's already happening. However because we haven't lost all the ice yet, the full damages are yet to occure. So there are still predictions being made or as you say \"opinions\" however they are based by looking at what is happening now and seeing where things are going in the future. Just as how your life is a pretty good indication of the future.\n\nThink of it more as a ship with a hole in the hull. Currently we've damaged the hull with our heat. We are still afloat, but if you calculate the rate at which we're burning the hole larger and the rate at which the water is coming in then we can have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen... it's an opinion how fast we are sinking but it's not an opinion that we are.\n\nSo I explained to you scientific facts that we are losing our polar ice caps and that we have rising sea levels. Those are 2 issues.... but there are many. In many parts of the world in recent times we've broken heat wave records that have killed people and caused droughts. Just a few weeks ago here in canada we broke heat records. This is a fact.\n\nRising temperatures also affects the balance of animal life for migratory animals as their life cycles and patterns are based on environmental temperature. This affects sea life as well for example whales who migrate. The reproduction  of many animals are also directly based on temperature. Changing the oceanic temperature also affects the delicate balance of microorganisms which has larger impacts to other life.\n\nI've just stated facts of floods, death, and loss of animal habitats due to warming temperatures.\n\nThese things are happening right now.\n\nAlso I'm mostly trying to ascertain what your thought process is by all these questions to you so that I can find a way in. Also to show you that by applying logic you can see for yourself how everything is interconnected. You can't separate one thing from another.\n\nIn simple terms... everything on our planet is the way it is because the different forces and patterns have found a balance.

{"cid": "UgxQb_B4NGyAJOwu2gp4AaABAg", "text": "There is a difference between global warming and climate change. A lot of people tend to think they're the same thing but they aren't. Global warming is a term popularized by former presidential nominee al gore and has been used primarily to make money off of people by making all these new \"green\" technologies that are supposed to be better for the world but in reality have been shown to cause even more carbon emissions from the processes to make and ship them that its almost irrelevant to use them. On top of that most people who don't have scientific degrees in these subjects will just blindly follow what they say just because they're \"smarter\" then you and me. All these scientist for those who are unaware are paid by your government to continuously spout these lies about using \"green\" technology to better the planet at the same time using it to fear monger people who don't believe in it by making them out be unintelligent morons who have no idea what they're talking about. And yet just a simple search in the record books can show you that, yes, the world may be getting hotter over the course of a a few decades but it's still not as hot as it was close to just a hundred years ago, when emissions were almost non existent when compared to today. Around a hundred years ago were the hottest recorded temperatures the earth has yet to see but you don't see anyone bring that little tid bit up. Another thing these scientist are paid to lie about us the amount of emissions truly required to do ANY real damage to the world. You would have to multiply the carbon emissions we currently put out over twenty times to truly see a small amount of natural damage done, because by that point the air would almost be toxic which wouldn't be what people are currently worried about. People are worried about the ocean tising a few inches which will change year in and year out because we have no true control over whether the ice wants to melt or not, which by the way we have recently had more ice being developed over thr past few years then weve previously had recorded in the past few decades but they won't tell you that either. They even go so far as to doctor images to make it believable, and if you try to travel that for North or south you will be forced by government officials to turn around because they don't want their lies being found out. The one and only reason our planet will ever truly significantly rise in temperature is the sun, which is so far beyond our control its not even funny. What most of you don't realize is that if a single violent solar flare cones towards us, we are screwed beyond repair. Electricity would be nonexistent, all satellite technologies would be destroyed, along with whatever would be destroyed from or ozone truly being completely wiped out. That's a worst case scenario, a less scenario is our sun just rises in temperature which naturally cause the temperature of the earth to rise, which is what is really happening to the planet. The sun rises in falls in temperature at an uncontrollable, and unpredictable rate. This is the real reason our planet goes through a natural process of change called climate change. Man's miniscule c02 emissions well never be enough to cause our ozone to be destroyed, even if we tried. Some of you may not want hear it but that's the real truth behind global warming and climate change but if you want to be mad because I spoke the truth then that is on you. If you chose to be a blind little sheeple believing everything uncle Sam and his pawns tell you then that is on you being willingly ignorant and selfish to the facts of the situation. But if you see the truth, then let it be something that frees you from the chains that the deep state wants to shackle you with, ley it be one less thing you have to worry about and enjoy your life more knowing so.

Better to know the scientific truth so that policy makers can understand how much they need to prepare. Yes, climate is changing but not necessarily due to man-made CO2 emissions. A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as rain in the mid-latitudes and as snow in the high latitudes. \n\nIn new ice age theory, the snow accumulates into advancing glaciers. Glaciers are always melting but if the extra snowfall decreases then the glaciers retreat and the world enters an interglacial.\n\nThe snowfall of Antarctica has increased by 10% in the last 200 years which indicates the planet is slowly entering the 100,000-year cycle.\n\nCO2 is a default mechanism from out-dated ice age theory.

Before banning fossil fuels the science community needs to test this new idea which is an alternative to CO2.\nThere's another explanation for northern hemisphere extreme weather. Better to know the scientific truth so that policy makers can understand how much they need to prepare. Yes, climate is changing but not necessarily due to man-made CO2 emissions. A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as rain in the mid-latitudes and as snow in the high latitudes. \n\nIn new ice age theory, the snow accumulates into advancing glaciers. Glaciers are always melting but if the extra snowfall decreases then the glaciers retreat and the world enters an interglacial.\n\nThe snowfall of Antarctica has increased by 10% in the last 200 years which indicates the planet is slowly entering the 100,000-year cycle.\n\nCO2 is a default mechanism from out-dated ice age theory. This is what Arrhenius based his research on and Greta bases her alarmism on.\n\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1308437/dark-matter-news-scientist-moon-core-theory-newton-einstein", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Alan Lowey", "channel": "UCmmC6fSiWvS-IieXl0T385Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZuujH0qa0qm1wHCZu_jYRpD2BVht9q4GJtQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

No evidence of oceans rising, no evidence of the ice land masses melting. None of it has been proven, it’s just a mainstream narrative that everyone believes. This accomplishes many things for the world governments, just like this false pandemic. They get to change our lives, force farmers into the cities.

Let that sink in and why the male population is just a bunch of scared vaginas running around with their masks on. All of this should sound insane to you and you should 100% not believe me.

Before banning fossil fuels the science community needs to test this new idea which is an alternative to CO2.\nThere's another explanation for northern hemisphere extreme weather. Better to know the scientific truth so that policy makers can understand how much they need to prepare. Yes, climate is changing but not necessarily due to man-made CO2 emissions. A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as rain in the mid-latitudes and as snow in the high latitudes. \n\nIn new ice age theory, the snow accumulates into advancing glaciers. Glaciers are always melting but if the extra snowfall decreases then the glaciers retreat and the world enters an interglacial.\n\nThe snowfall of Antarctica has increased by 10% in the last 200 years which indicates the planet is slowly entering the 100,000-year cycle.\n\nCO2 is a default mechanism from out-dated ice age theory. This is what Arrhenius based his research on and Greta bases her alarmism on.\n\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1308437/dark-matter-news-scientist-moon-core-theory-newton-einstein", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Alan Lowey", "channel": "UCmmC6fSiWvS-IieXl0T385Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZuujH0qa0qm1wHCZu_jYRpD2BVht9q4GJtQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyTUC8lHWdnAHVr-iZ4AaABAg", "text": "Does anyone claim ancient climate change Is NOT real.\"  As I understand it, ancient climate change was natural, not man made. The evidence in ancient ice is that climate change is cyclical. Warming periods are followed by cooling periods. Temperature trends rapidly upward for a while, slows and then cools. Temperature trends rapidly lower, slows and then warms. The duration of climate cycles in the record extends from two years (biennial oscillation) to arguably 400,000 years (Marine Isotope Stage 11). The shape of the temperature curves are approximately sinusoidal.\n\nThe conventional modern paradigm is: 1) natural climate cycles cannot account for the temperature record since the beginning of the industrial period. 2) climate is warming by trending upward. 3) mankind is causing the upward trend. 4) natural cycles are no longer the dominant cause of climate change.\n\nSome people claim that global temperature seems to be trending upward but is actually in the upward part of a natural cycle and will reverse direction at some time in the future. These people are called \"climate deniers\" or \"climate-change deniers\". The term \"denier\" associates such people with \"Holocaust deniers\".\n\n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Isotope_Stage_11\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_event\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_event#/media/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png \n\nBond, G and others, 2001.

URL: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/mixing.html\nA more important issue is the question: How much CO2 is needed in the atmosphere for land plants to survive on Earth? About 150 parts per million (ppm). During the last glacial maximum the level dropped to about 180 ppm. The pre-industrial level has been estimated at 280 ppm. Now the level is about 415 ppm. Still, much lower than during the Eocene, a warm period 50 million years ago, estimated at 2000 ppm. And much lower than horticulturalists use to grow plants in greenhouses, 1500 ppm.\nURL: http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-077.htm\n\nThere are several reasons why CO2 levels have dropped during geological time. Sequestration by both land plants (coal) and by microscopic sea animals in the form of limestone. Most of the Earth's CO2 is locked up in rocks.\n\nUntil humans began to emit CO2 in large amounts, the Earth was well on its way to reduction of CO2 to below 150 ppm, perhaps during the next continental glaciation. If so, then land plants and the animals that feed on land plants would become extinct. Possibly, humans will prevent CO2 from ever dropping below the level to sustain life on Earth.\nA line of research you might be interested in is how land plants have adapted to carbon dioxide starvation. \n\nQuote: \"The evolutionary process that changed C3 plants into C4 species has occurred not once but at least 66 times in the past 35 million years. This evolutionary step led to enhanced photosynthetic performance and increased water- and nitrogen-use efficiency....As a result, C4 plants have twice as the photosynthetic capacity as C3 plants and can cope with higher temperatures, less water, and available nitrogen.\"\n\nhttps://www.thoughtco.com/c3-c4-cam-plants-processes-172693", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Badger", "channel": "UCR-JIdhjRa9zYK-LodxG-Ng", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTr15SjWN9Y8amUSZKu96sl_oWcW-uZHfmWdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We are currently in a full blown ice age, but in what is called an interglacial period. This ice age has existed for several million years. \n\nThe little ice age was from (depending on what you use to define it) 200 ad to 1910 ad. For example, glaciers in Canada indicate that the little ice age did not end until the early 1900's. Other use metrics that say it ended in 1600. Still others say mid 1800's. Personally, I always attributed it to the end of the last grand solar minimum in the 1800's when the temperature dropped .5°c in 30 year, then began our current recovery. So yes, the ice age (full blown) is normal temperature. And yes, our current temperature is not normal for a full blown ice age, but thats the way things are when your in an interglacial period. AND in a funny kind of a way our temperature is not right for this part of this interglacial period, as we are colder than we should be. \n\nFrom the beginning of the little ice age to the bottom of it in the 1600's, the temperature fell by 3°c. Since then it has recovered by about 1.5-1.8°c. The position of our orbit, means we are getting more energy from the sun than is leaving due to the fact that we are recovering from that little ice age. During the little ice age, glaciers expanded world wide (we know this from history and from glacial deposits. The oceans fell slightly. We know this because there are places all over the world where there was building built on the sea that are now, in some cases, miles inland. As the ice melts the sea rises again.\n\nPlease try to imagine how much energy is being stored in the water when billions of tons of ice melt every year and become ocean temperature. Imagine what it does to the earths average temperature when you take billions of ice from below freezing and warm turn it into oceans.

A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as rain in the mid-latitudes and as snow in the high latitudes. \n\nIn new ice age theory, the snow accumulates into advancing glaciers.

Before banning fossil fuels the science community needs to test this new idea which is an alternative to CO2.\nThere's another explanation for northern hemisphere extreme weather. Better to know the scientific truth so that policy makers can understand how much they need to prepare. Yes, climate is changing but not necessarily due to man-made CO2 emissions. A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as rain in the mid-latitudes and as snow in the high latitudes. \n\nIn new ice age theory, the snow accumulates into advancing glaciers. Glaciers are always melting but if the extra snowfall decreases then the glaciers retreat and the world enters an interglacial.\n\nThe snowfall of Antarctica has increased by 10% in the last 200 years which indicates the planet is slowly entering the 100,000-year cycle.\n\nCO2 is a default mechanism from out-dated ice age theory. This is what Arrhenius based his research on and Greta bases her alarmism on.\n\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1308437/dark-matter-news-scientist-moon-core-theory-newton-einstein", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Alan Lowey", "channel": "UCmmC6fSiWvS-IieXl0T385Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZuujH0qa0qm1wHCZu_jYRpD2BVht9q4GJtQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The only source of power that could realistically replace fossil fuels is nuclear power.  Either nuclear fusion or nuclear fission.   Nuclear fusion would be the best option, but it may be a long time before that technology can be developed.  Nuclear fission is already something that can be done, but we still need to solve problems such as dealing nuclear waste.  Either we need cleaner nuclear power plants that don't produce it, or we need a better way to dispose of it.  Once that issue is sorted out, we could build enough nuclear power plants to provide all of our energy needs.  That would not only not bankrupt our economy, it would likely stimulate it.  All while being much friendlier to the environment.  Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power are useful in some cases.  They work well in some specific locations, but they cannot provide more than a small fraction of our energy needs.  So the people proposing replacing fossil fuels with them are either out of their minds, or are not serious about solving the problem.  Likely their agenda is political in nature rather than environmental.

I'm suggesting doing something that could actually work.  Not to waste trillions of dollars on something that can't possibly work.   And I'm in no way underestimating what solar can do.  It can work rather well in a few small cases.  But it cannot even come close to providing for our nation's or any other nation's energy needs.  Try doing rooftop solar in New York City and tell me how that works.  It's a completely moronic idea.  Nuclear works anywhere, and natural gas is cheaper and cleaner than any other fossil fuel.  So it's definitely an improvement.  Officials are probably against solar because it's expensive to implement, and doesn't produce much power.  They actually care if a proposed solution works.\n\nThe reason people like fossil fuels has nothing to do with politics.  Fossil fuels are a cheap and abundant energy source which can be implemented with existing technology.  A big reason for that is the high energy density of fuels like gasoline.  Because of these advantages, fossil fuels are very difficult to replace.  An alternative has to provide a similar amount of power at a similar price.  And nuclear power is the only option available to us that even comes close.  We simply don't have the ability to produce the required power any other way.

No. everyone's always so quick to point out that carbon dioxide is higher than it ever has been since humans have been alive blah blah blah. but bail to mention that carbon dioxide levels have been as high as 4,000 parts per million and 7,000 parts per million in the past and a life on the planet still existed. And one of those times was the Cambrian explosion where the greatest explosion of life and biodiversity that has ever been known to happen on this planet occurred. should you be buying property on the coast and building buildings next to the water well.. idiots do what idiots do. I'm just so tired of the hysteria. Thankfully this video was lacking in most the hysterical department but still fails to even acknowledge that yes it's been enormously higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the past and there was an enormous amount of life on the planet. I am absolutely sure that if dumb dinosaurs and life in general back then survived that the most intelligence species to ever evolve that we know of on this planet will survive. So for all the hysterical out there you will get so much more done If you stop with all the hysterics because all it does is turn normal rational people off.

But meat doesn't have to be cheap af for example. You don't have to eat your prime beef every day. You don't have to buy a new iPhone each year. You don't have to consume without limit. We have to change our entire economical structure. It should be more beneficial to produce more sustainable products... but right now our system works on annual cycles for every product. For example: A car from 1955 works quite well even in 2020 while a car from 1995 is basically trash. That's unnecessary waste of materials and energy. But our economics works on growth alone... you have to produce more and more, while the consumers have to buy more and more... that's stupid. We could reduce our CO2 emissions drastically by just changing that. Just imagine you could buy a car for life. So you buy a car ONCE in your lifetime. Sure it's more expensive but you don't have to buy one ever again, which is cheaper on the long run. Just imagine a car could be an investion like real estate. We have to come back to quality over quantity imo. That doesn't mean that you have less money in your wallet. \nBut that limitless consumerism has to stop anywhere soon. We should rather look for the things we really need rather to look for what we want. \nFor example: I want a new iPhone... but the old one is still workin although it's held together by gaffer's tape and good hope... so I don't buy a new iPhone. I buy clothes if I need new ones, because my old ones get too many holes. I buy new things if the old ones are broken and I would pay a hell a lot more for new things that \"never\" brake.\nWe have to reduce our waste of materials and energy... that's it.

Maybe he means literal annihilation, but its probably hyperbole which will make it sound worse; its sort of important for an issue that doesn't seem to really get much action. Sure it won't destroy the planet, but it will: increase drought and heat wave and wildfire frequency and intensity, increase natural disaster frequency and intensity, disrupt the jetstream (huge environmental effects), make it harder to live in developing countries and be poor, make food and water more scarce, reduce marine food availability, flood coastal land (where most people tend to live) leading to huge exoduses and a figurative flood of immigrants and overall chaos across the world (longer-term effect), and of course kill entire ecosystems (like the coral reefs, already bleaching) and create a new mass extinction. This will spiral on and on even if CO2 is reduced from: reduced ice to reflect sun rays, melting of permafrost containing copious amounts of methane (much much worse than CO2), and several more factors. Life on earth is very fragile to temperature changes, sure life continued beyond climate changes, but it will surely kill many species and individual organisms (or make it harder to survive) and it can be stopped since its entirely humanity's fault, so why don't we? Economic impact you say? Who cares, some things are more important than the economy, like keeping nature intact and stable. Best things we can do is: abandon fossil fuels regardless of economic impact and reduce the power of the oil rich, build lots of nuclear plants since they are very efficient and don't require much land though they aren't renewable and create waste, fund research into thorium nuclear power (much better than uranium), and heavily fund research into CO2 removal and nuclear fusion, oh and never vote for people funded by the oil rich and deny basic science, and vote for people who are serious about climate change action. The problem is climate change isn't right in people's faces, and the oil companies fund the people who can actually get things done (so nothing gets done); we really just need to treat this as one of the most important issues to address globally because it threatens the stability of the current status quo of society AND nature.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Stabino Jablonski", "channel": "UCTNw24SMLGSRIRRg9yIlrPg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTuFz1GUdxrENWOaj79vcdzqnA8PdEM4ppvdm1fbQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Thorium can't be used for nuclear weapons, is way more plentiful than uranium or plutonium and works best in a hot vat of molten salt. That last part makes meltdowns virtually impossible - if the vat gets too hot, the bottom will melt and the whole system will fall into a pool of water cooling it down, solidifying the salt and containing the radiation. This happens without human interaction. Also, if the vat isn't being heated by an outside source, it will cool down and solidify. Nuclear waste will still be a big problem, but there's a lot more time to solve that problem than to solve the greenhouse effect. \nElectric vehicles also have some big down sides: they take a long time to charge (30+ minutes in stead of 5 to fill a tank) and the batteries wear out, are difficult to make and difficult to recycle. \nAs for bio fuel, progress is being made on growing algae and processing them into bio fuel.

It's not just the fact that humans have to deal with warmer temperatures, its about mass extinctions of animals and plants and mass displacement of giant human populations due to certain areas becoming uninhabitable or even being under water. People think the migration of refugees into Europe and the USA is a problem now? That is nothing. There will be several orders of magnitude more people moving from equatorial/arid/coastal regions because these areas will no longer be habitable. It's already starting to happen. And again, if people think the political unrest caused by these migrations is a problem now, it will be 50 times worse if we dont take action as soon as posdible.

It was literally just trapped air from that timeline, this is amazing science and what they're discovering from this is fascinating- no need to try discrediting it so much, there's a reason people have their entire lives dedicated to these fields of investigation.

{"cid": "Ugzqa_Fs0CVyKRa_nYh4AaABAg", "text": "Kids, when you see someone gathering evidence to support their theory, that's not science. That's pseudoscience! Science works the other way around. You come up with a theory and try really hard to find evidence to the contrary. 20,000 years ago the earth was in the middle of an ICE AGE which ended 12,500 years ago. We didn't cause that global warming.\n\n\nLET'S ALL UNITE AGAINST POLLUTION ALL OVER THE WORLD\n\n1. Our species went through multiple ice ages and global warmings. The current global warming started approximately 12,000 years ago. That's how the last ice age ended and the current geological period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won't last forever. Interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years. So, we have between 8,000 and 48,000 years until the next ice age.\n\n2. The rate at which the sea level is rising now is much lower compared to how it rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago – a period in which the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the Early Holocene Sea Level Rise if you want to learn more.\n\n3. The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the \"stability\" of the climate, you might want to look up:\n– The 8.2 Kiloyear Event\n– The Little Ice Age\n– The Year Without a Summer (1816)\n\n4. Chaos Theory tells us why the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum, for example – https://youtu.be/U39RMUzCjiU. No one can predict the climate.\n\n5. Computer simulations of chaotic systems have no predictive value because the initial conditions can never be measured with sufficient accuracy. Such simulations only generate pretty pictures on a screen. Again, no one can predict the behavior of chaotic systems. Because – Chaos Theory!\n\n6. Compared to water, CO₂ plays an insignificant role in the global greenhouse effect. Because – and I'm not making this up – 95% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor. \n\n7. CO₂ is not a pollutant. CO₂ is plant food. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis – a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO₂ and water. Without CO₂ plants die. Without plants, we die. CO₂ is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO₂ is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery. There are real pollutants out there we should be worried about and CO₂ is not one of them.\n\n8. Compared to astronomical factors like solar activity or the Milankovitch Cycles or terrestrial factors like volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We're not that significant.\n\n9. This may came as a shock to you, but we're actually in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation – the Quaternary Glaciation – look it up!\n\n10.  There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of anthropogenic climate change. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who essentially said Global Warming is pseudoscience – https://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0. Freeman Dyson said that \"Climate Change predictions are absurd\" – https://youtu.be/fmy0tXcNTPs Wikipedia has a List of scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming, but it only contains the names of those scientists \"who have their own Wikipedia article.\" Keep in mind that science doesn't work by consensus. Science isn't a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:\n\n“Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.”", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", "channel": "UCtvj8-yqUr9qHpRZLXO5V1g", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1bOB9AnngP3Pl3u1PVE_lXsj_UmDBvRxF8InHKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
