I don't see how a 1-2°C rise over 100 yrs is going to make ANY matter to anything!  Maybe someone willing to do the math would calculate, given the amount of ice there is on the planet, just how long it would take to actually melt all of it... even if the antarctic would rise in temperature so that it was, on the average, 33°F there instead of -37°F!  How many hundreds, or possibly, thousands of yrs would it have to average 33°F to melt it all!?  I just wanted to say that this is a problem that only someone well versed in physics and math could even come close to 'solving'.  You have to be able to build an equation based on the amount of standing ice on the planet and the rise in average temperature and then relate that to a positive ice loss.  The amount of ice loss has to be more than the amount of water that refreezes.  Once you get to this temperature now you can calculate the temperature necessary to cause a loss that would result in the total loss of ice in a time span that you wish to see it all gone.  If you want it to all be gone in 10-20 yrs then I think we could be looking at temperatures far greater than man could even survive mainly from the loss of agriculture.

I think you should know we don't have just one study demonstrating that climate change is occurring due to human sources, but thousands, possibly millions. We also have predictions. Tons of them. There are studies that have accurately predicted the temperature increases in the troposphere and decreases in the stratosphere due to greenhouse gas emissions. We have studies accurately quantifying the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, a major feedback to CO2 warming. We have studies quantifying and predicting ice loss in both polar regions and in mountain glaciers. We have studies quantifying the amount of heat stored in the ocean as well as the uptake of CO2, a major cause of decreases in ocean oxygen content and ocean acidification, respectively. We even have studies demonstrating predicting that CO2 does act as a \"greening\" agent for plant biomass, although that effect will likely diminish in the future and has some negative effect such as reduced nutrient concentration in food plants.\n\nIf you can think of it, some scientist has likely made an entire career of studying it. It's a shame you don't think climatology or atmospheric science isn't interesting enough to read about.

The sun goes through cycles from solar minimums to solar maximums. The sun dictates the climates on all the planets in our universe not just earth’s. AOC is not a scientist, and she is listening to frauds lying who are puppets for The United Nations. The Democratic Socialist Party of America is not following the science. No one can control the sun. Man made climate change is a satanic lie. The poles on Mars are melting as we speak. I am sure the Democrats would blame that on us also. There is a globalist agenda that world leaders and the American Democratic Party is embracing. They are lying to us to deprive us of our GOD given rights, liberties, and freedoms. Sustainable Development and AOC’s bastard child “ The Green New Deal “ would make life miserable for everyone. They want to eliminate the suburbs and take away “ The American Dream.” They want to deprive us of being able to own our own homes, camp, fish, hunt, hike, boat, play golf, go to the beach, garden in your backyard, etc. A socialist state abolishes private property ownership. A socialist state abolishes personal wealth. A socialist state abolishes inheritance. A socialist state abolishes personal rights and freedoms and they are using man made climate change to accomplish that.

We can simply look at what has happened recently.\n\nNearly every year in the past decade in the US has been the hottest on record. It's not so much that the hottest days are hotter - it's that we get more of them. This has caused issues with water shortages, decreased crop yields, etc.\n\nBoth the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms have increased. The storms do more damage and we get more of them on average.\n\nThese are fairly easy problems to project into the future. The exact time it will take is uncertain, but temperatures will continue to rise. We will continue to lose farmland and coastal areas will continue to be damaged. The most hyperbolic, fearmongering predictions of disaster are wrong because that sort of thing is always wrong, but there are already visible problems and reason to believe they will get worse.\n\nAs for the \"are we causing it\" question: yes. It's fairly simple to get an estimate of the total carbon dioxide released each year from burning fossil fuels. The history of how much CO2 has been in the atmosphere is also well understood via things like ice core samples going back hundreds of thousands of years. We are releasing CO2 at a speed and quantity that has literally never happened before. The only time we know of that this much was released (by a massive volcano complex) it took thousands of years to release the same amount of CO2 as we have in 150 years.\n\nSo yes, the Earth gets warmer and cooler, but in all the historic data we have it has never gotten this much warmer this fast, and there's no sign of it slowing down.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "extendoduck", "channel": "UCUd9gpaA-8I-nLgARnd9l1Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx6uZm_OND8qRJ0KBP7LiG8UOkMsCflXF_AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The politicians that drive the scare mongering on climate change are those that get the donations from the green energy start-ups, thus they are playing to a special interest group and they're trying to sell \"you'll die if you don't put a trillion dollars towards solar power\".  This seems obvious to me.  Nobody I know has a problem with green energy sources, but you do not achieve the result of cleaner air by simply cutting the supply of petroleum without the supplemental technology to get people back and forth to their jobs, grandma's house, etc.  It's extremely divisive.  There is one way to stop this.  Ban all private sector subsidies to all businesses and CUT THE TAXES on all business even more.  It isn't just that simple, but those are the things that would lead to even green energy technology development.  If it is the markets that dictate the demand on respective energy sources, you cannot get there by using subsidies.  If you have to use subsidies, one of two things is wrong.  1.  You have regulations that oppress the ability of business to be profitable.  2.  The prices of such technology is so high that people are not going to spend money on it.

{"cid": "UgzVrmEYwq3Au7ATXJJ4AaABAg", "text": "The problem I have seen with the debate on whether the climate on earth is warming exponentially caused by humans versus the earth goes through natural cycles and is always changing, is that the vast majority of the scientists who claim that humans cause the climate to warm and if nothing changes all of our coasts will be under water by, insert date here, are funded by the government in one way or another. I didn’t give a specific year because since the late 80s, that specific date continues to change. Once we reach the previous prediction for when our coasts will be under water or the polar caps will be ice free or we won’t be witnessing snowfall anymore, they change said date. This has happened a half dozen times now. The scientists who believe that we go through natural cycles, I’ve found not to be funded by government. Both hypothesis have not been proven, we do not know what is going on with our climate, which they fail to say when making such claims. The government funded studies also claim the sun not playing a major role in our climate. I’m no scientist by any means, but that just seems ludicrous to say given that the sun literally affects everything here on earth. To me, the sun having major affects on our weather AND climate, just seems like logical common sense. But their climate prediction models show little if no interference by the sun. This is a HUGE problem with the hypothesis of human activities being the main driver of our climate. Once the models include the sun being a bigger driver to our climate over human activity, then we will finally see the true state of our climate and what it means going forward. We have a mediocre understanding of our sun and it’s cycles, but we know more about our sun than our climate, that’s for sure.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Kerry Blackburn", "channel": "UCN65Rxgf8IwW9y_M6hmPY2A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ_vVu8S1rJA9V-4usq9tLpEu0HEbtqlcVx=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We all know the effects of droughts and how it can significantly impact agriculture and industry.\n\nAlso, consider the many other problems that climate change can instigate. One of the most obvious being sea-level rise. Not only will this cause economic stress to the infrastructures of urbanized cities on coastlines, but it will also affect the availability and accessibility of freshwater. Salt water intrusion into freshwater aquifers is another issue that you can thank sea-level rise for.\nJust so you understand how this works: the warmer the Earth is, the less ice will form during winters, which means less melt in the summers. Humanity relies on much of that glacial melt to produce freshwater in order to meet yearly demand on agricultural and industrial services that compose much of the economies around the world. \n\nIf climate change doesn’t concern you now, it will once humans starts pricing water at a higher value. When the effects of climate change hinder the access to a vital resource like freshwater, not only will it hurt economies, but the desperation will produce breeding grounds for radical ideologies, terrorism, and violence.\n\nEven if you don’t agree with anything I said, let’s say this issue is true.

Yes, weather changes from year to year because of many cycles including ocean currents and wind patterns, but this is not the same as the orbital cycles that actually change the solar influx that the earth is receiving. What I hear so often is that \"the earth is just coming out of an ice age and warming like it has in the past\" which is actually probably true, the thing that people don't realize is that we shouldn't be seeing the warming trends that we do, because these cycles happen SO VERY slowly. The changes in the earths orbit that lead to ice ages and warmer periods are called Milankovitch Cycles (look them up!) and they occur over tens of THOUSANDS, even hundreds of thousands of years! Though there is much more to be said on this; the fact is that data collected over 100 years is short-term compared to these cycles. Attributing the warming we are seeing now to these cycles shows a lack of understanding of how slowly warming would be occurring if it was truly \"just like it was in the past\".

{"cid": "UgxUy1KZULi8WFlNpvt4AaABAg.9CBqS_I87sk9DzIFYPWwt-", "text": " @Paul Heffner  I appreciate your take on things as you see it today! But there is also EVIDENCE Paul (if I may call you by your first name), the records don't show everything. When I was doing research for a book I was writing, I had to delve deep into ACTUAL church records and many decades ago anything important would be recorded in church records over many many hundreds of years. I wanted to see if there'd been any disasters etc in villages and surrounding villages, in certain places (not all towns and cities) had things like flyers (as we call them today) but church records were used mainly. There, right in front of my eyes in the early 1600's, was a two page account of a massive storm that had taken stone buildings out, torn down stone bridges and uprooted dozens of huge oak trees etc, many people had lost their lives and it gave a list. \nI started to look for information in other places where you would have thought, something as serious as this, would have been recorded and it was NOT, not anywhere to be found. I delved really deep into the parish records at the main record office, still nothing to be found. As I continued with the research that I'd started to look for, there again, I was confronted with a full account of there being an extremely hot summer 2 yrs later after the storm! Again, many young and old had lost their lives because of it... Much as we are warned today of what can happen in extreme hot weather! To only find the information in a church Baptism book and no info about these two incidents (not even in the records in London where all documents/information has been copied and archived), proves that not all information was recorded in the so called accounts that places like the Met office would have on their records or those they use for past events, I know I've checked them out for the info I needed as mentioned above! \n\nThen, my own grandmother who was 100 when I was asked her questions on the subject (she passed aged 104 in 2004 still sharp as a whistle) I'd asked her if she'd known anything about it as it had taken place in the area where she'd been born and lived all her life and she said she knew nothing about it, but she then went on to say that, as far back as she could remember and she could remember back to being 5, the weather changed like this all the time... She remembered extreme hot summers and knee/thigh deep snowy winters and then mild YEARS with neither weather as just mentioned... So our yearly cycles are within a cycle and yes, we've had hot tropical weather for years, the cliff strata tells you this... and we've also had mini ice ages for many years, as you mentioned in the  Milankovitch Cycles, and we'll continue to have these cycles for many millennia to come. \nIt maddens me when reporters report on HOW BAD THE WEATHER IS GETTING along the coastal areas, as they show buildings dropping over the cliffs... What they don't say, is nothing about folk BUILDING TOO NEAR THEM, KNOWING THAT THE CLIFFS ARE PRONE TO COLLAPSING, whether that be slow or not, these builders must do their research and see that over the past 30yrs the land has fallen into the sea by at least 3 miles when they started to record it, but they make the story so dramatic and call it Climate change, it is not, most cliff faces like the one at Scarborough are built on soft soils, (The cliff consists of Glacial Till (sandy, silty clay) resting on a low cliff of the Middle Jurassic Scalby Formation. The Scalby Formation comprises Scalby Mudstone and Moor Grit (sandstone). So anyone with an ounce of sense knows that water hitting soft sediments  will eventually WEAR IT AWAY, that does not mean that it's anything to do with the climate. The UK is surrounded by water and 30 years ago, there had been 3 miles more of land at Scarborough than there is today, it has simply been washed away because of its strata, soft soil... It will continue to wash away until the water hits solid rock, which will still wear away, but at a much slower pace! \n\nMost people today, well those under the age of 35, see more than an inch of snow and the country stops, while us oldies sit back in shock because we've seen it like it before. It beggars belief that we can get strong winds and according to the young ones the world is going to end, we get a storm and the world is going to end, we get a hot summer and the world is going to end! No it's not, it will go on as it always has done! Some times you have to STOP taking in what you see on the TV screen as they've been caught out lying. Making things seem far worse than they actually are... \nTake CNN,  They recorded a storm last year, they put it out about how bad the storm was, but what the idiot reporter didn't see was when they televised the clip, there right at the top of the screen in the background were a couple walking normal away from the camera! What they'd done to make it look like the reporter was about to blown over, was to have a blow machine at the side out of view and turned on high, making it look like the reporter could hardly stand up! It was so fake but the report had many folk frightened in the beginning until they saw what they'd done to BRAINWASH the public. We know for a fact that some things we see on TV are not what they look like and some things are done on purpose to FRIGHTEN THE PUBLIC!", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Jennings644", "channel": "UCdTaNwr7M_0xgpJyd3Kw-5A", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRJsx3NTIxIm1mbEH-UvQ5qvL80TL1at_gDb4bH=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The problem is since Al Gore the RISK and repercussions of climate disaster to our global societies has been taken over by politicians and used as a platform.  This one factor, although drawing public attention to what 90% of scientists now agree, is the reason for inaction.  Politicians want to govern society for economic financial reasons, and that is the bottom line.  There is only one way forward if you have enough intelligence and survival resilience, is to research for yourself the reality and impacts of climate change—whether human caused or not—you don't have to watch it on TV in documentaries that you think are propaganda.  You might live in California and have suffered wild fires, or Australia for that matter.  Or you might live on an island in the pacific or Miami, that is rapidly drowning.  Governments ARE acting for the climate changes - because it is the biggest impact to our economic wealth that we as a species are facing.  But do we as individuals survive by waiting for governments to tell us it is real or not - whether left, right or out the door?  How adaptive and resilient is that?  If we individually believe that this is a greater threat to our livelihoods, jobs and children than who we vote for to tell us how to effectively run our countries- we must take action for ourselves—at grass roots—find the truth and take community actions.  When Gandhi led 200 million people to freedom, the Bengal famine wasn't \"real\" either.  That was because Winston Churchill and the first world empire were fighting a war against Germany and Japan and wanted India's men and food resources for their own cause.  Thirty million people died in that famine - mostly invisibly because it was a third world country.  Individually you can't sign the Paris agreement or order corporations to stop carbon emissions.  But there are other actions you can take towards greening your community and adaptive resilience in the face of what we do know is a fact:  the Earth climate is rapidly changing and humans are facing massive environmental threats wherever they live.

We can differentiate these subjects, by sale offers, representing  consistencies in climate, thus no or very little change is made annually. Yet, associate normal/regular prices to be inadequecies within climate change. \n\nWe all shop for the cheapest thing, however, we have to resort to buying products at normal prices. Sometimes these products may be on offer. However, we are never to know when products will have an offer on them. The one thing that stays consistent, is that we purchase the product, thus our shopping total fluctuates. Subsequently, if none of the products are on sale though, then the original value will increase the overall expenditure. Thus climate change can be thought of on these principles.

{"cid": "UgzGYEB9dg6BaA3hjkd4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Then all those thousands of jobs across the US at auto parts stores lost because no parts are being produced because of the crazy idea of banning cars, and the closing of auto parts stores because thier jobs were taken away. Just because someone like AOC suggests banning of cars or whatever she might suggest, it is not as clear cut as she might make it out to be.

I think people just have to consider the possibility that it eventually will change regardless and enter into a new paradigm on earth. However we are far more equipped to handle it then life would have been before. The arrogance of man is to think we somehow can control nature and that just is not the case. Why I think people really freak out over it is because they may finally have to be really confronted with their belief of the afterlife. I don't think most people can even consider the possibility that humans will just be another footnote in the history of the world and that we really might not be the end all plan of God and that we are not really that special. Just another biological mutation of genetics that will one day run it's course and be replaced by whatever is left to survive the conditions of earth going forward. Why should natural selection and evolution just stop at homosapian ? Do I look forward to a future in which the earth may possibly no longer be able to sustain the species as we are now, of course not I feel bad for future generations that may be the last on earth but at the end of the day there is always that possibility it will happen no matter what we try and do about it, taking into account the history of the planet. Who knows perhaps there is even a chance that future generations over time will adapt and in enough time could lead the way to evolving the human species into something more suitable for the changed environment. As we all know homosapian definitely was not the first humanoid species to live.

Not only does co2 cause climate change, it does in a direct and linear relationship. So lets crunch the numbers. In the last 300 years global temperature has risen 1 degree Celsius, while co2 levels rose from 295 to 383 parts per million. That means that 88 parts per million gives a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. So to find out what temperature we would get with a pure co2 atmosphere we can divide 1 million by 90 (rounding up 88 for convenience) to get 11,111. If your bullshit detector hasn't gone off you are a socialist idiot. If you think an increase of over 11,100 degree Celsius is a bad result you are not seeing the trees for the forest. I would file a patent for a \"Carbon dioxide charged solar energy collector.\" and become the richest being on the planet. It will not work because co2 does not cause climate change.

{"cid": "UgwqC_3Jdrbb2mWe-YZ4AaABAg", "text": "My dad was a geologist who worked building the great dams of the North West. He moved us away from the volcanoes and was not surprised when Mount Saint Helens blew even though supposedly everybody else was. He told us kids not to be worried about climate change that the world was warming up as it was supposed to and had been for the last 100 years that recycling was a good thing because he grew up doing it during the depression and that you shouldn't waste anything but he told us that the government and people will try to have you look one way & not be afraid of what's really happening. He told us the world is going to get warmer. It's not going to be like it was for the last 500 years where, unfortunately, we built all of our cities next to the ocean, just like the people before us 10000 years ago, and then they got flooded when, poof! ocean rose 400 feet. \n\nHe showed us how the Earth cycles & sadly modern man in his hubris thinks his science will control all things. But when you speak with the Native Americans, listen to their history, those that knew the history of their area, you got a different story. That a great cold had come over the land 600 years before and had frozen the sleeping giants (volcanoes), changed their world.  Now it was lessening its hold, and things are becoming warm again, where it hadn't been warm for many turns of the sun. \nLike my father said, it's easier to make people look at something they think they can control instead of trying to teach them about something there's nothing they can do about. \n\n In Puyallup, WA they now have volcano evacuation drills. We never had them when I was a kid, but they're very serious about it. Some of the hot springs are closed in Mammoth, CA, they lost 3 Ski Patrol members when they were trying to put temporary fencing around an open vent &  died from toxic fumes. \n \nThere was an earthquake in Big Bear Lake CA when there had never been knowledge of any fault line running near it. Previously there'd been geological testing looking for one. The one place everybody thought they'd be ok, no one had any earthquake insurance. The storms are getting worse in the Atlantic, coming onto land, causing greater devastation. Tornados are touching down stronger, larger & in strange places. The world is going back to the weather pattern it had before the freeze. Modern man doesn't know what that is.\n\nSwitzerland will know, because they have a record of it, maybe some of the other countries, if they're able to dig up any of their old records. Maybe their history will tell them. The Americas that is going to be a big question. \n\nAfrica will be changed too because they will no longer have the dirty smoke from the British Isles to help them  obtain rain. Like my dad said,  clean air doesn't help keep the earth cool, so we can obtain rain.  \n\nMaybe the volcanoes waking up again will help us out, but we really didn't want that because their product is more toxic & causes problems with our machines. The world is going to be an interesting place, it will be more like it was before Christopher Columbus set out to find the New World. \n\nWhen one thinks about the fact the people settling at Roanoke came to the New World in one of the worst times of drought.

{"cid": "Ugw6-713sO132Q53Q7J4AaABAg.8xI-8CwNhLe8xJjBmEDvmu", "text": "Hi Brian Schaefer, I do not have the answer to all your questions but debating with people is something that I enjoy. First of all, I am not really into politics so I  will not attack or support any party, I am just a young scientist that wants to share something that he learned. \r\n\r\n1) Humans do contribute to climate change. \r\nWe humans directly participate in air pollution and air pollution has a lot to do with global warming. Let's use a quantum mechanics perspective. We would not talk about sunlight but energy and radiation. The Earth´s atmosphere has natural CO2 levels which help to keep the planet warm. The sunlight is made of photons (radiation) which after hitting the Earth´s surface go back to space and there is when CO2 acts. Now we will consider the molecular level. The photons hit the CO2 molecules which excite the electrons in the CO2 and therefore they have a higher energy level. In nature, molecules do not like to be in a high energy level, they prefer to be stable or in a low energy level, so the excited electron goes back to its original energy level sending a new photon to the Earth (energy/radiation). This is more or less how CO2 helps to keep the planet warm (I'm not a physicist, but I took college-level courses and like to know about cool stuff). Now, If we have more CO2 levels in the air (directly related to air pollution), more CO2 molecules would keep more photons (radiation) in the atmosphere and radiation is responsible for keeping the Earth warm. Now, there are records that suggest that since the industrial revolution, CO2 levels in the air have arisen due to human activities. What is really interesting is that sunlight is not the only radiations that contribute to this process. The Earth itself emits radiation from its nucleus causing CO2 to emit photons that would also contribute to Earth´s temperature. So yeah, both are connected, air pollutions can lead to global warming.\r\n\r\n2) I guess that the answer would depend on who you ask, let me explain myself. I remember that I saw a video on youtube from an organization that makes videos about politics and they were discussing whether or not climate change was as bad as people suggest. They did not deny climate change but suggested that it wasn´t that bad because there were just a few deads related to events caused by climate change. They might be right, perhaps people are not dying because of climate but in my personal opinion, they failed to address the problems that animals and nature are facing because of climate change. The is no doubt that the Antartic ice is melting because of the increasing temperatures which have had a negative impact on the animals inhabiting that area. At the same time, other natural ecosystems have been affected by climate change resulting in animals struggling with these harsh conditions and of course, dying. So in my opinion, even though humans might no be directly dying because of climate change, it has a negative impact on animals and nature. and for me, it is something to worry about. \r\n\r\nThis is all that I have, I don´t have answers for the last two questions, I am just a Neuroscientist. It is your decision what to think about this topic, I personally believe that it is something very important to consider, so let me know what you think.

We would not talk about sunlight but energy and radiation. The Earth´s atmosphere has natural CO2 levels which help to keep the planet warm. The sunlight is made of photons (radiation) which after hitting the Earth´s surface go back to space and there is when CO2 acts. Now we will consider the molecular level. The photons hit the CO2 molecules which excite the electrons in the CO2 and therefore they have a higher energy level. In nature, molecules do not like to be in a high energy level, they prefer to be stable or in a low energy level, so the excited electron goes back to its original energy level sending a new photon to the Earth (energy/radiation). This is more or less how CO2 helps to keep the plant warm (I'm not a physicist, but I took college-level courses and like to know about cool stuff). Now, If we have more CO2 levels in the air (directly related to air pollution), more CO2 molecules would keep more photons (radiation) in the atmosphere and radiation is responsible for keeping the Earth warm. Now, there are records that suggest that since the industrial revolution, CO2 levels in the air have arisen due to human activities. What is really interesting is that sunlight is not the only radiations that contribute to this process. The Earth itself emits radiation from its nucleus causing CO2 to emit photons that would also contribute to Earth´s temperature. So yeah, both are connected, air pollutions can lead to global warming.

Countless volcanoes, asteroids, plate tectonics, solar activity,  moon activity, space shit, etc.  Sure they may have some sort of idea but its not definite.\n\n\nAs far as I'm aware the record only goes back to the mid to late 1850s.

Hell, some records only go back to 1970s if I'm not mistaken (i don't remember which). \n\n\nOn top of that, the solutions I hear proposed is basically give the government more power/control.

For example, you said \"Science can’t say anything, that’s a scientific fact-\"  Right?  Do you have a dictionary?  Or use the Internet in any productive fashion?  I don't think that you do. If you ever bothered to read rather than spout nonsense you would actually know something.  But it's plain that you don't.  Here is a quote for you.  \"Fact: In science, an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as “true.” Truth in science, however, is never final and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow.\"  Ok?  So a fact is an observation that has been repeated again and again so that's what a fact is!!!  It's science saying something!! Or put another way?  It's the scientific community saying something.  So you're really quite wrong.  Not only does science say something?  That is what a scientific fact is, by definition!  As for calling you a dipsh!t?  Yeah, based on your comments?  It can be observed to be true!  If you made intelligent remarks?  I'd have to agree and not call you a dipsh!t.  So yeah, I haven't observed any intelligence yet.  As for your other comments?  It's all just blather and nonsense. I mean you mention Darwin right?  But you don't even bother to read and more importantly understand what a fact is!!!!   By the way? I don't have every definition memorized.  But I do pay attention to the \"facts\".  You should do the same.  At least you should do the same on occasion.  And actually maybe dipsh!t is a bit strong.

But how can you disagree with his position.  Climate and environmental alarmist have been making predictions for decade that have never come to fruition.\n\n\nIn the 60's and 70's they were predicting that human activity was going to cause an ice age.  When the climate failed to cooperate they change their rhetoric to claiming that human activity was causing global warming.  Recently, the more intelligent and sophisticated of the human caused proponents changed their rhetoric to to claiming that human activity was causing climate change; an intelligent choice since \"climate change' covers anything the climate does and allows them to avoid the embarrassment of the climate not doing what they predicted.\n\n\nexample:\nHow many \"experts\" have made how many authoritative predictions over the past 20 years that human caused global warming was going to cause the arctic to be ice free by now.\nHow many of those experts tried to explain this past winter how human caused global warming caused the suppose-to-be ice free arctic to generate record cold temperatures and snow falls.\n\n\nIs the arctic ice free?  Is the arctic anywhere near being ice free?\n\n\nThe human caused proponents start their measurements of human caused global warming in the 1800's.  Can you guess why?  If you look at paleoclimate graphs of the past couple thousand years you will see that the Earth was starting to warm up from the Medieval Cool Period.  That way they do not have to deal with the Medieval Warm Period which many scientist say was just as warm as it is now and happened when the human population was measured in millions and no one knew what fossil fuel were much less used them to power society's energy needs and wants.\n\n\nMakes it easy to make dramatic claims as long as people are ignorant of history and science.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Old Time Farm Boy", "channel": "UCQLlpwcp-ax40rN1AQwg9XA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ20mAaik9ZAtgOUnVLskFrzxlFup5Pol5Y-D2d=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is also a TAR planet that's what plants do they TAR! we need to bring these people to Los Angeles to see the La Brea Tar Pits so they can understand oil is everywhere including Texas gasoline collected on top of the ground and the property owners sold it during the Depression to the Model T guys driving by. They called it pit gas. I will take you to the 14 freeway where crude oil is oozing out of the side of the mountain into buckets that they have to change everyday on the gas company property. This planet is oozing gas and oil like you can't believe. Rush Limbaugh's explained some scientific data that the Earth leaks as much oil on the bottom of all the oceans as we actually pull out with Machinery every single day. therefore the Earth has mechanisms to clean itself and we are not damaging it like these silly people think we are because they do not know the whole story they only know their little segment of their little class there in. climate change is a moot point since we are still in the tail end of an ice age and we are not close to the planets mean temperature.

Scientists can say how old something that used to be alive is with carbon dating. If they find fossils from big tropical trees in the Arctic they carbon date them and find out how many years ago there were tropical trees in the Arctic, which means that the climate in the artic was tropical x years ago. If they find remains of hairy mammals in Africa they carbon date them and come to the conclusion that it was cold in africa ω years ago. They also study the ground. Thats literally what the entire field of the science of geology does. Scientists know that every 1000 years the ground rises by a few centimetres. So they dig the earth grab a piece and study it's layers. Based on the layers and on how deep they dug to grab that piece they say that on that region x years ago there was an ocean or there was a lot of volcanic activity etc.\nThat's how scientists know that 56 million year ago the earth was warmer than it is now, there were tropical trees all the way to the north pole and there was barely any life in the oceans at that period.

Let's use a quantum mechanics perspective. We would not talk about sunlight but energy and radiation. The Earth´s atmosphere has natural CO2 levels which help to keep the planet warm. The sunlight is made of photons (radiation) which after hitting the Earth´s surface go back to space and there is when CO2 acts. Now we will consider the molecular level. The photons hit the CO2 molecules which excite the electrons in the CO2 and therefore they have a higher energy level. In nature, molecules do not like to be in a high energy level, they prefer to be stable or in a low energy level, so the excited electron goes back to its original energy level sending a new photon to the Earth (energy/radiation). This is more or less how CO2 helps to keep the planet warm (I'm not a physicist, but I took college-level courses and like to know about cool stuff). Now, If we have more CO2 levels in the air (directly related to air pollution), more CO2 molecules would keep more photons (radiation) in the atmosphere and radiation is responsible for keeping the Earth warm. Now, there are records from the American Chemical Society that suggest that since the industrial revolution, CO2 levels in the air have arisen due to human activities. What is really interesting is that sunlight is not the only radiation that contributes to this process. The Earth itself emits radiation from its nucleus causing CO2 to emit photons that would also contribute to Earth´s temperature.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Luis Aguilera Luna", "channel": "UCl_dEErakBqskbYztFb0j0g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQwLKakTA5kx2J5y1pBDD2ip2Vmyu530M5p8x7jWg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However, when a specific bacteria that used sunlight as a source of energy starts to fill out the air with oxygen, many species started to die, because oxygen was poison for them. This is known as one of the 5 greatest extinction in the Earth´s history, around 90% of the species vanished.

It is true that the Earth´s temperature hasn´t increased that much (around 1 Celcius degree) during that time but at the same time, the temperature hasn´t gone back to its original level as before the industrial revolution.  There are fluctuations, as in every experiment, but still, the graphs show an increasing behavior. I am not telling you that we would have catastrophic consequences in a few years, I am not qualified to make that assumption, but you cannot deny the correlated increasing behavior, even though it could have a small contribution.

I don't know if you might be interested, but while I was watching a documentary (Cosmos, not really about the environment but they discuss a little bit) they mentioned that from the different Greenhouse gases, Methane has a greater impact on Earth's temperature than CO2, but of course, we have directly changed the CO2 concentration, not the Methane concentration. This made me wonder if every gas has a different contribution to Earth's temperature, that could explain why the Earth's temperature hasn't increased that much in contrast to CO2 concentration. Let us try to use a simple equation just to explain this, imagine that the Earth's temperature is represented by T= 0.5H20 + 2.4CH4 + 1.5N2O + 1.3CO2 + 1.0 O3 (not a real equation) where H2O is water, CH4 is methane, N2O is nitrous oxide, CO2 is carbon dioxide and O3 ozone. As we can see, each gas has a different contribution and the combination of all of them states the Earth's temperature and because CO2 is not the one with the highest contribution, it would take higher CO2 levels to drastically change the Earth's temperature, which could explain why the Earth's temperature hasn't changed that much in contrast with the CO2 levels, because CO2 is not the only variable in the equation, and because is not the one with the highest contribution. However, the amount of CO2 levels continues to increase, which could, in the future, increase the Earth's temperature. This is a hypothetical case, I don't really know the equation that explains the temperature behavior, but I found if very interesting. As for the Earth's temperature, I found that the average Earth' temperature is about 15 Celcius degrees, with the industrial revolution, if the Earth's temperature increased about 1 Celcius degree since the industrial revolution, that means that the Earth's temperature increased around 7% of its original temperature during the same period, it would be interesting to know how much did it change before the industrial revolution in a similar time period.

The Earth's temperature has always changed regardless of human activity. Scientists have made mispredictions and have failed to address certain concerns. And changing the world's economy will, of course, have a huge impact. However, if scientists do not speak out about this topic, who else can? maybe it is because I am a scientist myself (Neuroscience graduate student), but taking in consideration the experts' opinions is the smartest thing that you can do and not just what politicians have to say. yeah, you always have to question everything when talking about such delicate topic like changing the world's economy, but also they have succeeded in predicting certain things. For example, during the first part of the last century, a US scientist stated that just a small change in the Earth's temperature (a few degrees) would be enough to melt the Antartic ice, which it is actually happening. At the same time, according to Neil Degrasse Tyson, the Earth's temperature increased more or less as scientists predicted. Finally, I guess that neither of us can change each other opinion about the impact of CO2 levels, but I do believe it has something to do with climate change, as many scientists (people that actually study this) do. If it has been proved that Greenhouse gases play a critical role in Earth's temperature (for good or bad), and there is no doubt that human activity influents the amount of at least one of those gases, for sure humans contribute to climate change in a certain way.
