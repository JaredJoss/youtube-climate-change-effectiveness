To say such absurd things they must be relying on the lack of education and or sheer stupidity of the average Australian. In a nut shell, there is a slow and obvious increase in global temperature, the real issue is the increasing rate at which we are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, the sea can only absorb so much of it, and, as temperature increases the amount it can hold decreases, seas become acidic, destroying ecosystems, potentially damaging oxygen producing plankton on the sea surfaces, it is the unknown effects in the future that are worrying, because we are NOT reducing our CO2 output, it is in fact increasing, there is no point in denying it now so we can later say we didn't know that we fucked our planet, the data points in one direction, look at the slope on the graph, looking at local cooling and saying oh there's no problem is just nuts.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "psycronizer", "channel": "UC2DmeWiTSsoD9bLjIdSnNUg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSU3Uun8hBZZJrYTT2dcZceuKN025IAz6u7ag=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxSUgTHYwNebPz3foR4AaABAg.9OXmEL5fFIr9REG66Srh-9", "text": " @Anthony Morris  Part of what I study as a researcher is how people misjudge  what is true or effective in various fields, and one fascinating reason we get fooled is by choosing the wrong data. A second key reason is we don't interpret well the data we have--and we often misinterpret data because we lack other data that could have helped us see the bigger picture. \n\nFor example, if you choose US wildfire data for the last 100 years, you immediately see the wildfires used to burn FAR more acres in the late 1920s through 1940s than they do now. Using that data, many people note that US wildfires are down dramatically over the past, so they  concluded that there's no reason for us to worry that man-made global warming will or has increased wildfires. \n\nThere are a few problems with that line of reasoning, and they are big problems. First, the sky-high heat waves, droughts, and wildfires in the US in the late 1920s-1940s were not \"normal conditions\" for the US, they were of the by-product of dumb farming methods that created perhaps the worst man-made ecological disaster of the past--the Dust Bowl. Hundreds of millions of acres of land were tilled, leaving bare ground that lost its ability to retain moisture, resist drought, and support life. Ground that is bare can get up to 20-25 degrees F hotter in the summer than would ground that is covered with lush vegetation, so the hotter and drier conditions created local climate change in the west that was perfect for massive forest fires. Second, as more people started living in remote areas of the west, government got more serious about trying to put out forest fires. Third, as firefighting methods improved, even when fires broke out, we contained them faster and they burned fewer acres than they would have back in the 1930s. Thus, comparing wildfire acreage burned in the U.S. in the 1930s to the 2010s or 2020s is like comparing apples to watermelons--comparing acreage burned during a massive ecological disaster which made fires worse AND when we cared less about fighting fires and had less capacity to fight them to a later age when all those  conditions have changed. \n\nThus, knowing that, and knowing most global warming occurred in recent decades, lets ask a more sensible question of the data. What are the trends in acreage burned after we cared more about fighting fires and had better technology to fight them (and weren't in the middle of the Dust Bowl)? Asking that question, acreage burned was pretty constant on average from the mid 1950s to the mid 1990s, but then it starts ramping up dramatically when the effects of global warming start kicking in. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, there was some \"greening effect\" from CO2 fertilization, but for the last 20 years, the hotter and drier conditions caused by higher CO2 levels has caused an increasing trend of global browning. Hotter and drier vegetation burns more easily, so wildfires are ramping up (also hotter drier conditions spawn more lightning strikes and make even pretty normal human activity more likely to trigger wildfires). \n\n\"Yet the temp graph doesn't even come close to these graphs. We've used more fossil fuels in the last 20 years than in the entire period prior. From 1900 until 2016 (the peak) temps have risen barely 1.5 degrees. From 1930 until 2020 it is almost completely flat.\" Hmm, not sure what data you are looking at, but over the last 400,000 years, global temps and CO2 levels have tracked each other very closely. \n\nhttps://duckduckgo.com/?q=chart+of+CO2+and+temperatures&atb=v131-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnenglander.net%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F07%2FCO2-Temperature%2520420%2520kyr.gif\n\nAll other things (orbital cycles, solar activity)  being equal, CO2 levels are the main control knob influencing global temps--albeit in part by increasing water vapor. \n\nFrom 1880 to now, CO2 levels and global temps have also tracked closely:\n\nhttps://duckduckgo.com/?q=chart+of+CO2+and+temperatures&atb=v131-1&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http%3A%2F%2Fassets.climatecentral.org%2Fimages%2Fuploads%2Fgallery%2F2017EarthDay_TempAndCO2_en_title_lg.jpg\n\nAlso see https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2912/satellite-data-record-shows-climate-changes-impact-on-fires/\n\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/blog/3066/the-climate-connections-of-a-record-fire-year-in-the-us-west/\n\nTake care.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However I did have some issues with the graphs you sent but it would be easier to show you rather than try to describe here. Which is impossible. So I will have to leave that. \n\nI'm also not disputing climate change. My argument basically states that this is not apocalyptic.

{"cid": "UgxSUgTHYwNebPz3foR4AaABAg.9OXmEL5fFIr9RHoPQdVjJS", "text": "​ @Anthony Morris  Thanks for your reply. \nI'll do this in pieces, so as to be more manageable for both of us. \n\n\"There are also around 7.5 times the amount of people today so natural disasters are seemingly more frightening.\" OK, we agree on that, and of course they get more widely reported as well. But the fact a disaster affects more people now means it now takes a bigger chunk of personal and national budgets to prevent and repair the effects of such disasters.\n\n\"My burn acreage statement was to illustrate how effective we've become at dealing with fires.\" Sure, but the problem is that despite ever-improving fire-fighting methods, the acres burned are rising again--and are doing so when we have more at stake in those areas not burning. Larger fires also represent a reinforcing feedback loop for man-made global warming, releasing massive amounts of CO2. \n\nAnother difference between disasters now and those in the 20th century is that prior to ~1970, the Earth could heal itself faster than we were withdrawing resources and damaging it. Since 1970, the rate of damage has increasingly outpaced the rate of regeneration and healing, and our current footprint is now ~175% of the annual carrying capacity of the Earth. So, just as someone who has declining health and reduced resilience is knocked more for a loop by an illness, when there is a bad drought or destructive hurricane, that is a bigger blow now, one that is pushing ecosystems closer to collapse. For example, due to hotter and drier conditions caused by our GG emissions, in some places after a forest fire these days (e.g., parts of the Sierra Nevada range) , the forest hasn't been regrowing as a forest, but as scrubland. This represents  ratcheting closer to collapse because scrubland sequesters less CO2 and water, and supports less biodiversity.  \n\n\"Hurricanes, droughts and floods are not getting worse.\" Floods are a mixed bag because air that is 1º C warmer can hold around 7% more moisture, so many places on Earth are getting drier but when the skies do open, they have and will often drop record-breaking precipitation--and the warmer it gets, the stronger both effects will become. So the total number of floods may not increase but some of the flooding will be almost \"biblical.\" \n\nAs for droughts, it is clear they are starting to get worse and IPCC correctly and confidently predicts increased drought overall (with the caveat that due to climate disruption and changing location of the jetstream, some places that have been historically dry will get more rain). More water up in the air means less down hear where we need it, those are just the laws of physics. You can see this gradual trend in the last 20 years, as the degree of water deficit to surplus across a decade has tipped significantly to the deficit side in places like Australia and the American West. \n\nhttps://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/drought-in-the-western-united-states-sets-a-122-year-record   \n\nUnlike past drought cycles--which resolve themselves when the natural cycles/orbits tip the other way--these droughts will keep getting worse on average as more and more warming puts more and more moisture up in the sky. Thus, unless we fix it--and rapidly--it is a one-way ratchet effect, unlike anything modern civilization has lived through. \n\nHurricanes: Cat 4 and 5 hurricanes have become markedly more common in the last 20 years, even compared to earlier decades when we had good satellite data. If you don't believe me, look up all the CAT 4 and CAT 5 hurricanes by decade, and count them as I have. Hotter oceans put more energy into hurricanes. There are three other documented changes in hurricanes: 1) They are intensifying faster, 2) They are stalling in one place longer (e.g., over the poor Bahamas), and 3) They are breaking down more slowly after landfall--this causing more intense damage inland. Again. more heat energy in the system allows for more powerful storms and helps them stay strong.  \n \n\"Prematurely introducing energy that is expensive and unreliable could have a greater dire effect on human flourishing than the consequences of climate change.\" \nEven without accounting for the trillions of dollars of externalized costs shifted to future generations by burning fossil fuels,  renewables are already as cheap or cheaper than FFs in many places, and as we ramp them up--and perhaps shift subsidies from deadly fossil fuels to less destructive renewables, the price advantage for renewables will just keep getting larger. So-called \"green energy\" also employs far more people in places like the US than FFs do. \n\nEven the hedge funds and big banks have pointed out we are well past they point where it would be cheaper in the long run to rapidly transition. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention costs less than a pound of cure. \n\nSpeaking of the costs of dealing with the problems humans have set in motion, Houston is eyeing a $26 billion system to protect themselves from storm surges. It will take $100 million a year to maintain, there's no guarantee it would work, and the way hydrology works, if you hold back the surge in one place, it just makes the flooding worse next door. \n\nAs for the Dutch, when they raise their dikes 1 m, they have to make them 10 m wider to maintain the same structural integrity. Evidence from Earth's past indicates that if we leave the Earth at 400-450 ppm CO2, we can expect 30+ feet of eventual sea level rise. So the Dutch would have to make those dikes at least a football field wider across their entire length than they are now--and the costs for each additional meter increase in height keep rising, taking more and more out of national budgets. This same dynamic applies to heat waves, droughts, crop failures, etc. \n\nWhether it's human health, a car repair, or ecosystems, it's cheaper to fix the underlying cause as soon as possible rather than to pay to treat symptoms for years or decades, and THEN fix the underlying causes after the root cause of the problem has grown much larger in size.  \n\nMore later.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgxSUgTHYwNebPz3foR4AaABAg.9OXmEL5fFIr9RJxWu_Kz6o", "text": " @Anthony Morris  A few more thoughts on your comments:\n\n\"One of the most proven methods to keep us safe from every single threat imaginable is wealth and prosperity. This is also under attack.\" Yes in one way and no in two ways. \n\nFirst no. When we in wealthy countries (I'm American) have created more wealth/grown the economy, being richer did put us wealthy folks in the position where we could afford to buy the things that protected us in the short-term from various threats (hunger, heat waves, etc.). \n\nHowever, wealth for wealthy nations has always been created through a process of legalized theft in which the billions of people in poorer nations are underpaid for their labor and natural resources. The \"haves\" had many mechanisms for carrying out this legalized theft, including land enclosures, slavery, gunboat diplomacy, hijacking other countries governments and installing folks favorable to pro-America and pro-capitalist policies, and tricking other countries into debt bondage (See Killing Hope and Confessions of an Economic Hit Man for a summary of some of this--and notice how the US is meddling in Venezuela and Bolivia and spreading propaganda about both... because we want Venezuela's oil and Bolivia's lithium). In the process, people in nations in the \"global south\" became less secure, their governments became increasingly dysfunctional, and their ecosystems were plundered. Thus, wealth creation made some people more secure by making others less secure.  \n\nSecond no. Creating cash wealth almost always involves more destruction of Earth's ecosystems via ecosystems disruption/destruction, pollution, killing species directly, and increased global warming. Put differently, growing the private sector economy larger has always involved shrinking the Earth economy that is the basis for all life on Earth, for our civilization--and for the private sector economy. Given that all these forces are already pushing ecosystems down the path towards collapse, you are buying a temporary boost in security by making worse the problem you are trying to protect yourself from. Continuing economic growth is incompatible with keeping ecosystems intact and able to support us because that money almost always involves further destruction of the web of life. Thus, trying to solve our ecological threats by growing the economy is like paying off your credit card debt using a credit card with a higher interest rate. For a different analogy, given that the private sector economy has a parasitic relationship with the Earth economy, growing the private sector economy larger and larger and larger is like the cancer getting bigger and bigger and eventually killing off the host organism on which it depends. Thus, we simply have to transcend that way of thinking whereby we think continued growth is possible or a good thing.\n\n\"The Netherlands has the ability to keep the Dutch safe. Bangladesh, not so much.\"\nGiven that the ecological problems facing the poorer countries were primarily caused by richer countries, we richer countries have a moral obligation to help fix the ecological problems we created and protect poorer countries from the monsters we are unleashing. From  scientific and self-preservation perspectives, there is simply no way to avoid ecological collapse unless wealth is more broadly spread across the world.  That is, the challenges we face are so massive and urgent, we can no longer afford to have people or governments anywhere who are so poor they can't afford the greener approaches and are tempted by the dirtier ones (coal-fired power plants). \n\n \"I see fossil fuels like I see vaccines. A cost benefit analysis demonstrates that the positives far out way the negatives.\" From a long-term perspective, the benefits of phasing out fossil fuels outweigh the costs by a factor of a thousand to one, or perhaps a million to one (or even an infinite ratio), especially given that continuing to burn fossil fuels risks runaway global warming and mass extinctions of life. If you haven't studied the science and listen to unqualified folks like Bjorn Lomborg, you might be under the impression that a world 3-4 degrees C warmer would be just fine, but in fact much of the world would be unlivable at the point, and we would then have a very hard time avoiding 5-6 degrees of warming, and extinctions on a mass scale. \nLet's remember that the last 5 times CO2 levels on earth spiked, mass extinctions occurred. Just sayin'.\n\nTake care.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What a tragic and exasperating way to end this conversation. While I disagreed with many of your views and assertions on climate change, I at least respected your approach and analysis.\" Implode? I offered a calm and careful analysis of our situation, including its causes, and its solutions. If I am understanding correctly, you have now responded so strongly because you disagree with my analysis, are unaccustomed to hearing these facts--and are personally bothered by them--and thus have lost interest in discussing the points. \n\nIt is well-established empirically that expanding the economy causes more ecological destruction. It is also well-established empirically that the richest people and richest nations have caused and still cause the majority of ecological destruction. Those facts are not in dispute. Even greater energy efficiency just leads to more total consumption of energy, a phenomenon know as Jevons' Paradox. Thus, when we as consumers have the experience that more economic growth, more economic development or more personal wealth solves some of our short-term personal problems, the creation of that wealth/growth/ development simultaneously caused more    ecological destruction. \n\n\"Most importantly, at this time I'll remind myself how fortunate I am to live in a Western society that embraces democratic principles like free and fair elections, freedom, liberty, a free press, free speech, human rights, property rights, secular government, rule of law, a separate judiciary ...\" All of that refers to a representative democracy/constitutional republic, and has nothing to do with capitalism in general nor the the form of winner-take-all capitalism that has hijacked our democracy over the last 40 years.  It is also well-established that when too much wealth gets concentrated in too few hands, that corrodes and then destroys democracy. \n\n“Corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in few hands and the republic is destroyed.”   \r\n- Abraham Lincoln\r\n\nOr, as former U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis put it: \r\n\r\n “You can have wealth concentrated in a few hands, or you can have democracy, but you can’t have both.”\r\n\nHistory shows that highly concentrated wealth causes governments to become corrupted and collapse (see Jared Diamond's work) but economic history demonstrates that unless checked by powerful counterbalancing forces, capitalism concentrates more and more wealth in fewer and fewer hands (see Piketty's research--or just the last 20 years in the US). That growing inequality spells the death of both democracy and also turns out to be deadly for ecosystems. It also demoralizes the 99% and leads to exactly the kind of fraying of the social fabric we are seeing in America today. To have a healthy society, wealth HAS TO be distributed much more equally than in the U.S. (See the research in The Spirit Level). \n\n\"The roadmap to wealth and prosperity that so many other cultures willfully reject, attack and bear the resulting suffering.\" \n\nI'm not sure quite who you have in mind, but I'm just spelling out the laws of nature:   Growth in the private sector economy has always been created by exploiting and degrading the Earth economy--the latter being the foundational economy for all life on Earth. In fact, if you subtract the costs to repair the ecological degradation caused by various sectors of the economy, no sector and virtually no companies are left with any net profit. \n\nSimilarly, economic growth has always been accompanied by and made possible by exploiting other people and nations. I love America in many ways, but do you have any idea how many countries we have meddled with, how many governments we have bullied and overthrown so as to enhance our corporations' bottom line and expand so-called free-market capitalism? \n\nAll that may be a harsh reality to have to face after the fairy tales that Milton Friedman or the Wall Street Journal or Fox News have told us, but it's still the truth. \n\nCapitalism has always been a looting mechanism: Could we have possibly built the financial empire we built in the U.S. without stealing an entire land mass from the Native Americans, enslaving Africans for centuries, and looting the raw materials of other nations via gunboat diplomacy? Of course not--America as we know it simply wouldn't exist: Hell, the slaves even built much of the White House, the Washington Monument, the southern railroads and so on.   Read a little history to learn how the UK exploited and cheated India to get their own textile industry going and even taxed the salt on India's own land just to grow their own empire. \n\nBut the broader and more important point is that the core goals, values, and principles of industrialized capitalism and consumerist lifestyles are flatly incompatible with meeting the needs of everyone and with avoiding ecological collapse. Just to avoid ecological collapse will require shrinking the footprint of the global economy by ~50% and it never growing again. We can partly decouple GDP from footprint, but only partly, so than means once GDP and our corresponding footprint gets above a  certain size, the economy must stop growing our ecosystems, our civilization, and our population will all collapse. \n\nSorry, those are just the laws of nature--I know that's a rude awakening given that we have been living according to all sorts of fairy tales about endless growth and progress. \n\nTake care.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Half the world's previous coral reefs are now dead due to man made global warming, the permafrost is collapsing in places, and forest from the Rockies to Siberia, the Amazon and elsewhere  have declining health due to man-made global warming. Species extinctions and crop failures are up due to global warming (with help from pollution and ecosystem destruction). This is about saving all the life on earth we can still save. \n\n\"It is continuously confirmed that the climate movement is the domain of the Left.\" You are entitled to your opinions but you are not entitled to your own facts. Back in the 1980s, and parts of the 1990s and even 2000s, leading GOP figures openly admitted that man0made global warming was going on and we had to do something about it. They are on videotape saying as much. Then their wealthy campaign donors--especially fossil fuel companies got very unhappy with them and suddenly GOP candidates did an about-face and started toeing the Exxon/Mobil company line (and saying some truly nutty and unscientific things about global warming).  At the same time, billionaires and oil companies started dumping up to $200 million a year to spread climate disinformation--sheer corporate propaganda that is easily disproven by the sound science. But clever propaganda works, and now you are repeating back to me some of the talking points from that expensive propaganda campaign. Do you realize that the GOP is the only major conservative party on Earth still engaging in pretending that man-made global warming isn't real and dangerous? \n\nSorry, but there outside of the GOP echo chambers and in the real world of science, there is a solid chain of evidence PROVING human activity caused ~100% of net global warming over the 1880-2020 time span, all the major predictions of the theory of man-made global warming have come true, and 14 different climate models, some dating back to the 1970s and 1980s--have accurately predicted how much our emissions would warm the Earth. That debate is over among all but the most ideologically-blinkered climate scientists (e.g., the scientists who work for oil companies).\n\n\n\n\"I prefer to side with rational, objective people who embrace vision and courage over fear and hysteria.\" I have vision and I have courage, but if you aren't scared about what we are doing to the Earth, you don't know the science. We have already destroyed half of Earth's biomass, including half the forests, more than half the marine life, and more than half the wild mammals. As Earth's biomass goes down, it can support fewer and fewer of us--and at lower and lower standards of living. So if you want to avoid the mud hut--and I sure do--you leap into action to bring human's collective footprint within the limits of Earth's carrying capacity. Our predicament is much like a family who has a million dollars in the bank, and we make $100K a year but we are spending $175K a year--the faster we bring our spending in line with out income, the more principal we can preserve. The longer we keep living beyond our/earth's limits, the closer we come to bankruptcy/ecological collapse. \n\nThe path we are on now leads to  a massive ecological collapse--this is well understood among scientists, and in fact, they have been issuing warnings about this since the early 1990s. Plankton populations are down 40% since the 1950s, insects and bird populations are down sharply, the rates of amphibian extinctions have been astronomical, in some places 99% of green sea turtles are being born female due to global warming, the Earth shifted from a brief period of global greening due to more CO2 to a global browning trend due to hotter and drier conditions starting around 2000. Dead zones in the oceans now numbers in the hundreds, and oxygen levels are starting to drop in the oceans, etc. etc. \n\nSorry my friend, but those are the facts on the ground. In physics, actions have consequences, so when you increase the level of something called \"greenhouse gases\" by 50%, it gets warmer. In life science, actions have consequences, so when you churn out endless chemical and plastic pollutants, destroy most natural habitat, and rapidly make the Earth warmer than it has been for tens of thousands of years, things unaccustomed to hotter and drier conditions die.

{"cid": "Ugx7-03B1ojOD51AScx4AaABAg", "text": "The AGW anthropogenic global warming hypothesis and the alleged Greenhouse Gas Hypothesis are in the same category with the Fake Space Programme. Money is calling all the shots. Scam after scam after scam. Some one some where is making a lot of money out of all of this silliness. \n\nIS SPACE TRAVEL REALLY POSSIBLE ? This question might appear to be a million light years away from the subject of VAMPIRES and other such GOTH things. However, I have heard it said that aliens might be vampires, coming from outer space, to attack the Earth, so as to be turning us humans into captive farm animals, for the harvesting of our ADRENOCHROME. This, believe it or not, is what certain UFO enthusiasts, at MUFON, have been saying. Such a point of view is probably coming from the, counter intelligence propaganda machine, so as to increase government spending, on the military hardware, where by so as to thwart the perceived alien threat. Before his death, earlier this year in 2018, Professor Stephen Hawking, spoke out about the possibility of such an alien invasion. But, I want to add my point of view to all of this speculation about aliens. In my opinion, material space travel is 100% not possible. Therefore in my opinion we have absolutely nothing to worry about. How can I be so sure that material space travel is 100% not possible ?\r\n\r\nFirst, the sheer DISTANCE involved is a major problem confronting anyone wanting to go anywhere in space. The Universe is extraordinarily vast. Even the nearest star to our own, ALPHA CENTAURUS, is nothing less than four light years away. A very bright star, ALPHA CANIS MAJOR, SIRIUS, \"The Dog Star\", which we in the Northern Hemisphere can see in the southern horizon during winter nights, is no less than six light years away. Light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second, which translates as 186,000 miles per second. Utterly massive distances. Just the central hub of our MILKYWAY Galaxy measures 100,000 light years diameter. The full diameter of our MILKYWAY GALAXY spiral arms, is nothing less than 1,000,000 light years. The nearest major Galaxy to our own, is the ANDROMEDA Galaxy, and it is 22,000,000 light years away from us. Visible in the Northern Hemisphere, it measures eleven lunar diameters in the sky. Beyond that, there exist unlimited numbers of other galaxies, in all directions, stretching out to infinity. Any kind of space ship, capable of supporting such a journey, would be impossible. Simply 100% not possible. Food, water, air, fuel ? Getting it into space ?\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is the problem of RADIATION. Any such space ship would have to possess a massive shield hull, with in which would be our habitation hull, with all the air, water, food and fuel. We only have to go beyond, low earth orbit, to run into such deadly solar radiations from the Sun, as well as cosmic radiations from our galaxy, and other galaxies too. Just beyond low earth orbit we encounter the Van Allen Radiation Belts.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the engineering reality that ROCKET PROPULSION DOES NOT WORK IN SPACE like as the science fiction industry would have us all believe. Only believe to be the truth, that which has been proven to be the truth, by the scientific method. The problem of propelling a space ship is in the fact that space is a perfect vacuum. Thus the rocket has nothing to push against. Propulsion requires that there be, DISPLACEMENT OF INTRINSIC MASS, equal to, or greater than, the intrinsic mass of the ship, being propelled. Ships on the water, have propellers that displace the weight of the ship, in water. The ship is displacing its own weight, in water, thus it floats on the surface of that water. Submarines, are also displacing their own weight, in water, thus, so as to be able to go up and down in that water. Aircraft have propellers or jet turbines that do the same, by displacing the air, equal to the weight of the aircraft. Then, as the aircraft begins levitating down the runway, the wings are producing a down draft of air, behind the aircraft. Thus, displacing air, equal to the weight of the aircraft, and thus the aircraft begins lifting off of the ground. A rocket spaceship, launching into the sky, is displacing its own weight in air, and thus it begins to float up into the sky. As it climbs upwards, the air, that was at its most dense at sea level, begins to get thinner. So that the efficiency of the rocket, gets less and less, until we are confronted by the vacuum of space, where in the efficiency of the rocket becomes, zero. Rockets only propel because of air displacement. Once in the vacuum of space, there is zero air displacement. So I have no hesitation in stating that, according to real science, rocket propulsion is 100% not possible in space. No air displacement, therefore no propulsion.\r\n\r\nSo, we are confronted by the realisation that the space programme is a scam. 100% FAKE ! This might not be obvious to most people, but it is crystal clear, to me. No one has, or ever will be, walking on the Moon. Going to Mars is utterly not possible. There are no rovers on Mars. No probes exploring the outer solar system. NASA is a huge scam. Over the years, since its founding by President Eisenhower and then with President Kennedy, in the 60's, they have improved on their ability to produce fake images, using cinematic tricks and nowadays high end, expensive CGI, which then feeds into the cinema industry and computer games. When President Kennedy set up NASA, and declared the intention to land men on the moon by the end of the decade, it were his belief that rocket science was able to achieve such a project. He had no idea that it was a scam. Wool, being pulled over his eyes, by the military industrial complex, spoken about by President Eisenhower. Then in steps, one brave young lady, called Norma Jean Baker, known by her actress name, Marilyn Monroe, who had worked in the aviation industry, during the darkest days of the Second World War, from 1939 through until 1945, before setting out into modelling and acting for the movie industry in her native California. Not just being a pretty face, she by arrangement, met with President Kennedy at the White House, and explained to him about the space propulsion problem. As soon as President Kennedy, understood, he took measures to put a stop to the NASA space programme scam. Why do we still have the NASA problem ? Because the military industrial complex, who run NASA, assassinated both of the Kennedy brothers, as well as killing Marilyn Monroe too. Down the years many scientists have either been corrupted or else murdered or both. Thus, NASA continues their scam, even to this day. It is time to reveal the truth. The scam must stop.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot ever travel in space materially, nevertheless, we can travel in space, spiritually. This is my approach, to exploring the Universe. Albert Einstein called it, the \"Folding of the Fabric of Time and Space\". When we sleep, and we dream, we are actually relocating our consciousness, to some other time and space coordination, in multi dimensionality physics. When we die, we are doing the same, as when we sleep, except that, we are not going to come back. LUCID DREAMING, is the only way by which we can really explore the universe. Unfortunately, because of their demonic morality, most individuals are, spiritually, Earth Bound. Only the genuinely righteous are, by the Grace of God, ever going to be allowed to transcend the earth. Read, the Book of Revelations, chapter fourteen, verses one through to five. Also read, The Book of Genesis, chapter six, verses five, six, and seven. By practice of Yoga Meditation, and celibacy, we can escape the reincarnation cycle, there by so as to become, Celestial Immortal beings, with the freedom to explore the universe. This process of becoming an Angelic Being, is called ascension, and salvation. It requires that we understand, PARTHENOGENESIS. We are only actually awake, when we are asleep, and we are only actually alive, when we are dead.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, I suggest to you, that there are no alien VAMPIRES, coming to invade the Earth, from outer space. However, the Earth is incubating a limited number of demonic vampires already. Material reality, is actually hell. Here we are in hell. The carnal flesh. We need to understand, that so long as we continue our demonic life style, we will remain as Earth Bound as ever before, and thus sink ever deeper into a horrific nightmare, in which we become vampires, attacking one anothers throats, for the adrenochrome drug, in the blood of the terrorised victim. Just how evil can it get ? Maybe, ADRENOCHROME addiction, has been what the military industrial complex, has always been about ?\r\n \r\nhttp://users.unitz.ca/napalm/The_Holographic_Universe_Michael_Talbot.pdf\r\n\r\n.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "DEEPBLUESKY", "channel": "UC47_6iT557oKH1fjQ3k91cg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/1LfFnD8jLOgFhw949QMI4OWmvOoNndhVbSe4g6kyxNw5N8ju_BtXdyV8H3goVaGwICRPTPG-yKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The point is what conclusions that people want to draw from them.\nFirst, the only temperature changes that take place according to climate change are roughly limmited to heights up to 3000 meters above sealevel. And they are not everywhere the same. It is an avarage. And there is the first problem, weather you support the data or not, avarages are calculable, but that is only a mathematical excercise. \nExample:\nSuppose I own 3 houses, one with only 1 room, the other with 2 rooms and the third with 3 rooms. I have equaly many houses with 1 room as I have with 2 rooms as I have with 3 rooms. But the avarage mathematics dictates that I sum up all of the rooms (1+2+3=6) and divede them over the amount of houses I have (3 houses), and voilá: I have an avarage of 2 houses. But tha avarage tells us nothing. I someone would ask me, knowing I own 3 houses what the avarage amount of rooms I have this person will think I own more then one house with 2 rooms as the majority of people uses \"avarage\" asbeing the most of them.\nSecondly, where in this 3000 meters of height do you want to place your temperature measurement equipement? Sealevel? Well, seawater likes to hold temperatures constant, so there is a chance you miss the higher (or lower) temperature changes that take place in for example to 100 meters high, or at 900 meters high.\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is not my fantasy, it is what I have learned when I became an engineer; do not trust data only!! You must also know what its context is. How was the data collected.\nMind; there still is nothing wrong with the data itself.\nHere another one: \nIn my country politicians do not talk about the avarage income, but of the modulair income: as we have a high number of true millionaires, the avarage income is quite high. The majority of people would have the impression that they are pretty poor.\nSo instead politicians use modulair income, the income the majority of the people have, which is lower. So, far less people feel poor and everybody is happy. \n(This is not a political statement but an explanation about how numbers work.)\n\nI am not a mathamatician, I am an engineer. I build ships. And those things work best if they stay straight up more or less. And here you have it: about everything an board there is exact data to be found, but does it help you to draw the right conclusion?!\n\nSorry for this long reply, and skipping the requested websites.

I really have not questioned this aspect of the science, as I have not seen many criticisms, other than the simplistic “the global mean temperature does not exist”, or from the handful of people who think the government meteorological agencies are conspiring to ‘fix’ the temperature records to show warming.  I believe that the global average is a weighted one, so hopefully it is not as problematic as the one in your example.\n\nYou mention “modulair income” – is that median income, or something else?

I heard the Sahara is just right for living conditions apparently. \n\nWe also no that warming isn't entirely due to CO2 but its a very significant part of it. CO2 warms the earth slightly which also warms the oceans which means that the water cannot dissolve as much CO2 thus more CO2 is released from the ocean starting a cycle of continuous heating. This heating reduced ICe in the Arctic which increases sea levels (which is happening) and also results is a small heating effect as the lower amount of snow results in more heat absorption by the sea. We are aware that there are fluctuations which is kind of the point of climate change and why we call it climate change.  There will be colder winters and warmer summers. You cannot compare the Antarctic and Arctic as if they are the same. Antarctica is a large mass of land with ice on top. the Arctic is not. There have been multiple studies that have shown how this is to the benefit of Anarctica. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to solve the CO2 issue that not only creates jobs but also improves the lives of everyone. A world with less smog so people will be breathing cleaner air. Nuclear is a good temporary energy source we can use until something like Fusion comes along. Wind and Solar are both effective if they have on-demand energy generation alongside them and the advancement of battery technology will also help. Nobody can name a single negative thing that investing in green(er) energy will cause. The only people that lose are the oil princes of the middle east. \n\n\nTo everyone, you can't stop with the 70s said cooling. It was still not the consensus opinion. It was an opinion held as the use of refrigerants resulted in a cooling effect however with the restriction of the use of these gases due to other atmospheric damage their release has been limited and it was proven decades ago that although it did create a cooling effect it would not undo the effects of heating my greenhouse gases like CO2.

There are variations even at identical latitudes. Carbon dioxide levels don't explain the variability. \nThere are papers on pub med that inadvertently bring up the real drivers for climate change. The biggest contributing factors to climate change are - Solar Activity and Geology (continental drift, volcanicity etc). Continental drift alters topographic relief of certain landmasses offer huge spans of time. This is why Scotland, for example, is full of old red sandstone. It used to be a hot desert. \nSolar activity is obviously a main driver because sunspot intensity and frequency determine how much heat reaches the planet. And volcanicity is another because only volcanic activity releases gasses on such a scale as to alter the composition of gases in the atmosphere to a significant degree in a short enough time to actually influence the climate.

{"cid": "UgyJtCskvPcIzTOO7Dt4AaABAg.9KGgLoMJTrt9KHBLeHwjcy", "text": " @John Wilson  actually I trained as one. I never pursued a career in research or education because there's no money in it. I decided instead to work in energy. So I do have some knowledge of the subject and without naming names I will say this. The 97% consensus is nonsense. In reality there isn't much of a consensus with respect to anthropogenic climate change. Some do \"believe\" in it. Others are skeptical. It's more like 50/50 when we consider the question properly. You see when Obama and the like (think \"scientists\" in the public eye, like Bill Nye - who is definitely not a real scientist, or Sir David Attenborough, who I believe is well intentioned but sadly has elected to jump on the climate change bandwagon because emotionally it has a greater impact - people generally don't give a shit about the natural world, but for some reason they seem to care about carbon dioxide emissions. It seems a convenient scapegoat and they are all for green technologies as long as consumerism isn't compromised. In reality it will take a lot more effort from everyone, including big companies in order to really have a genuinely positive impact on the ecological systems currently under actual threat. People only seem to care if the threat is pointed at humanity. It seems we are more species-ist than racist when it really comes down to it. Although ignorance is certainly the greater factor here, there is little positive to say about governments handling of these issues. The real problems of globalisation as it relates to environmental impact are largely hidden or only addressed using very few words. It seems that habitat destruction (which is a real and serious problem far worse than the impact of greenhouse gas emissions). What I mean by this is that the real threats are being glossed over with one that can be used to generate revenue. It's business as usual. The green energy industry is a cover thats not only worse than the fossil fuel problem in terms of direct emissions and environmental damage, it's also less efficient. Take for example Drax power station in the UK which moved to carbon neutral status with the change from coal to biomass. Biomass of course being wood chips. Wood chips from hardwood trees in Virginia. This is relatively old, stable forestry that's being destroyed to fire up a power station so that the UK can manage any dropout from the renewable energy (providing base load capacity and emergency additional capacity when renewables aren't producing enough to meet demand). This power station burns at present approximately 6 million tonnes of hardwood pellets per year. It's a false economy. This is happening everywhere that renewables are being used. The trees they cut down are part of a climax community. This is a stable and environmentally vital piece of woodland ecology. The destruction of habitat is catastrophic for biodiversity. But that's not the only issue. We know that cutting down forest destroys the soil environment and it becomes very difficult thereafter to plant trees in those areas. Fungal activity takes over, breaking down dead trees, this is often followed by disease in sapling trees and the new environment is generally less suitable for mature trees. There are many other impacts here. Also, with humanities tendencies to interfere with the environment we can't rule out the use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. Where trees are cut down and replanted we can almost guarantee that some kind of fertiliser will be used, possibly some kind of pesticides etc to ensure they grow relatively competition free. But this isn't the whole picture. Clearings left by felling are also more likely to be colonised by previously foreign plants and animals. This can alter soil conditions. It is also possible that GM crops from nearby fields would take advantage of that new source of natural light that wouldn't have penetrated the canopy of a mature forest. The implications and consequences are numerous and complex. Long story short, we shouldn't be interfering with these environments. Coal is also better suited to burning. It burns more efficiently and coal generates more energy per unit mass than wood of any kind. So why don't they just use the coal? They have coal here in the UK, it doesn't have to be boated across the Atlantic, local workers will have jobs. The environmental impact of burning coal locally is far lower than importing ecologically important hardwood, cutting it up, transporting it, drying it out and turning it into chips then loading it onto trains to simply be burned.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Walter White", "channel": "UCwA1HI02tS9ozC1V6YcsHUg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRYXjuLgO8WyDBDxzoQksE8jVR3_smKB0YeyA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Why is it that anyone who speaks out against the glaringly obvious flaws of supposed green energy or renewables gets lumbered in with proponents of oil and gas? Why is it especially that anyone who works in energy that gets tarred with that brush? And why do you assume that just because someone works in oil and gas they are somehow biased toward that particular form of energy? To answer your question more clearly I work in energy in general. Oil and gas, wind, nuclear. I've never worked in solar or geothermal and I've done some work in the hydroelectric industry briefly as well. I don't see why that's relevant. In fact it's a straw man argument. You assume that my profession says something about me as a person. I suppose in many cases it probably does. But that's a generalisation and not a very accurate one at all in this case. And what sets my opinions apart from those of many others is that I've not only studied the science, and I mean actually studied it, I've also got real world experience. I know how these industries work. I know how their assets work. I've seen the environmental impact of all of them in the real world. Do yourself a favour, watch planet of the humans. It speaks on issues I've been aware of for a very long time. The problem with most people, and I'm including you here because you've said nothing of substance (only made vague and pathetic attempts to attack my character in a condescending and passive-agrressive manner), is that they parrot sentiments that they've picked up from the newspaper or An Inconvenient Truth.

Feeling warmer is not scientific, yet the scientists here 'agree' it is feeling 'hotter'. Is this a consensus of what they feel?  That we spend 25% more time indoors over the last 25 years, we have more  air Con than 25 years ago, that we have kept our climate control thermostats colder than 25 years ago? The answer is absolutely yes, and yet the 'feeling' of hotter days has become main stream headlines. Everyone agrees..... For the exception of farmers who measure their heat units annually. Growing productivity, every year, their drying seasons reduced due to the lack of solar heat units and lower air temperatures. (Sorry, farmers are not scientists, yet the wait for their internet headlines to tell them that the climate is getting warmer.)

{"cid": "UgzkW_IwVsv2dyNZGhN4AaABAg", "text": "I am so sick and tired of hearing all of the BS about our planet warming. the cooling trend has already begun, from the past few solar cycles being extremely quiet compared to \"normal\". The lag in time from the affects of the solar cycles to be seen here on earth can take decades. So, since we are just beginning to see the cool down trend, i predict that it will continue to drop. this will not stop, it will continue to get cooler on average in many places on earth. If you ever want to know the upcoming weather of a season, just look back approximately 11 years (solar cycle) and the weather will be fairly similar. the intensity of the weather may be different than the last cycle, but the patterns will be very similar. the 2020-2021 winter has been very similar to 2009-2010. this past summer, was also extremely comparable to the summer of 2009.  so moving forward, if you live on the east coast, prepare for next winter (2021-2022) to be similar to 2010-2011.  the only differences i can see is that because our previous solar cycles were very inactive, the intensity will be stronger than the previous cycle. So be prepared for many nor'easters next winter, with the difference of more precipitation coming with those storms. Its so obvious if you look at the solar cycle graphs, and compare it to the weather you receive on these approx. 11 year cycles. Its not a perfect science, nothing is when we talk about weather, but it's a pretty darn good way to at least get a basic idea of the upcoming weather patterns by season.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Kerry Blackburn", "channel": "UCN65Rxgf8IwW9y_M6hmPY2A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ_vVu8S1rJA9V-4usq9tLpEu0HEbtqlcVx=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That has been done with the result that the superposition of just 2 periods explains the periodic trace over at least 200 years, including the apparent linear trent, we all argue about. Since the resulting spectrum does not correspond to a  continious spectrum of a straight line, you must rule out the validity of a linear data fitting.\nThat is the correct mathematical analysis.\nThe work was done by Prof. O. Weiss.

{"cid": "UgwD24YpN7uBU8FM_PJ4AaABAg", "text": "William Kininmonth knows what he is talking about. Except few people who have not studied climatology will understand what he is talking about or why it is important. Sad that some of the best scientists do not explain climate well. A couple additional graphs might have helped.\nBasically, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) produces as great a change in temperature during its short cycle of (5 to 7 years) as global climate change in periods of 30 to 60 years. That is because most of the Earth's heat from the Sun is stored in the tropical ocean and is only gradually mixed down to a depth of 1,000 or so meters (3300 feet or so), depending on geographic location and oceanic oscillations (currents).\n\nThe graph of the ocean temperature is hardly ever shown to the public. But it's the oceans that drive climate. The graphs like the one shown in the video that show land temperature tell us something about the average weather, but do not tell us much what the climate system is doing. \n\nWe have to study the oceans to do that. And the Argo system of buoys that measure the ocean have not been deployed long enough to do that. By 2050 we ought to have enough information from these buoys to know with some certainty how the oceans drive the climate system.\n\nNevertheless, based on studies of changes in ocean heat content, the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere has been calculated as 0.5 Watt per square meter 0.5 Wm-2). (The night light in a child's nursry is about 5 watts. And an ordinary candle about one Watt.)  One Watt spread evenly across a one-meter surface does not produce enough temperature increase to be felt by bare hands.\n\nThe amount of sunlight reflected back into space without heating the Earth is about 102 Wm-2. About half, 51 Wm-2, is reflection from clouds back to outer space. If cloudiness has decreased by one per cent (1%) in the last 200 years, that would explain all of the climate change now attributed to Greenhouse gases. (But does not prove that variations in cloudiness are what causes the climate to change.)\n\nThe drivers of climate change operate so gently that they cannot be measured directly. The errors in the estimate of energy imbalance are big compared to the power of the drivers. Thus, we cannot measure either cooling or warming directly. The result is that climate changes so slowly that decades could pass before we could be sure whether long-term climate is warming or cooling.\n\nLand and Sea temperature record compared\nhttps://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/graph_data/Temperature_Anomalies_over_Land_and_over_Ocean/graph.html", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Badger", "channel": "UCR-JIdhjRa9zYK-LodxG-Ng", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTr15SjWN9Y8amUSZKu96sl_oWcW-uZHfmWdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nearly three quarters of the earths surface is oceans and lakes that produce more water vapor into the atmosphere when the sky is clear and less when there is more cloud cover. The atmospheric water vapor we call clouds is at variable altitudes and the solar heat input to that is directly variable to the density of water vapor at altitude. The last I checked, water vapor is 100 times more efficient as a heat trap than CO2, and CO2 levels must DOUBLE to absorb 1 additional degree Celcius,  add to that the fact that only half of the planet is exposed to sunlight while half is in darkness called \"night\" when vast amounts of heat escapes into space from the upper atmosphere. There seems to be very little information as to how much heat escapes into space, but heat tends to move from hot to cold and I hear that space is VERY cold.

{"cid": "UgyyKvJALa8S6pvPQ3B4AaABAg", "text": "Have you noticed not much has been said about the Fukushima nuclear radiation leaks that are still going on and will still be going on for thousands of years to come in the pacific region? Nothing said recently about any clean-up of that major climate disaster. Very odd if Globalists are really concerned about global climate changes.\n\nDo nuclear power station melt downs stop once they are no longer reported in the news feeds?  Take a look at the potential disaster for earthquakes looming on the horizon in the general California location if tectonic plate shifts should happen to cause big Earthquakes near the San Andreas Fault lines upon which several nuclear reactors have been foolishly built on the US continent.\n\nLink to a relatively new channel as follows - showing some disturbing potential there for real global climate change on a possibly unprecedented scale:\n\n2/11/2021 -- West Coast / California Earthquake watch issued -- Pacific seismic unrest obvious\n204,767 views\n•Premiered Feb 12, 2021\n\nA spread of seismic activity is taking place.  The current unrest is spreading out and away from the multiple deep earthquake impact points (from Fiji to Japan to Indonesia).\n\nThe unrest has become quite obvious to even the casual observer with multiple M7.0+ earthquakes occurring in the past 30 days (in comparison to having none for months in 2020).  Additionally there has been a spread of M6.0+ earthquake activity reaching from the M7.7 location (at Loyalty Islands) Westward to Sumatra Indonesia, and as far North as the Philippines.\n\nWe should expect M5.0 range activity to strike along the West Coast (California bay area most likely) due to the plate slow slipping (ETS) taking place from Vancouver Island to the California border (thousands of tremors in the past 10-12 days as the plate is shifting).\n\nCentral and Southern California should expect new swarms going as high as M4.9 near Salton Sea , as well as similar sized movement to strike the California / Nevada border near Mono Lake again.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver Island) is currently still slipping with thousands of tremors.. which means we must be vigilant about the possibility of M7.0+ activity to develop out in the ocean on perimeter boundary surrounding the JDF (Juan De Fuca).  We must watch as long as the ETS is taking place up to a couple weeks AFTER IT STOPS (like 2012 for instance).\n\nOverall, things are picking up internationally with the multiple M7.0+ earthquakes , as well as the West coast USA being overdue for M5.0+ release, the two things together have me on a bit of an edge .  A slow slip can lead to a large quake above M6.0... and we are already looking for \"regular\" M5.0 range to come rolling out of the area moving.  If anything more comes in from Alaska (or if the plate shifts more)... we may see something much bigger than normal.\n\nSlow slips are the wild card.. we have to watch EVERY day on the slip to see if its coming to a halt, or if its carrying on moving.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "SOLOman", "channel": "UCywdfSRQ2r089SG2X4BBPUQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQLzWLpE6mKQTBYMukToDrwwjjbIxslDwCRrA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Unusual cold at odd times is due to the intrusion of cold air from the arctic.  (This is primarily a northern hemisphere effect).  Why is cold air moving south in larger amounts and at unusual times?  Because the temperature differential between equatorial regions and the Arctic is reduced as the Arctic is heating at two to as much as three times the rate as the lower latitudes.  Jennifer Francis predicted this effect as the Arctic jet stream is disrupted and distorted by weakening of the Hadley cells which assist in isolating air currents in regions of latitude.  The jet stream acted as a sort of wall against large amounts of mixing of hot, moist equatorial air and cold, dry Arctic air.  Their function depends on pressure differentials caused by differing temperature.  As the temp. difference diminishes, the effectiveness of the jet stream(s) diminishes and you get ridges of cold air pushing as far south as the equator, and hot troughs moving much warmer air than ususal into the Arctic, resulting in surface melting of Greenland, meltwater lakes expanding all across the Arctic, melting permafrost, heating of northern oceans, etc.  Heat drives all weather.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "kim weaver", "channel": "UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQOqrzQ85Xf5Ra1x-sW2PDUUv0sbKVzGXytlvfs=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The Sun creates the Earth’s climate.  \n\nAs we know, the Sun has a cycle of 11 years on average and as its activity increases, so does the number of spots on its surface.  The action of the Sun reaches the entire Solar System.  It reaches the Earth, which is mainly oceans.  There in the oceans, the Earth’s climate will finish cooking. \n\nBut the Earth has the Moon, so the action of the Sun that reaches the Earth is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.\n\nThe Moon has several cycles, of which, for now, we are interested in two of them.\nThe synodic cycle, from New Moon to New Moon and the metonic cycle. \n\nThis metonic cycle is named after Meton, a very wise guy who lived in Greece 500 years before Christ.  He realized that 235 lunations, i.e., 235 synodic cycles, were equivalent to 19 years, with an accuracy of less than two and a half hours. Very wise Meton.\n\nThis means that if on July 16, 2019 there is Full Moon, then in the year 2000 (19 years before), as well as in the year 2038 (19 years later), there is also Full Moon on July 16.\n\nThen we have a solar cycle of 11 years and we have a lunar cycle of 19 years.  If we multiply 11x19, we now have a cycle of 209 years composed of the action of the Sun and the way in which this action is modified and modulated by the presence of the Moon.  \n \nAt the peak of each eleven year solar cycle, its magnetic poles will exchange places. The north magnetic pole goes to the South and the south magnetic pole goes to the North.  So, the complete solar cycle is actually 22 years.\n\nAnd, then again: 22x19=418.  Two hundred years ago, the Dalton Minimum occurred and four hundred years ago the Maunder Minimum, the Little Ice Age, occurred.  As they say, we have these two trains arriving at the same time. \n\nLet's talk a little about History.  We currently use the Gregorian Calendar, a true masterpiece.  It has an error of one day every 3,333 years.  The Mayans had a slightly more precise calendar, an error of one day every 5,000 years.\nWe all understand the Gregorian Calendar.  Anyone can say how many days will it take for his next birthday or for Christmas.  The Mayan Calendar was understood only by priests.\n\nThe Mayans recorded important astronomical, political and social events on stone columns or Stelae and on the upper part of the Stela, they recorded the date of the Long Count in which the event had taken place.  The Long Count was a downward count and would have started 3,114 years before Christ, time in which, according to historians, there were no Mayans. \n\nA very clever english guy named Thompson, based solely on Stelae that recorded astronomical events, found the correlation between the Long Count and the Gregorian Calendar.  The end of the Long Count indicated the death of the Fifth Sun. \n\nThe Fifth Sun is the one we see every day flying high in the sky.  The Long Count ended on December 21, 2012.\n\nJohn Casey very accurately, almost exactly, said that the current “solar hibernation” had begun at the beginning of the year 2013.\n \nThe Mayans were dedicated to study Astronomy several centuries.  Because of the rudimentary nature of their methods, it is very difficult that they could reach the knowledge of the Long Count with complete accuracy.  I think this is a much older knowledge that the Mayans received and preserved. \n\nOf all the Grand Solar Minima that have occurred in the last millennia, none is comparable to the current one.  This one will be very much worse and very much longer. it will last hundreds of years. Maybe, thousands of years.\n\nWe will not enter in the future in a regular Grand Solar Minimun or in a Mini Ice Age.  Since December 21, 2012 we are in the biggest Grand Solar Minimun ever.  A real an long lasting BIG ICE AGE.\n\nValentina Zharkova, that brilliant and lovely lady, said last year that next Solar Cycle 25  will be very weak and will last only eight years.  This Cycle 25 will begin later this year or early 2020.  In her recently published paper she says: “Substantial temperature decrease are expected during the grand minima ... whose magnitude can not be yet predicted”.\n\nNow NASA says that Cycle 25 will be “the weakest of the past 200 years”.  Yeah, finally they noticed. Good boys. It will begin in April 2020 and will last 11 years. That is OK, but NASA has been cheating everyone and playing games with the man-made-global-warming nonsense, for too many years. \n\nSo, at the beginning of year 2024, the Solar Cycle 25 will be at it's weak peak.  From now, until 2024, the climate chaos will be growing faster and faster.  After that, we will be in a free fall, going deeper into the BIG ICE AGE.\n\nI want to analyze the effects of the other Moon cycles.  The anomalistic cycle, from apogee to apogee, wich precesses and makes a complete round in 08.75 years and the draconic cycle, that involves the ascending and descending lunar nodes, which precesses and takes 18.60 years to make a complete round. \n\nMore at: manuelesbri.com", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Manuel Esbri", "channel": "UCZM34jVSbunBJ1V4X6VfwvA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRuMTMhaIy6Oy67tyRudfzZz7aQr9OIbWH02rNdg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Wind turbines, for instance, are made of steel and concrete and one cannot manufacture them  without emitting Carbon and electric cars need to have batteries that have to come from rare metals which means it will be simply impossible to replace every car run by petrol with electric ones.

May I suggest you do some research and when you do you will find human emissions completely irrelevant.  Some numbers for you to consider.  There are 750 mega tonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere.  There are some 39,000 mega tonnes of CO2 dissolved in the oceans.  When the oceans warm due to the various currents like the Pacific and Atlantic decadal oscillations as driven by the sun some of that 39,000 mega tonnes is released to the atmosphere.  We release 6.3 mega tonnes of CO2 due to burning of fossil fuels.  Putting it back from where it came from in the first place, the atmosphere.  The Oceans due to calcification of marine life absorb 1.7 mega tonnes and plants absorb just 1.4 megatonnes.  There is 0.042% of CO2 in the atmosphere,  so low that Physicists describe it as a \"trace gas\".    At 0.02% plant life starts to die and at 0.016% all plant life dies and with it all life on earth.   In the past CO2 has been up at 0.70%.   CO2 in commercial greenhouses is run at 0.10% where plant growth rate doubles.    The greater plant life is on earth the more food there is for ALL animal life on earth.    Dr. Robert Holmes,  Physicist has proven that increased CO2 levels DOES NOT cause warming of the atmosphere.\nIf you do a Google search for Physical data to prove the case for human caused climate change you will come up with - nothing.

Marmes Man was an accidental discovery by Dr. Roald Fryxell, a geologist attached to the WSU Archeology Dept.  he paid a Cat skinner to plow a trench from just below the rock shelter into the bed of the Palouse River.  Those charred bones were exposed in the side of the trench, so Fryxell took them home in a shoe box, not knowing what they were.  ID’s came a week later.  Fryxell was busy joining River bed gravels with the detritus in the rock shelter above them.  This anchored the Pacific Northwest into a sweeping climate vector going to the WSU’s excavation of the buried Roman city of Italia, near present day Alta Mira, Espana!  Our guys went deeper than the Roman ruins, into ancient habitations on that site.  They found and described, the “Alta Mira Climate Flips”.  This is a 300 year flip, every 3500 years.  It kills civilizations right and left, and lines up with the return of Marduk-Niburu, into our inner solar system.  After these three centuries of tumult, our climate becomes either warmer and wetter, or cooler and drier.  It goes back and forth slowly, until it evens out in a happy medium for a millennium, until right now!  The last Nibiru flyby is described in the Bible’s Book of the Exodus, 3500 years ago.  This put paid to an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the previous one laid low pre-dynastic Egyptians,  circa 5000 years B C, or 7000 years ago.  You ain’t gonna hear any of this in the MSM, because it’s 100Proof School of Catastrophism Geology, and Prof. Fryxell died in a one car wreck, late one night, returning to WSU from Palouse Falls State Park, where he would bring his field notes up to date.  Much later Comet Shoemaker Levy Nine, calved and crashed into Jupiter, driving a giant stake into the theory of Gradualism, but today they are B A C K, with a hockey stick, no less.  Now it’s humans who are ruining those Gradualists’ paradise!  We won’t live very far into this flip which may have begun about when I graduated from WSU around 1970, but the X Rays coming out of one of our outer planets is probably a bell weather of a coming climate catastrophe which will demolish our modern world and half it’s population, within 250 years.  Kings, Emperors, Potenates, and wannabe Pharaohs, have always been top down Gradualists, so there’s hope for humanity to weather the coming great storm in our future generations!  But nowhere near 10 Billion souls will populate this world in the early 24th Century. FWIW, those Egyptian slave masters deliberately misled the Hebrews, confusing the Sea of Reeds on the Med, with the Red Sea.  The Hebrews Mis-read one hieroglyph for the other.  Of course Prince Thutmoses knew the difference, and it was the volcanic island of Thera, blowing its top, with maybe a flank collapse to boot, which is recorded as swamping the Egyptian Army.  The great hot wind preceded the tsunami, something which I experienced on the Wa. I’d. Border, two days after Mt. St. Helens blew up on May 18th, 1980.  I felt I was looking into the world’s greatest bake oven, over the plateaus and valleys of Washington State.  Thera’s winds and waves had a straight shot over open water to the beaches, just past the Sea of Reeds.  A flank collapse of the. Cumbre de Vieho volcano in the Canary Islands will introduce one of these killer waves to our exposed East Coast, and the Canary’s are much farther away than Santorini is from the Egyptian and Gaza Coastlines.

C&SF include charged particles which form an electric spiraling Birkland current, confined by its self-generated magnetic field which heats up its surrounding atmosphere. (In the past the climate models have only included the radiant solar energy which incidentally can be partially screened during the worst solar wind storms imposing the greater heat influx which has been blamed onto humans carbon footprint).\n\nBy all means stop the pollution from dirty fossil & coal-fired sources - otherwise concentrate on the destruction of the world's  best carbon sinks - our tropical jungles being destroyed by palm oil plantations for cooking oil and margarine etc.\n\n\n CO2 is not not the cause of fluctuating world temperature but is being blamed for it. By all means shut down all burning of polluting coal which has more nuclear residue than all the current and closed high pressure nuclear power stations.\n\nThe major cause of the fluctuating earth's temperature over the last 4 billion years is the cosmic and Solar Forcing, the greater majority of which is being completely ignored in current climate models.\n\nPart 2\n\nThe solution is a major worldwide campaign to build as soon as possible Liquid metal Thorium ion molten salt energy converters which are \"Walk-away Safe\" high temperature but near ambient pressure with virtually no nuclear pollutants. In fact a variation of molten salt reactors are capable of consuming the current nuclear \"waste\" stock piles which needs a safe storage for over 10,000 years to a miniscule amount of 0.02% requiring a safe storage for only 300 years while producing energy for the production of agricultural ferlilizer,  ammonia, jet fuel, Hydrogen for transport trucks & EVs, as well as electricity and desalination while creating valuable medical isotopes for cancer treatment. Indonesia will be first in the world with its 7×500MWe ThorCon liquid Thorium molten salt energy converters currently under construction.\n\nPrice to consumers will be under $US0.07/kWh while capitalised running cost is being negotiated at less than $US0.04 per kWh", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "MrVaticanRag", "channel": "UCu9cfP4cPCTbtjYrhamcigA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQXF_zsHyYiLeG8fJXeziq5j7Eogo7tf3BZJQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However, to use those charts as proof of temperatures rising above normal is deceptive and unscientific.  There are many other temperature records such as tree ring and ice core data that are able to show that we have had highs and lows throughout time and that we are simply experiencing one of those normal fluctuations.  Yes, man does have an effect on the environment and that needs to be addressed, but with proper attribution as to the effect we are causing rather than the blanket reason of global climate change.  Pollution must be curtailed, especially in countries like China and India where the rivers flow orange.  We also have to stop our attitude that we must ignore land to bring it back to a natural state.  This has caused massive desertification of land due to lack of removal of overgrowth.  There was a time when herds of Buffalo grazed the grasslands and kept them fertile.  Those herds are no longer there yet we do not allow cattle grazing that would keep the land healthy.

It is therefore much more that 1%. Emissions at a time t are irrelevant, the thing is that we emitted CO2 over time that wasn't (fully) compensated by an increase of CO2 sinks --> we are accumulating CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n\nAs an example (not exact numbers!), even if we are emitting  only 1% more CO2 each year, if it's not compensated by a 1% increase of CO2 sinks it will just accumulate in the atmosphere over time... That's what happened since the industrial revolution  (but the increase is not linear but exponential, at least at the beginning). The greenhouse gas effect is dependent on the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, not on the emissions. An analogy could be a bath (atmosphere) with water in (CO2 emissions) and water out (CO2 sinks). If the sum of sources = the sum of sinks, the water level (CO2 concentration) stays the same. If we increase water in (open more the tap), the level of water will rise over time!

The Earth has the capacity to sequester carbon released as these gases and has been sequestering faster than these gases are released. Even at the present 400 ppm by volume, the level of CO2 is not optimum for plants. 800 ppmv to 1600 ppmv would be about optimum.\nDuring the last ice age that ended about 12,000 years ago, the CO2 level dropped perilously low for plants and thus for all life on Earth. Below 150 ppmv plant life dies off and if much lower, all plant life would become extinct. \nLeonard Beadle in his book The inland waters of tropical Africa reported sand dunes under the Congo rain forest, indicating that at some time in the past the rain forest had died off. The level of CO2 during a previous ice age may have been too low for the trees in the Congo Basin.\nEntering the next ice age with elevated CO2 would provide a safety cushion.\nRelated evidence of the impact of low atmospheric CO2 during ice ages: Evolution of C4 plants: a new hypothesis for an interaction of CO2 and water relations mediated by plant hydraulics, Osborne, and Sack, 2012\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248710/", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Badger", "channel": "UCR-JIdhjRa9zYK-LodxG-Ng", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTr15SjWN9Y8amUSZKu96sl_oWcW-uZHfmWdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I stick with science and, it appears you don't know this, but science is all about  proving itself wrong and when it can't prove itself wrong it then makes a theory that has a high probability of being correct. That's the way we advance. So being a science guy, I don't gamble by backing sides, any side. And yes I am a leftist, and somewhat ambidextrous.

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner. Whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work. Professor legates peered reviewed paper debunking Cook:\r\nhttps://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/09/03/cooks-97-consensus-disproven-by-a-new-paper-showing-major-math-errors/?fbclid=IwAR3viWrFb4Zg-G3j6spcWgUiR0JQD046es9EVHnjV55w5Ejzi8HoivacM7I:\r\n\r\nCOLUMN: Al Gore Buys $8.9 Million Ocean-view Villa https://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/…/celebrity-homes-colu…\r\nHE WHO CAN MAKE YOU BELIEVE ABSURDITIES CAN MAKE YOU COMMIT ATROCITES !\r\nVOLTAIRE\r\nFORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST BOUGHT A $14 MILLION VILLA AT MARTH’S VINEYARD NEAR THE SHORE I LIKE, GORE, HE’S NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT RISING SEA LEVELS\r\nMan-Made Global warming is a lie !!!

We are all sinners and but for the GRACE of God, none of us would have any hope.  That is why JESUS came to earth and died on the Cross at Calvay, so that we can be can be saved.  I do understand your pain and suffering because I like you have gone through my own heartbreaking and painful experiences as well, but I have always tried to focus on others rather than myself.  My Mum, always telling me, \"Stop working so hard, caring, loving and doing so much for others.  Put yourself first for once!!  All I could reply was, \"I don't know how.\" That was my life, I actually had a great deal of Love to give.  It was a TOTAL Joy to me.  It kept me strong with my feet solidly on the ground.  I actually did see lots of joy and Love in the world because I shared it with others. I have my opinions, mainly coloured by my family's experience of living under a COMMUNIST regime, being nearly deported to the Gulags in Sibera in  railway cattle trucks.  You know what our Sin was? We owned some property which we achieved through hard work!!  We managed to escape just in time before they were coming to collect us to send us on our way to a Death sentence. \nOur lives have been filled with hard work and gratefulness for being able to live in FREEDOM. How long this FREEDOM will last, who knows, if the SOCIALIST/MARXIST/COMMUNISTS have their way!!   The things you about our food and other essential items we need every day being laced with poisonous substances are right. But, what can be done about?!  Most people know about these things and all you can do is read the labels and try to avoid what you know is harmful.  It is difficult, but doable.  I also take certain vitamin supplements which I feel I am not getting from the food I consume.  Perhaps you can try that too plus some Fish oil capsules. Magnesium is also very good. When we don't get the necessary vitamins from our food, our health and the feeling of wellbeing can go downhill very quickly.  Perhaps you need some guidance about this matter.  A health food store could help you.  I don't like to hear of you suffering and know that there are good people out there who could help you.  You just have to ask.  Please don't give up. We are all human and we all go through suffering throughout our lives, but you can either let it make you or break you.  In the end, it rests on each one of us individually and it is called Perssonal responsibility. \nI don't know if I have helped you in any way but I hope so. There are SO many places you could go to for help and so many kindhearted people who would help you but you just have to reach out.\nLike I said, the world isn't totally evil, there is the good amongst the bad.\nTruly WISHING you all the best!!\nPS:- I know there is good because I had a wonderful Professor fix my heart arythmia. Gorgeous, kind, caring human being.  There are so many out there just like him!!", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Livia MacLean", "channel": "UCZdRCWyEkv9rqtzsPUBsrmQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSds9ogMUU5Pk-22KXBmgiOezwfDTeup2YBjQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I happen to believe in THE HOLY TRINITY.  I believe in the LITERAL and the CREATION version of the BIBLE and I will ALWAYS stay clear of people who like to twist the HOLY SCRIPTURE to suit themselves.  So as it also says in THE HOLY SCRIPTURE, to shake the dust of my feet and walk away.   I will NEVER allow myself to be influenced in any way by charlatans.

I feel very sorry for you because unless you accept JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR SAVIOUR, you will NEVER be saved.  We can only come to the FATHER through the SON, who died on the Cross, for us.  HE loved us so much!!  We are all sinners and there is no hope for salvation except through JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.  \nI don't know which Bible your are reading but I read the authorized King James version. The Old and the New Testaments interweave with one another and make up ONE WHOLE. One cannot be without the other, especially in regard to Prophecy. I don't believe in taking out a verse here and there, on which to base an argument.  The WHOLE chapter needs to be read to make PROPER sense of it.  You made such a huge thing about the word BELIEVE, trying turn it into something EVIL, which it isn't.  It simply means to HAVE BELIEF in something.  TOTALLY simple.   I have listened now to what you have had to say, along with all the insults you have thrown at me and others and I know this conversation cannot continue.   The COMMENTS SECTION really  is'nt the place for it.  I would have to write a HUGE EPISTLE to cover everything and due to being very busy, I just don't have the time.  By the way, as I never abbreviate the English language, I have no idea what BTW means!!   If you wish to find out what I do believe in, all I can do is make a suggestion that you watch the program,  AMAZING FACTS on Television or UTube.

Three centuries of upheaval occur every 3500 years.  We’re into the beginning of a Alta Mira climate flip, today.  The last one is noted in the Book of Exodus, where Moses got his kin out of Egypt near the end of it.  Like Joseph preparing for seven years of famine, we need to batten down the hatches.  This occurs in the same time frame as the predicted return of a rogue planet called Nibiru/Marduk.  Roman statuary from WSU’s dig at Italia, a buried Roman city near Alta Mira, is now in the Maria Theresa Gardens in Seville.  Romans built cities on top of the ruins of older cities in strategic  localities.  These yielded seeds and pollen showing climate changes over millennia’s.  This flipping destroys civilizations worldwide from Egypt to the Pacific Northwest!  Prof. Fryxell was killed in a rollover accident returning to WSU, one night, and no one picked up his mantle.  Catastrophism isn’t welcomed by establishment  science, so the gradualists invented the hockey stick and blamed humans.

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner.

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner. Whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work.

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner.

{"cid": "Ugwh-Q8KYld6jQmc3cV4AaABAg.9Jd9IypGBQJ9JgFzGkycQs", "text": " @Mike Oz  Earth absorbs energy from sunlight, but as the surface warms, it also emits energy in the form of infrared radiation (which we know of as heat) out into space. Water vapor and CO2, however, act like a cap, making it more difficult for Earth to get rid of this energy. Without gases like these to absorb the energy, our planet’s average surface temperature would have been near zero degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAbout 99 percent of the atmosphere is made of oxygen and nitrogen, which cannot absorb the infrared radiation the Earth emits. Of the remaining 1 percent, the main molecules that can absorb infrared radiation are CO2 and water vapor, because their atoms are able to vibrate in just the right way to absorb the energy that the Earth gives off. After these gases absorb the energy, they emit half of it back to Earth and half of it into space, trapping some of the heat within the atmosphere. This trapping of heat is what we call the greenhouse effect. Because of the greenhouse effect created by these trace gases, the average temperature of the Earth is around 15˚C, or 59˚F, which allows for life to exist.\n\nCO2 makes up only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, and water vapor can vary from 0 to 4%. But while water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, it has “windows” that allow some of the infrared energy to escape without being absorbed. In addition, water vapor is concentrated lower in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 mixes well all the way to about 50 kilometers up. The higher the greenhouse gas, the more effective it is at trapping heat from the Earth’s surface.\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels affects the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Before the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere was about 288 ppm. We have now reached about 414 ppm, so we are on the way to doubling the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by the end of this century. Scientists say that if CO2 doubles, it could raise the average global temperature of the Earth between two and five degrees Celsius. We are already increasing the amount of energy that bounces back to the Earth. Because of the greenhouse effect, this is causing global warming with its many destructive impacts.\n\nBoth water vapor and CO2 are responsible for global warming, and once we increase the CO2 in the atmosphere, the oceans warm up, which inevitably triggers an increase in water vapor. But while we have no way to control water vapor, we can control CO2. And because we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by continuing to burn fossil fuels, even in relatively small amounts compared to the entire mass of the atmosphere, we are disturbing the entire heat balance of the planet.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Ants Field", "channel": "UC1hV8PBdKLbegoEWK-ZdVnQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRUo9Z_5dyoN9KHt4fLo7lr2JeOZjUXtFSxiw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner. Whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work.

{"cid": "UgylgRyVT4ly00yhspN4AaABAg", "text": "The following is happening in our World and no one is noticing.\n\n1. Armageddon is about 4 action events.\n   1st horse, Bow = Send it.\n   2nd horse, Sword = Strike it.\n   3rd horse, Scales = Split it.\n   4th horse, Fire = Sear it.\n\n   That ='s Our planet for the last 2 years have averaged 3.23 Rockets a day into space.\n   That's hundreds of rockets we've *Send*/sent up.\n   We've sent close to a 1000 Rockets/with Elon saying he's sending another 1000.\n   They are weapons designed to stop \"Wormwood\" in the book of Revelation in the Bible.\n   All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.\n   Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.\n   \"Wormwood\" is going to hit the PACIFIC OCEAN. *EVACUATE*.\n   All the ELITE TOP COMPANIES ARE EVACUATING THE PACIFIC COASTS...SO SHOULD YOU!!!\n\n2. \"The mark of the beast\".\n \n    Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.\n    But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.\n    The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands.\n    It will try to alter Chromosome 7 lamb1.\n    It is during these moments where the Bible mentions: You will wish the mountains to fall on you.\n    And this is also the moment where the Bible mentions: The \"few\" and the \"many\".\n    \"Few\" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and \"many\" will live (billions).\n    This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.\n    That is the moment of the \"delusion\" mentioned in Revelations. \n    If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.\n    You will wish the \"mountains to fall on you\".\n    666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  Six species of human corona viruses are known , \n    with some species subdivided into two different strains,     \n    making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.\n\n    Rev. 13:16 is referring to those who DIDN'T make the rapture of the church (The \"born again\" PEOPLE). \nWhat you and I are discussing is correlated with the 4 Horsemen (the timing).  \n1st Horseman is the Bow (SEND it). < That Horse rides as we speak. All the Rockets this Planet SENDS into Space are Weapons of mass Destruction targeted at \"Wormwood\". For almost 2 years now our Planet as sent almost 1000 Rockets into space and now we are averaging 3.23 a day. Elon just boasted within the past month how he intends to send a 1000 more.  \nBEFORE those ROCKETS touch \"WORMWOOD\", 2 EVENTS will happen.\n1 Event will be the \"RAPTURE\" and 1 will be the \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\". < BOTH OF THESE EVENTS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.  < The \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\" is the reason it happens.\n\nI have to stop here and explain something.\nOur Souls are physically attached to Our flesh by Chromosome 7 lamb1.\nWhen a Person (truly) becomes \"BORN AGAIN\" Chromosome 7 lamb1 CHANGES.\nSo now you have 2 different groups of People on the Planet. Those who are \"born again\" w/the altered \"lamb1\" and those who don't. \nNow having said that. When the \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\" lands on your forehead and hands, it's going to try and alter Chromosome 7 lamb1 AGAIN.\nWhen it does, ONLY those who are \"BORN AGAIN\" will die. Those who don't have the altered \"lamb1\" will LIVE...and be able to buy and sell during the TIME OF THE ANTICHRIST.\nThe \"BORN AGAIN\" People are people who have God's Holy Spirit INSIDE THEIR SOULS.  God's Holy Spirit isn't on this planet during the 7 years of the antichrist. His Spirit is raptured from this planet BEFORE THE 2ND HORSEMEN RIDES!!!!!\n(I'm throwing pearls, you better be getting this). <<<<and all of that can't happen till the \"LAST SUPPER\" (see my \"Last Supper\" video on my channel) is over.\n\nThen the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Horsemen happen.\n\nSo once again. The \"mark of the beast\" is NOT A CHIP. \nITS THE COMING \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\".\nYou must be \"born again\" before the \"airborne\" vaccine is given or you will be here for the 7 years of the antichrist.\n\n\n3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelation 9:10.\n \n   There are satellites in space called HIVES.\n   Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.\n   They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.\n   CELL PHONES ARE HOMING DEVICES.\n   Buy cell phone Jammers now and be ready to save those around you when it happens. \n   Throw your phone and run if you feel in danger. Don't stand in the same spot.\n   Be prepared. Buy short wave walkies-talkies. They can have up to 5 mile capabilities. \n   They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above with their missiles (for 5 Months after the asteroid hits).\n   They were just tested against that RV that blew up Tennessee.\nThe reason the word \"scorpions\" was used? \nWhat the person saw was a vision and then it ended up in Revelation. The \"vision\" He saw was long cylinder puffy clouds streaming from the skies, lots of them and at the end of each of those was a tiny little missile, but to the person having the vision, to him it looked like a bunch of scorpion tails or should I say cloud TRAILS.\n\nPlease I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now.\nThere's a GRAVITATIONAL PULL HAPPENING. ( Wormwood (rock heading this way in space) of the book of Revelation in the Bible )\nFloods in the desserts of Saudi Arabia.\nBlizzards in Spain.\nHuge clouds, heavy rains and flash floods in Saudi deserts, Qunfudhah, Taif\nMass fires in Brazil.\nHot Spot - Ocean, & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano. 1/21/2021\nMass electrical storms in Turkey.\nHot Spots & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano.. 1/17/2021\nNeva River freezes, Saint Petersburg, Russia\nVolcanoes are activating around the Globe.\nSewage fountains out of drains during floods in Cochabamba, Bolivia\nAnd more...!\nLuke 21:11 \nThere will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.\n\nI don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help \nme tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered\non my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read.\nPlease at least do that. Nothing on my channel is monetized.\n\nFolks, we are SENDing rockets into space to STRIKE a rock that the book of Revelation in the Bible calls \"wormwood\" and when those rockets SPLIT a piece will hit right above INDONESIA in the Pacific Waters and it will rock up and down the FIRE RING of the PACIFIC sending LAVA TO THE SKIES which will SEAR 2/3rds of this PLANET.\n\nI'M BEGGING YOU, HELP ME WARN OTHERS!\n\n\nYou're thinking how can you believe me?\nI'm the guy who God showed where His Garden of Eden was ( I can backup those words if you come to my channel).\nSOON A GLOBAL king WILL APPEAR, DON'T FOLLOW him he IS THE ANTICHRIST!\n\nNOTE: SOON SOCIAL MEDIA WILL DISAPPEAR GO TO MY CHANNEL AND COPY MY COMMENTS AND VIDEOS SO YOU CAN SHARE WITH OTHERS ON DISKS. NOT ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE HEAVEN (THE RAPTURE), YOU'LL BE THE REVOLUTIONIST FOR JESUS DURING THE 7 YEARS OF THE ANTICHRIST. BE READY TO HELP OTHERS. DURING THE 7 YEARS, THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE HEAVEN IS TO BE A MARTYR FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THE PAIN YOU FEEL. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOUR SCARED. YOU ONLY DO IT BECAUSE YOU REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE YOU MADE AND NOW YOUR WILLING TO GIVE YOUR LIFE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. BE BOLD IN THOSE DAYS, OTHERS WILL BE WATCHING YOU AND WHAT YOU DO WILL INFLUENCE THEM. MAKE WISE CHOICES MY FRIEND. THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN HEAVEN EACH TIME SOMEONE COMES TO THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS. DON'T LET EVIL STEAL YOURS AWAY FROM YOU.

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner. Whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work. Professor legates peered reviewed paper debunking Cook:\r\nhttps://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/09/03/cooks-97-consensus-disproven-by-a-new-paper-showing-major-math-errors/?fbclid=IwAR3viWrFb4Zg-G3j6spcWgUiR0JQD046es9EVHnjV55w5Ejzi8HoivacM7I:\r\n\r\nCOLUMN: Al Gore Buys $8.9 Million Ocean-view Villa https://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/…/celebrity-homes-colu…\r\nHE WHO CAN MAKE YOU BELIEVE ABSURDITIES CAN MAKE YOU COMMIT ATROCITES !\r\nVOLTAIRE\r\nFORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST BOUGHT A $14 MILLION VILLA AT MARTH’S VINEYARD NEAR THE SHORE I LIKE, GORE, HE’S NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT RISING SEA LEVELS\r\nMan-Made Global warming is a lie !!!

These are normal cycles with this being the approx. 12,000 year cycle. Expect more crazy weather as the magnestosphere continues to weaken at an excellerated pace as the pole shift takes place. This solar minimum will deteriorate into a grand solar minimum by 2030 and likely plunge Earth into at least a mini iceage. ALL indicators are confirming that will occur.

So they cut the time in half and repeated the experiment.  Again C14 was EVERYWHERE.  So they cut the time in half AGAIN.  This went on for a number of repetitions.  It was not until the exposure time was down to the microseconds that they were able to track the steps that carbon dioxide took between absorption and showing up as cellulose.  In the space of one or two microseconds carbon went from absorption to cellulose through about a hundred different stages.  In a few microseconds!!\n\nIt suddenly hit me like a thunderclap what that meant.  It was the AVAILABILITY of CO2 that was the limiting factor for the growth of plants.

Then listen to the words of former United Nations climate official Ottmar Edenhofer:\n\n“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015.\n\nSo what is the goal of environmental policy?\n\n“We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy,” said Edenhofer.\n\nFor those who want to believe that maybe Edenhofer just misspoke and doesn’t really mean that, consider that a little more than five years ago he also said that “the next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the world’s resources will be negotiated.”\n\nMad as they are, Edenhofer’s comments are nevertheless consistent with other alarmists who have spilled the movement’s dirty secret. Last year, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, made a similar statement.\n\n“This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution,” she said in anticipation of last year’s Paris climate summit.\n\n“This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.”\n\nThe plan is to allow Third World countries to emit as much carbon dioxide as they wish — because, as Edenhofer said, “in order to get rich one has to burn coal, oil or gas” — while at the same time restricting emissions in advanced nations. This will, of course, choke economic growth in developed nations, but they deserve that fate as they “have basically expropriated the atmosphere of the world community,” he said. The fanaticism runs so deep that one professor has even suggested that we need to plunge ourselves into a depression to fight global warming.\n\n\n(me) btw, the sun is going thru a cooling  (minimum) cycle right now. 99.99999...% of our thermal energy comes from the sun.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "TheDaveinga", "channel": "UCfLcY6OcN0DCg9XZ05Cn1yw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKHU87x_9CnAt2hX-C7gaslYGy1FQJGpuDBA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You can always take the upper range of predictions and lie on that basis I suppose. Even the older models from the 1970s were predominantly accurate and where there is inaccuracy they perform remarkably well when you adjust for discrepancies between assumed fluorocarbon levels, which changed due to policy driven reductions, and actual levels. Both the models'  predictions and hindcasting performance show them to be accurate. The \"skeptics\" never reveal that discrepancies between assumed CO2 output and actual output account for any discrepancies in prediction. The basic correlation between CO2 emissions and temp has been shown with quite a degree of confidence.

(what they were saying in the 70's) (Global Cooling)\"\nThe scientists never said so, maybe just some MSM journalists! The reason why the Earth wasn't warming (40s till 70s) is well understood: POLLUTION. The rise in sulfate aerosols was largely due to the increase in industrial activities at the end of the second world war, and aerosols have a cooling effect! The effect was hiding the warming effect of greenhouse gases, the latter being already the main concern of climate scientists!\nThanks to the clean air acts introduced in Europe and North America, we reduced our emissions of sulfate aerosols, which is explains why the warming trend resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\"If you've ever bothered to look at the correlation of Earth's Temp and CO2 levels, you would have noticed that until humans invented fire, throughout all of history CO2 always trailed behind Temp\".\nCome on, the Earth system is much more complex than that! What if I tell you that the solar forcing can be the trigger (for example to get out of a glacial cycle) and then CO2 acts as a positive feedback and enhances the initial increase of temperature due to solar forcing? Temperature and CO2 levels are not totally independent! You should definitely read more about feedbacks, triggers, tipping points, ....\n\n\"Also if you've bothered to look at Earth's average Temp, you'd know that we're still 10 degrees below average. Technically we're in an Interglacial Period of an Ice Age\"\nWhy comparing with a time when the Earth was totally different? Why would it be a proof that we can't be responsible for the recent warming? Have you looked at the totally different timescales? Do you think a fast transition would be favorable for the ecosystems and the civilisations?  Yeah, the Earth was hotter and DIFFERENT back then: so what? Does it diminish the current effects of global warming / climate change?\n\nI think I'm gonna give up, you anyway think that scientists are paid to lie to you. I can tell you that I would have NEVER chosen this job if money was my first concern! I would have stuck with my engineering degree.\n\nHave a nice evening (maybe day for you).", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Christophe Espic", "channel": "UCXdgMYMXAW_0_t5n1SPcZ0w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQIa4hvzhACFf3VpIw0cOgkDGZdWlPtC6wl2Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Members of Moriah’s (Moriah = the Illuminati)\n Luciferian elite will have undergone as much trauma as other slaves, \nhowever the torture scars and the control are better concealed. \nThese children will often receive lavish experiences as well as talks to convince them\n that they are part of the elite. (By the way, body scars will show up better under black light, \nthat is the same black light as used in clubs.)  Biden's \"Freedom Train\" is the code word\n for the Monarch trauma-based mind-control. \nTo be thrown from the Freedom Train means to be killed.) \nThe CIA and the Illuminati are skilled at blackmailing parents to give up their children. \nThey would watch the mail for porn. \nPedophile and murderers who abuse their children are warned that they will go to prison \nfor long lengths of time if they do not cooperate by selling their children into mind-controlled slavery. \nin return for the parent’s cooperation, they provide rich financial rewards to the parent(s).\n It’s clearly a case of \"if you don’t cooperate you lose in life big time, \n if you do cooperate you win big time.\" \nMinisters are often set up with Betas (a sexual model) who then blackmail them. \nThe ministers do not want to lose their status and profession via scandals, \nso they agree to turn their children over when young to the CIA to work with. \nThe Illuminati like to blackmail these ministers when they are finished with their Seminary schooling \nand committed to the ministry.\nThe idea of having nothing to fall back on '\nafter they have committed their entire life to one profession is too much for these weak willed men, \nand they buckle under the threats. If they don’t buckle under, \nthe resulting consequences will remove them from ministry.  \nThe type of father who is most preferred by the Programmers \nto offer up their children for programming is the pedophile.\n If a father will abuse his own little baby girl, then the Programmers\n know that the man has no conscience. \nThis father’s involvement in criminal activity (and thereby his vulnerability) \ncan be continually increased. \nThey want men who they believe will not develop any qualms later on in life about what they have done. \nA man, who waits until his daughter is a teenager to molest her, is usually esteemed \nto have too much conscience for the programmers.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Tomi Connelly", "channel": "UCquisVrdju8UejSULhCDFeA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRIXgU19h0jl_QZLyWe6GNsgIggYDQpDcyItS47jg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzCNLHwOCYIHaQczTd4AaABAg.9JW8pCitQkw9J_6l3CIwzP", "text": " @Walter Dayrit  Not true. The mammoth and several other species have died out at the end of the last ice age about 10000 years ago in a relatively short period of time. There weren't many humans, no modern civilisations, no planes, no cars. Or we can talk about the early medieval times when it was much warmer in the UK for example. The monks had vineyards in and around London. There are street names today that reflect that. It is very hard to imagine today, if you know that we normally have two weeks of real summer every year in the uk.\n Climate can change quite rapidly. I think it's our greatest arrogance to assume that we humans can cause the weather to change. We can make animals go instinct if we over hunt them, we can cut the trees in the Amazon forest, we can pollute the water with plastic but all these things won't change the climate. We simply are making our environment less healthy for ourselves. I think that we are making a huge mistake by concentrating on stopping the  naturally occurring climate change instead of trying to figure out ways to adapt to the changing climate. In the time of the first pharaohs in Egypt, the Sahara desert didn't exist. There was lush vegetation, trees, animals, rich land. It changed quite quickly in a relatively short period of time.\nI think what we should concentrate on is, for example the migration of people from Africa and other places due to climate change. In old times,  before the countries that we know today were established, there were mass migrations to Europe and in Europe. Back then if you had enough fighters, horses and determination you could save your nation by killing other tribes in your way. That is obviously not going to work now, so if we want to avoid a disaster we have to find ways to be able to survive or sustain life in dry and barren conditions. \nOn a lighter note \"The planet is fine.

{"cid": "UgzCNLHwOCYIHaQczTd4AaABAg.9JW8pCitQkw9J_eFo40Wze", "text": " @O Malley  Here an article from the Nature website:\nThey really were the Dark Ages\n\nA massive volcanic eruption brought gloom to the post-Roman world.\n\nPhilip Ball \t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t \n\n￼An ancient eruption probably caused the most severe global dimming in the past two millennia.Getty\n\nAn enormous volcanic eruption in the sixth century seems to have triggered catastrophic global cooling, perhaps precipitating famine, cultural conflict and plague across the planet.\n\nThe theory offers an explanation for why historical records from the period make references to dimmer skies and a cooler climate. Documents from Ireland, for example, describe “a failure of bread” for a few years after 536 AD, and there are also accounts of summertime snow in China. \n\nThe Byzantine historian Procopius wrote that in 536 “a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness… and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear.” \n\nScientists have been studying evidence of this cold snap for more than 20 years. Tree rings from this time, for example, show that growth was slowed down by cold weather. The cause of these climate changes has been controversial. Now, however, it seems a volcano was to blame. \n\nGlobal cooling\n\nClimate cooling is consistent with the idea that the atmosphere became shrouded in a haze of dust, as is known to happen after large volcanic eruptions. A dust veil, causing cooling and spectacular sunsets, appeared after the eruptions of Tambora in Indonesia in 1815, and of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991.\n\n“Any normal interpretation of the data would point to a volcanic origin,” says Keith Briffa, a palaeoclimatologist at the University of East Anglia in the UK and an author of the new study. But no one has previously been able to find clear evidence for that, leaving room for other theories. In particular, palaeoecologist Mike Baillie at Queen’s University in Belfast has proposed that the dust veil was created by a meteorite impact. \n\nNow Briffa and an international team of collaborators have found the characteristic fingerprint of a volcanic eruption in layers of ice in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, narrowly dated to around 533-536. They think that the eruption happened in 535, and that its effects were felt in the Northern Hemisphere in the following year, they write in the journal Geophysical Research Letters1.\n\nThis fingerprint takes the form of sulphate ions, formed from the sulphur dioxide released by volcanoes. Meteorite impacts do not tend to release sulphur into the atmosphere unless they happen to hit sulphur-rich minerals.\n\nThe fact that a sulphate layer can be seen not only in the northern but also the southern polar region implies that the eruption probably happened close to the Equator, so that its dust was dispersed all over the Earth. But the north bore the brunt of the climate effects – there’s no sign of cooling in geological records from New Zealand, for example.\n\nBriffa explains that, although it’s not hard to spot such sulphate contamination of ice in principle, the hard part is constraining the dates of the layers enough to link them to the tightly dated tree-ring evidence of cooling, and to distinguish them from sulphate that came from smaller but nearer eruptions. This careful detective work was carried out by Bo Vinther and his co-workers at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. \n\n'Most severe event'\n\nThe researchers say that the amount of sulphate they found implies that the eruption was even bigger than that of Tambora, perhaps releasing as much as 40% more dust. This, says Briffa, makes the event “the most severe volcanic cooling event in the Northern Hemisphere in the past 2,000 years”.\n\nSome have suggested that its consequences were more dramatic than mere crop failure and overcast skies. Around 541, a plague pandemic rampaged from southern Asia to Denmark, wreaking havoc in the Byzantine Empire and possibly killing about 40% of the inhabitants of its capital Constantinople. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis so-called Justinian plague (after the Byzantine emperor Justinian I) might have been triggered by cold weather, during which it may be easier for plague-bearing fleas to reproduce. After hearing Baillie talk on the 536 AD event, British writer David Keys wrote a book in 1999 claiming that the cooling reshaped global history, playing a part in the rise of Islam and the migration of the Mongols. Keys proposed that the cooling was caused by an eruption of Krakatoa.\n\nWhile historians think Keys’s case is tenuous, it now seems clear that a volcano did make itself felt around the world at that time. Now that the cause is clearer, says Briffa, “I think that historians may start to find more evidence of the event.”", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Walter Dayrit", "channel": "UCZ0nPVbv64UoDlPVSQ4x4wQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR3T9LqDjCfm_ZJOb9JyNC9ipsZTo0lt2NDAA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There are SO many things that could interrupt the delicate balance of our planet and guess what?  There isn't ANYTHING you can do about it to change it.  Holding in a few farts isn't going to stop the billionaires from flying around in their private jets, or stop China and India from producing more pollution.  If you kill manufacturing jobs in the US, they just move overseas where THERE AREN'T REGULATIONS ON POLLUTION (or the rules aren't followed), leading to MORE POLLUTION.  Oh, also, 'magnetic north' or the north magnetic pole has traveled 50 miles in 2020, and continues to travel AWAY from Canada and Greenland.  In the year 2000, it was right off of the coast.  Now magnetic north is in the middle of the ocean, centered between Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and Russia.  The position of magnetic north affects the amount of ice that will melt as it travels further away from land and in to the sea.  This affects everything but we continue to ignore everything that is going on with our planet, and outside of our planet, blaming everything on 'carbon dioxide' because we humans are gullible morons.

At night there is no ozone layer and a new one is formed during the day. The company that originally made the CFC coolant had its patent running out and competitors were getting their cheaper versions ready to flood the market. The company managed to find scientists to ‘prove’ the hole was caused by CFCs getting governments around the world to ban it, thus making their competitors stuff useless.

Does it distinguish between regular flu's and Covid?  Does it take into account underlying conditions?  How were the stats gathered?  There has been PLENTY of inaccurate reporting just in my city alone, let alone country wide and world wide.  Incredible how powerful that media is isn't it?

It was a two-question survey and only 5% of the people who answered a little over 150 were actual Climate Scientists. The 97% comes from an even smaller sub-set of 79 people who were self-professed Climate Scientists with 50% of their research being conducted on the subject of Climate Change. So that 97% figure originally came from 79 Scientists who agreed that the Earth’s temperature has risen since the 1800s and that Humans are likely a contributing factor. People used this Number and ran with it. When the evidence was running a little thin and people started questioning it in 2013 Australian blogger John Cook and some of his buddies reviewed some abstracts of peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 to 2011. What were his findings?: Coincidently that exactly 97% of Scientists either explicitly or implicitly made the assertion that Humans were somewhat responsible for warming not even Climate Change, BUT WARMING, his work was debunked as CRAP in Science and Education I August 2013. For example, David R Legates ( a professor at the University of Delaware and former director of it’s Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found “ only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.o percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent--- had been found to endorse” the claim that human Activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Morner. Whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work.

Idk where your getting your information but you should look at the opposite side of what you look up or read. I do. And I agree with those scientist , what they conclude is all in open to see with our eyes. Not hypothetical theories. The recent pole shift literally just caused the northern lights to move. Currents can change wind and water because of pole shifts. Look at all the volcanic activity around the world in the past 2yrs or longer. The big planet is wayyyy bigger than us. It's being ignorant to believe we are causing things these changes happening. There's been billion people civilizations here before us.

Alot of videos showing the planet from space exaggerate the lighting in order to make it look more beautiful. Be careful what you buy into because us humans aren't accelerating anything. Humans have always been here, civilizations as big as ours or bigger have already existed in the past. We may leave our prints but we do not affect the natural cycles of this planet. The sun has alot to do with it and from it's yearly cycles to it's million year cycles which we have yet to understand...same as this planets. He'll could be something further out there causing these changes. More astroids are entering our atmosphere more frequently than ever, quite a few big ones are flying closer and closer to us as they pass. We have had a pole shift recently, that's why the northern lights was doing things and moved for the first time in our time of history. Africa is on its way of splitting, the tetonic plate is moving. Volcanos all around the planet are waking up. They don't yet why Siberia is doing what it is doing, possible the rising of the warmer methane gas is causing the permafrost to melt but what's pushing it up? Pressure from the magma under those deep pockets? They do not know yet. I just know what I theorize it to be from common things happening around the world. It's logical to think it's the same thing affecting it in Siberia, which is the magma. Or maybe it's deep under ground water. Cause and effect can be created from opposite ends of the planet easily. Tsunamis have a way of doing that. We don't have the true answers yet to some of these things happening. But what I do know is humans are arrogant that way to think we can control or stop such things, and it's just as arrogant to think that we are able to cause such things way bigger than we are. Which some would say it's foolish to not think we can't. But I know we aren't melting the ice cap in antarctica, that's magma activity happening same as in yellowstone. Areas once open to public are now no longer safe as the roads are literally melting, ponds and lakes are boiling and methane gas pockets are being pushed out making the air unbreathable in a few of those areas. Any of that sound familiar? Antarctica and Siberia familiar? All of Europe is sitting on a magma chamber. Washington also, which that is also moving closer to the surface. They now believe yellowstone is the same magma chamber as washington. Underwater volcanic activity is happening now as we speak not even a mile off shore in washington. Tons of ancient writings and in what we consider mythology tell us these things have happened before. The hopi indian prophecy might be more accurate than we know, I think they say mother earth has passed thru 3 world's and we are coming into the 4th. With each new world the last is destroyed.  While scientist are saying things are speeding up, some think it's been happening in the last 100yrs and we are just coming to the end of that cycle. The dead sea is coming back to life, the change in the atlantic ocean currents could be part of that biblical prophecy. Right now it's underground fresh water causing the dead sea to replenish itself, but soon it might be the ocean currents that really bring life back to it as animals from land and water will follow the currents. These shifts in currents will push back on the fresh water rivers. Pushing them into places we haven't seen them in over 6000yrs or more.

The biblical body of water lying between Israel and Jordan is retreating by more than three feet a year, creating sinkholes that swallow up buildings and roads, and forcing the rich seaside landscape on which the tourism industry relies to fade into memory.\nIt is the saltiest sea on earth. Some experts believe it will be gone by 2050, while others say it will never fully disappear but survive at a fraction of its current size.\"\nAs for civilisations in the 'past' as large as our own currently...there is absolutely no evidence to support this only 'fairy' stories, biblical twists. I will accept the previous civilisations were advanced, populated and more advanced than we were taught at school. Indeed Eratosthenes of Cyrene calculated the circumference of a 'spherical' earth 250 BCE yet for many centuries the Western World were 'instructed' by religious 'Christian' zealots that the earth was flat......for the west it was a time noted as the Dark Ages yet for the East a time for mathematics and science. a time of enlightenment...I fear that the science deniers of 21st century are pursuing the folly of the past and procuring their own dark ages.\nAs for light seen from space may i refer you to  city-lights-from-space/#:~:text=It%20might%20surprise%20you%20to,are%20brighter%20than%20the%20stars. \nI will not question your right to believe what you wish...however please avail yourself to seek critical review of your own 'facts', where  they come from, how they have been challenged by peers, how some are presented by charlatans and snake charmers.....the one thing I will agree the ultimate survival of our planet is currently beyond our control...the  Sun will ultimately consume us, that incursion by other celestial bodies will cause catastrophic impacts, as they have done in the past. But as a survivor of 'dramatic' pollution by humans and the industrial revolution in the North of England....where sunlight was blocked by carbon ladened smog and children, myself included' taken to sun rooms to receive adequate artificial 'sunlight' to ensure optimal growth and development, where rivers had died from the poisonous waste of the woollen mills and the carbon 'fell' from the sky and covered the cream coloured Yorkshire stone with its blackness.. perhaps this is why the UK is more responsive to 'climate change' as a result of humans they have seen it first hand...ps I too have seen light from Towns and cities 3kms above the surface and also the illumination of the ignited gas on the flares stacks of oil rigs over Iraq.. I shall choose to accept peer evaluated science, well credentialed archeology, the power of mathematics but will always enjoy the romanticised and curiosity of mythology.....and sometimes we can fit them to reality.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Red Terrier", "channel": "UCfjaXFQ13qVmjjl6uPZEMzw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTyxD5YznOS0Mx3tVYL7dku8q6UC4kci5nULw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx7VTf0Zvf60h3CuQV4AaABAg.9JVOEbflQW_9JbFYkFqjNk", "text": "The following is happening in our World and no one is noticing.\n\n1. Armageddon is about 4 action events.\n   1st horse, Bow = Send it.\n   2nd horse, Sword = Strike it.\n   3rd horse, Scales = Split it.\n   4th horse, Fire = Sear it.\n\n   That ='s Our planet for the last 2 years have averaged 3.23 Rockets a day into space.\n   That's hundreds of rockets we've *Send*/sent up.\n   We've sent close to a 1000 Rockets/with Elon saying he's sending another 1000.\n   They are weapons designed to stop \"Wormwood\" in the book of Revelation in the Bible.\n   All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.\n   Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.\n   \"Wormwood\" is going to hit the PACIFIC OCEAN. *EVACUATE*.\n   All the ELITE TOP COMPANIES ARE EVACUATING THE PACIFIC COASTS...SO SHOULD YOU!!!\n\n2. \"The mark of the beast\".\n \n    Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.\n    But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.\n    The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands.\n    It will try to alter Chromosome 7 lamb1.\n    It is during these moments where the Bible mentions: You will wish the mountains to fall on you.\n    And this is also the moment where the Bible mentions: The \"few\" and the \"many\".\n    \"Few\" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and \"many\" will live (billions).\n    This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.\n    That is the moment of the \"delusion\" mentioned in Revelations. \n    If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.\n    You will wish the \"mountains to fall on you\".\n    666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  Six species of human corona viruses are known , \n    with some species subdivided into two different strains,     \n    making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.\n\n    Rev. 13:16 is referring to those who DIDN'T make the rapture of the church (The \"born again\" PEOPLE). \nWhat you and I are discussing is correlated with the 4 Horsemen (the timing).  \n1st Horseman is the Bow (SEND it). < That Horse rides as we speak. All the Rockets this Planet SENDS into Space are Weapons of mass Destruction targeted at \"Wormwood\". For almost 2 years now our Planet as sent almost 1000 Rockets into space and now we are averaging 3.23 a day. Elon just boasted within the past month how he intends to send a 1000 more.  \nBEFORE those ROCKETS touch \"WORMWOOD\", 2 EVENTS will happen.\n1 Event will be the \"RAPTURE\" and 1 will be the \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\". < BOTH OF THESE EVENTS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.  < The \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\" is the reason it happens.\n\nI have to stop here and explain something.\nOur Souls are physically attached to Our flesh by Chromosome 7 lamb1.\nWhen a Person (truly) becomes \"BORN AGAIN\" Chromosome 7 lamb1 CHANGES.\nSo now you have 2 different groups of People on the Planet. Those who are \"born again\" w/the altered \"lamb1\" and those who don't. \nNow having said that. When the \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\" lands on your forehead and hands, it's going to try and alter Chromosome 7 lamb1 AGAIN.\nWhen it does, ONLY those who are \"BORN AGAIN\" will die. Those who don't have the altered \"lamb1\" will LIVE...and be able to buy and sell during the TIME OF THE ANTICHRIST.\nThe \"BORN AGAIN\" People are people who have God's Holy Spirit INSIDE THEIR SOULS.  God's Holy Spirit isn't on this planet during the 7 years of the antichrist. His Spirit is raptured from this planet BEFORE THE 2ND HORSEMEN RIDES!!!!!\n(I'm throwing pearls, you better be getting this). <<<<and all of that can't happen till the \"LAST SUPPER\" (see my \"Last Supper\" video on my channel) is over.\n\nThen the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Horsemen happen.\n\nSo once again. The \"mark of the beast\" is NOT A CHIP. \nITS THE COMING \"AIRBORNE VACCINE\".\nYou must be \"born again\" before the \"airborne\" vaccine is given or you will be here for the 7 years of the antichrist.\n\n\n3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelation 9:10.\n \n   There are satellites in space called HIVES.\n   Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.\n   They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.\n   CELL PHONES ARE HOMING DEVICES.\n   Buy cell phone Jammers now and be ready to save those around you when it happens. \n   Throw your phone and run if you feel in danger. Don't stand in the same spot.\n   Be prepared. Buy short wave walkies-talkies. They can have up to 5 mile capabilities. \n   They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above with their missiles (for 5 Months after the asteroid hits).\n   They were just tested against that RV that blew up Tennessee.\nThe reason the word \"scorpions\" was used? \nWhat the person saw was a vision and then it ended up in Revelation. The \"vision\" He saw was long cylinder puffy clouds streaming from the skies, lots of them and at the end of each of those was a tiny little missile, but to the person having the vision, to him it looked like a bunch of scorpion tails or should I say cloud TRAILS.\n\nPlease I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now.\nThere's a GRAVITATIONAL PULL HAPPENING. ( Wormwood (rock heading this way in space) of the book of Revelation in the Bible )\nFloods in the desserts of Saudi Arabia.\nBlizzards in Spain.\nHuge clouds, heavy rains and flash floods in Saudi deserts, Qunfudhah, Taif\nMass fires in Brazil.\nHot Spot - Ocean, & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano. 1/21/2021\nMass electrical storms in Turkey.\nHot Spots & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano.. 1/17/2021\nNeva River freezes, Saint Petersburg, Russia\nVolcanoes are activating around the Globe.\nSewage fountains out of drains during floods in Cochabamba, Bolivia\nAnd more...!\nLuke 21:11 \nThere will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.\n\nI don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help \nme tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered\non my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read.\nPlease at least do that. Nothing on my channel is monetized.\n\nFolks, we are SENDing rockets into space to STRIKE a rock that the book of Revelation in the Bible calls \"wormwood\" and when those rockets SPLIT a piece will hit right above INDONESIA in the Pacific Waters and it will rock up and down the FIRE RING of the PACIFIC sending LAVA TO THE SKIES which will SEAR 2/3rds of this PLANET.\n\nI'M BEGGING YOU, HELP ME WARN OTHERS!\n\n\nYou're thinking how can you believe me?\nI'm the guy who God showed where His Garden of Eden was ( I can backup those words if you come to my channel).\nSOON A GLOBAL king WILL APPEAR, DON'T FOLLOW him he IS THE ANTICHRIST!\n\nNOTE: SOON SOCIAL MEDIA WILL DISAPPEAR GO TO MY CHANNEL AND COPY MY COMMENTS AND VIDEOS SO YOU CAN SHARE WITH OTHERS ON DISKS. NOT ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE HEAVEN (THE RAPTURE), YOU'LL BE THE REVOLUTIONIST FOR JESUS DURING THE 7 YEARS OF THE ANTICHRIST. BE READY TO HELP OTHERS. DURING THE 7 YEARS, THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE HEAVEN IS TO BE A MARTYR FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THE PAIN YOU FEEL. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOUR SCARED. YOU ONLY DO IT BECAUSE YOU REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE YOU MADE AND NOW YOUR WILLING TO GIVE YOUR LIFE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. BE BOLD IN THOSE DAYS, OTHERS WILL BE WATCHING YOU AND WHAT YOU DO WILL INFLUENCE THEM. MAKE WISE CHOICES MY FRIEND. THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN HEAVEN EACH TIME SOMEONE COMES TO THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS. DON'T LET EVIL STEAL YOURS AWAY FROM YOU. STAND STRONG AND WHEN I SEE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU A BIG HUG AND A KISS ON THE NECK AND WE'LL CELEBRATE FOR ALL ETERNITY!", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Hush Whisper", "channel": "UCQsmg2DvkGlWpv8hy5Hx8DA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSdL0mxfZXibXrZWNCG_2W3dB7AokubuOltYFYIow=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This was based on consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information available during the early stages of the outbreak. Now that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have reviewed the most up to date information about COVID-19 against the UK HCID criteria. They have determined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information is available about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase.\r\n\r\nThe Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) is also of the opinion that COVID-19 should no longer be classified as an HCID.\r\n\r\nThe need to have a national, coordinated response remains, but this is being met by the government’s COVID-19 response.\r\n\r\nCases of COVID-19 are no longer managed by HCID treatment centres only. All healthcare workers managing possible and confirmed cases should follow the updated national infection and prevention (IPC) guidance for COVID-19, which supersedes all previous IPC guidance for COVID-19. This guidance includes instructions about different personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles that are appropriate for different clinical scenarios.\r\n\r\nDefinition of HCID\r\nIn the UK, a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) is defined according to the following criteria:\r\n\r\nacute infectious disease\r\ntypically has a high case-fatality rate\r\nmay not have effective prophylaxis or treatment\r\noften difficult to recognise and detect rapidly\r\nability to spread in the community and within healthcare settings\r\nrequires an enhanced individual, population and system response to ensure it is managed effectively, efficiently and safely\r\nClassification of HCIDs\r\nHCIDs are further divided into contact and airborne groups:\r\n\r\ncontact HCIDs are usually spread by direct contact with an infected patient or infected fluids, tissues and other materials, or by indirect contact with contaminated materials and fomites\r\n\r\nairborne HCIDs are spread by respiratory droplets or aerosol transmission, in addition to contact routes of transmission", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "jr", "channel": "UCovuex2EiH3t_HPr66e5HVg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQpc8Ofhed4y0NyZnzNPfbC-65bNQHU7to8AQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The wind turbines are only good for about 20 years and then the blades have to be replaced and the old blades are then discarded into landfills and buried,  in which they aren't even able to decompose because they are fiberglass and don't decompose.  \nAnd then there is the fact that \"green energy \" can't even come close to being able to support the U.S. energy sector.

To not produce any co2 would actually destroy the planet.  CO2 is the common building block of all living things.  If you completely get rid of all co2 emissions, all life would die.  Plants absorb co2 as a form of nutrient and then changes co2 into oxygen.  If they really want to do something,  they should force the people who are systematically destroying the Amazon rainforest.  The rainforest produces approximately one quarter of all oxygen in the western hemisphere.  The more rainforest destroyed,  the less co2 is converted into oxygen.  There are several green houses in the United States that are specialized green houses.  They pump approximately 1500 ppm co2 into these greenhouses and they have found that this not only helps the plants inside,  but clear irrefutable evidence that the plants inside take less time to mature, but also produce more than twice the amount of produce than normal plants.  The co2 level occurring naturally is about 400 ppm.  To produce zero emissions is impossible but also dangerous to the planet.  Just like the killing of honeybees that is rampantly taking place.  There has been a drastic decline in honeybees because of insecticides and herbicides that are killing the bees,  which in turn will absolutely destroy the planet also.  Because bees are the primary and largest species of animals and insects that pollinate the plants so the plants can produce seeds for further growth of the plants.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Johnrob1943", "channel": "UC4Nzhw14ipFS5Kt_7xmpmMw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQIJYqEuJf61C3dK9ByBVFO8c3hm4YyaDnFGQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Carbon Dioxide absorbs infra-red (IR) radiation from the surface of the Earth only at certain wavelengths and converts it to heat, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\nIt has been shown (by German Physicist Heinz Hug) that at the current level of CO2 in the atmosphere, about 400ppm, that these wavelengths are completely absorbed in the first 10 metres of atmosphere above the surface.\nSo increasing CO2 concentration will have no further effect, because all the IR radiation which can be absorbed by CO2, is already being absorbed, very close to the surface of the Earth.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Paul Jackson", "channel": "UCpGDM0D75q_sLxFi8eB7tbg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR_FA0QpT35i8GXnF8bqdnOQ1Wbg1LWphL-UQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That's just one theory, among many other hotly debated theories, and the one favored by climate alarmists as it suits their false narrative  the worlds climate is rather stable, other than when driven by some external forcing e.g, volcanos, human emissions.  They are so set on 'proving' the climate was rather stable prior to CO2 emission started rising they were even prepared to falsify headline UN reports (research Climategate i.e. Natures Trick).  Michael Mann DID pressure his colleagues to falsify the data for political and personal power reasons.\nThat the Little Ice Age was only a local rather than global event is also a popular theory pushed by the climate alarmists to dismiss the importance of The Little Ice Age.

{"cid": "Ugzje5e-KUQz64YJ6RZ4AaABAg.9JVAGLOODjb9JVJttoxbSG", "text": " @Peter Johnson  There still is a hole in the ozone layer. As far as anyone can tell it's always been there. The interesting thing is that the majority of CFC usage was in the northern hemisphere. So why was the hole in the south? Did all the heavy CFCs drain to the bottom? And I won't even go into the insanely short baseline used for the panic.\n\nHowever and in all seriousness the hole has quite a simple explanation once you understand the processes involved. Firstly ozone is created by certain light frequencies hitting the atmosphere. This means that ozone is created between the Tropics as that's where the effect is strongest. Light in the Antarctic is hitting at a very oblique angle and so doesn't create much ozone in the polar regions. This is evidenced at both poles. In the north the ozone from warmer climes mixes with the Arctic air and replenishes the ozone. However the south has the \"Circumpolar Current\", a \"wall\" of air that effectively almost prevents ozone from the lower latitudes reaching the southern polar region. Hence with little ozone created there and not much coming from the tropics the free chlorine in the atmosphere from Mount Erebus causes the hole. Compared to nature we are nothing. https://principia-scientific.com/antarctic-ozone-depletion-due-to-erebus-volcano-gas-emissions/\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015304246\n\nAnd there's also the absolutely amazing coincidence that the ozone hole panic and the rush to ban CFCs came just as the patents were running out and India was about to supply the world with much cheaper CFC refrigerants. Of course, India couldn't do that and guess who just happened to have a CFC replacement ready for the market? At a slightly increased price, of course.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "JohnJ469", "channel": "UC9JHU3fM9XzrTKS70BJgb3w", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRWJ8qD8xyVimlj5zNjk9ET_GfpHvKqXJOPnw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

At some point, weathering binds more Co2 than being produced and the next cold-period starts (we talk 9000year rhythm between warm/cold-periods, proven by ice drilling). So if we see an increase in temp. we should see more weathering, therefore I doubt that we accelerate the warming and even if we do, it should balance itself out by accelerated weathering.

So just taking what you have written as a standalone comment (which I acknowledge may not do justice) ......\nYou don't need to \"show me another side\".  Everyone knows the 'other side', it has been thrust down our throats, other than a brief respite for covid paranoia, every day for years.  \nYes, mankind hasn't been harmonious with nature, and that why I'm a committed conservationist.  BUT, there is a VAST difference between being a committed active environmentalist, and political actors using CO2 to bring about radical social change that will do next to nothing for the environment.\nYou will not win hearts and minds describing anyone with a different perspective on the best way to tackle the very many environmental issues facing us as \" arrogant, ignorant or complacent around the issue of ecosystem dislocation.\"  That's the typical response used by political motivated 'climate extremists'.  Anyone who doesn't fully subscribe to their narrow and often inexperienced view of the world lacks the supreme 'education', 'enlightenment', or 'intellect' they believe they uniquely possess.\nNot subscribing to the CO2 paranoia is not \"doing nothing\".  In fact people like me believe it highly counterproductive as trillions of dollars are wasted on unproductive ventures where the money could be far better spent on issues that will have a very real and lasting impact on the environment.  Cleaning the plastic from the oceans, or diverting water inland in Australia to stop the environment have to compete with farming irrigators for a scare resource on the driest continent on earth are examples.   The environment will always loose in that last example, where our major inland river system come to a near stop full of toxic algae and suffocated dead fish by the millions due to lack of water flow.   But closing a coal fired power station 1000 kilometers away is somehow going to fix the problem.  It won't, it'll do NOTHING for the environment, and actually put the country into a less financial position to be able to do something.\nThe focus on CO2 is actually a highly unproductive and polarizing approach to addressing the environment.  It has virtually nothing to do with the environment.  It is all about re-engineering society and a power shift from the West to China.  Research who Maurice Strong was (called the farther of climate change).  Take the time to fully understand what occurred in 'Climategate' where UN reports were fudged to appease their 'political masters'.\nA focus on C02 and the environment is just like a focus on vaccines for covid.  The focus to deal with covid should be action to address the level of obesity (over 40% of Americans) and all its associated lifestyle diseases.  That's why people are dying from an otherwise quite mild bug.  Society has become incredibly unhealthy, that is the problem.  Focus on a vaccine, is just power and people wanting to make money. Exactly the same as a focus on CO2 emissions thinking that's addressing the environment.

Or the  Climategate sage and fraudulent 'hockey-stick' of Michael Mann???  To not even know these critical issues, and how they have shaped the current highly politicized process that is todays 'climate science'.   It's impossible to understand any subject without some understanding of how it arrived at its current state, which in the case of climate science is vastly more politics than science.   In fact its the complete opposite of 'science' (the open exchange of ideas, evidence based, and strength of argument).\nTo your question does man contribute to global warming?  You want a simplistic grade 1 elementary school level answer ... yes.  Want a Master University level answer .... yes, but the amount is difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy against the  background of MUCH greater natural variability of the climate.  And what to actually do about it .... That is about 5 books worth of response.  I suggest you inform yourself by listening to people like Bjorn Lomborg, or Judith Curry.

It’s much safer than today’s nuclear fission reactors, in terms of nuclear waste, and can produce more energy than we will every need. And for the moment what we can do is move to electric vehicles, as they produce much less carbon over their life span compared to convention cars, even if the initial carbon output is higher when producing them.
