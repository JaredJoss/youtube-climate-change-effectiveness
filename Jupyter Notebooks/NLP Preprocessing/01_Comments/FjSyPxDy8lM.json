{"cid": "UgzDOCD785zQczLp2kZ4AaABAg", "text": "It would be interesting to know what happened in the Arctic during the 10,800 BCE abrupt climate change. We know there were two ice sheets - smaller Cordilleran and bigger Laurentide on North America. The Laurentide perhaps 3 - 4 km thick at some places. \r\n\r\nThere was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.\r\n\r\nAdjusted quote: \"Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.\"\r\n\r\nIf interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ∼9% of world terrestrial biomass on ∼10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km² in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps CO2 released by burning of ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. \r\n\r\nThere is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?\r\n\r\nOne simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. \r\n\r\nRecent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. \r\n\r\nThe paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w\r\n\r\nImpact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. \r\n\r\nThere are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // \r\n\r\nIt is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible \"string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker–Levy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000 m in diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. An encounter with such a million-km-wide debris cluster would be thousands of times more probable than a collision with a 100-km-wide comet or a 10-km asteroid.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "George Davidson", "channel": "UCtyV7Beit_SWdT2KNr1vfyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx4xXk1jpkfSZ8o717Z5OWTte0w6J1Mh0riw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Look at all the power produced by other then oil means its so small if you stopped using oil today or in 20 years you would dump the world into the dark ages!!

Did you know that a claim for damages has been filed with the city of Los Angeles and the LA County Board of Supervisors after city funded Neighborhood Councils denied write-in candidate(s) equal opportunity to speak at candidate forums?  Did you know that the Los Angeles city clerk election division refuses equal opportunity to write-in candidates to have their video statements posted to the city clerk website? Did you know that the LA County Registrar mailed out over 5 million sample ballots and vote by mail ballots where voters are mislead and told that a list of qualified write-in candidates is not available until Feb. 22 when in reality the list was posted by the LA County Registrar around December 31, 2019? Just a series of efforts by the elite to illegally sway the course of the election. You won't see this in major mainstream newspapers but it is still voter fraud. If someone wanted to early vote for a write-in candidate, they would think that they could not do so until the Feb. 22, the way the system works in favor of the elite. The truth is that as a voter, you can vote TODAY  (as of Feb 3) for qualified write-in candidates and you can do so by mail or drop box;  or at the County Registrar office. So of course neither the LA County Registrar nor secretary of State Padilla has issued a press release on this issue. Neither have they responded to my emails about this.

It was one of the most severe catastrophes in human history. Tens of thousands of people were infected with radioactive substances for a long time, and the land was equally contaminated. Chernobyl became a deserted city overnight.\r\n\r\nInstead of saving lives, the first thing Soviet officials did was to conceal information. The earliest news about the disaster all came from foreign media outlets. Still, the Soviet Union refused to admit that there was nuclear radiation for fear of unrest among the people. No protective masks were distributed, and books about radiation were removed from libraries. All phone calls to Chernobyl were cut off.\r\n\r\nLocal officials moved their families out of Ukraine and quickly evacuated their children while keeping the general public in the dark without any protective measures.\r\n\r\nThe parade in Ukraine went ahead under orders from above. People were told to remove the radiation-contaminated lawn with shovels, without any protective equipment, and were not told why they should do so.\r\n\r\nDoctors were not allowed to write “acute radiation syndrome” on medical reports.

{"cid": "UgzCFZwvy81AFVNVQWB4AaABAg", "text": ") On January 9, Libero, a nationally circulated Italian newspaper, reported the findings of an independent tribunal regarding the state-sanctioned killing of prisoners of conscience for organs in China. The newspaper article also strongly condemned the human rights crisis.\r\n\r\nThe interim judgment by the Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners Of Conscience in China (the China Tribunal) was delivered in London on December 10, 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\nItalian media outlet Libero published an article about the London tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe article stated, “After listening to 30 witnesses for three days, from 8 to 10 December, the Chair of the tribunal, Sir Geoffrey Nice, QC, …... concluded: The Tribunal’s members are all certain – unanimously, and sure beyond reasonable doubt – that in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time involving a very substantial number of victims.\"\r\n\r\nThe final judgment, which is due in spring 2019, promises details and figures. Though it carries no legal authority, it will serve as an evidence-based record that can place pressure on international organizations and raise public awareness.\r\n\r\nLibero told its readers, “The Independent Tribunal is an independent public assembly inspired by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), the world's leading body to deal with the issue. Its constitution was announced in the British Parliament on the initiative of Jim Shannon, a Northern Irish member of the Democratic Unionist Party, president of the Interparliamentary Group for Religious Freedom.”", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "李慧", "channel": "UCetGqso5aGfnvSkeFHiy7CQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR9IEmwJhXXhFOrOlNN2B5elVWBH8y5gSm02YdeOw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I very much hope you find your way back to shore. Because I can tell you have lots of potencial. I watched the whole video and it even made me laugh even though its basically just a video of you rambling. I hope you can find a way to calm yourself down, find inner peace, and come to the realization that your already perfect no matter what you do. Do you have access to cannabis or psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms? Those have always been a moral compass for me and a great tool for finding your way through life. Anywho dude happy sailing.

We adapt.\nEven if everyone in the world suddenly decided to shun technology and return to the horse & buggy or living in caves, it wouldn't make a difference. We don't give mother nature enough credit for the constantly changing earth. We have an extremely arrogant attitude to even begin to think that WE can control nature.\nAs someone else posted earlier, there are many factors that 'science' selectively omits in their research. \nFor example- over the past several years, 'cold vents' are more commonly being accidentally discovered during oceanographic research or communication infrastructure upgrade projects in deep sea locations that emit huge volumes of hydrocarbon rich gasses such as methane and hydrogen sulfide. And the deep oceans are the least explored remaining frontier on this planet. We have no clue as to how many of these vents actually exist. No one even has an estimate  of how many could exist.\nAlso, as it pertains to rising sea levels... the big island of Hawaii, JUST the big island of Hawaii, expands by an average of 42 acres annually. \nHow many volcanic islands are there in the world, along with those that are growing vertically from the ocean floor that continually displace sea water?\nIf you dump enough sand into a glass of water, eventually, it's gonna overflow.\nAgain, factors like these are never brought up in the climate argument. \nThis planet has been through and survived cataclysmic events that dwarf whatever consequence mankind could ever create. It has always bounced back better than before, & the earth will go on by itself just fine for billions of years beyond our own existence until the sun begins to collapse and grow to the point that all the planets in the solar system will be incinerated. \nOn that thought, Have a Nice Day!🙂", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Louis Becker", "channel": "UCZmnT8vc-ynIreZNCiZFfVQ", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTl1SI_czjSkjFL74Z3H0lcpT3_m_fCEZxV0A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In this way science is a political institution de facto, governed by society and beholden to it's political will.\"\nIn addition: \n\"There's also the matter of society's control over how science is conducted. Scientists, the normal humans that they are, are just as susceptible to being swept up by the cultural currents of their society as anyone else.\"\nFurthermore: \n\"When we cast our vote in an election, part of what we are doing is determining what will be prioritized in scientific research. Our elected officials control our money, and therefore control our scientific pursuits.\"\nLastly:\n\"Society decides what kind of knowledge scientists are permitted to obtain and disseminate. The Vatican famously imprisoned Galileo and forced him to recant his scientific assertions that the earth revolves around the sun to avoid being burned at the stake. Under Stalin, the Soviet government supported the science of Lysenko, a pseudoscientist who rejected basic principles in biology, because his theories supported the principles of Marxism.

These Democrat candidates have to learn the lessons of 2016 and they need to be doing what Bernie Sanders is doing- 90 percent of the things they say must express how they are either going to put more money in Americans’ pockets or save us more money.

Unions had to make sacrifices in wage increases and other benefits like child care because healthcare was used as a negotiating tactic. Medicare For All is comprehensive and equal too or better than most union plans. Instead of having to renegotiate their healthcare every time and sacrificing wage increases and other benefits, unions can finally focus on securing wage increases for members. Under Medicare For All, union members have more comprehensive healthcare, that is guaranteed and can't be stripped and used against them when they go on strike. This happened to UAW members when GM took away their healthcare, leaving many members' families helpless. Even under union plans, there are still premiums (which is essentially a private tax), etc. Under Medicare For All, that's all eliminated. Unless you've been living under a rock Medicare For All saves money. \"The analysis, conducted by researchers at Yale University, the University of Florida and the University of Maryland, found that transitioning the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would actually save an estimated $450 billion each year, with the average American family seeing about $2,400 in annual savings. The research, which was published Saturday in the medical journal The Lancet, also found that Medicare for all would prevent about 68,000 unnecessary deaths per year.\r\" - Newsweek  This isn't the only study that shows this.

I think high-speed rail would be a good thing for this country but it can never be built under the corruption that takes place in these government projects. Just look at the SLS. \n\nMike Bloomberg’s is more about supporting other countries than our own. All the Paris agreement did was make other countries rich while tying our hands. Sadly it does nothing for pollution since the biggest polluters are off the hook, India and China for example.\n\nWarren just doesn’t make sense, What’s funny is the private sector has done more to help the environment then government scientists. if you can’t get the raw materials to build your green programs how is that going to work. There goes Warren pulling out the race card. it has nothing to do with the color of your skin but it’s about your pocketbook. Look at Flint Michigan for example heavy pollution and mostly white. You have to remember that much of the waste disposal was done in early years before it was regulated. Yes there are those who illegally dumped but don’t use the race card you’re pandering.\n\nBernie is misinformed, natural gas is cleaner and better for our environment that’s even some of your green programs. When turbines destroy wildlife, solar farms destroy land. \n\nAmy these environmental agreements do not stop the gross polluter’s like China and India. All it does is cost our country money and tie our hands. We do United States is probably the cleanest super power on the market.\nAnybody remember carbon credits, what a joke that was. it turned into a money making scam. And did very little for pollution.\nWarren Yes there is corruption it’s called the Democrats and Rinos. How much did congress get done since they took power. Sure they put out a lot of bills but nothing BiPartisan.\n\nThese are all filled good speeches but intern they have done nothing.

{"cid": "UgxnMcDi1RY2mm-VAKl4AaABAg", "text": "Don’t be fooled by these ignorant politicians. They, for the most part, clearly don’t have very strong grasps on environmental science. We cannot just outlaw fossil fuels and expect society to not fall apart. We must first replace fossil fuels in energy production with reliable green energy such as nuclear power. Look at France, 75% of their electricity is nuclear while solar and wind are only about 2-3%. Forget the PCA, we should fix ourselves before even thinking about telling other countries what to do. We tend to jump ahead with things like electric cars but what good are they if the electricity is from fossil fuel power plants? When it comes to mining, we cannot just stop as we need those resources. Warren talked about “sustainable” mining as if that’s a thing (we mine for things that don’t replenish themselves so it is impossible to be sustainable). Instead, we need to make technological advancements like sodium (a very abundant element) ion batteries so we don’t need to mine for nearly as much lithium (a rare and toxic metal). Maybe focus on phasing out coal and oil before natural gas, which can act as a temporary main source of energy until we can reach mostly green. It seems to me most of these people are exaggerating the current state of global warming and using it as an excuse to implement their socialist policies. If the government was less of a regulation monster, private nuclear power plants could become more abundant. If a candidate truly cared about environmental issues, they’d talk about specific solutions, not regurgitated crap about solar and wind power (two very inefficient and destructive energy sources on a big scale). A big problem we face is the disappearing of the Ogallala Auqifer from us taking more water from it than is being replaced but they aren’t talking about that. Biden said cities are experiencing the worst, maybe thats because they are all run by Democrats? Warren kept referring to “colored communities”, isn’t that a little racist instead of calling them “poor”? Don’t believe these clowns, do your own research on environmental science as many people are ignorant on it. Can you (the reader) explain the actual science behind climate change? Define albedo, global warming potential, ozone (good and bad), CFCs, etc. Please watch some informational videos and documentaries so you can teach climate change deniers the real science rather than calling them idiots. For example, telling someone “the poor ice caps are melting and sea levels are rising” doesn’t prove global warming is human caused. That’s is an affect not proof. That proves nothing because without evidence by the scientific reasoning, you could argue that aliens are shining a laser at the poles. Remember that environmentalism isn’t political, it’s about life, all life. Republicans don’t hate nature, in fact more spend more time in it than Democrats I’m sure, they just don’t like big government and socialism.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "LizardMan 2500", "channel": "UC20obsQLtnzWw1fSSdHfy-A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQjMCmbF9ycOAF1TWX-QalX1a7QVs3vn1bWJjQt=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Educators would ask who was in charge, and in almost every case, there was nobody in charge except the people who were rioting. Soon, the New Left began to get into those institutions and gain control. It was in the education system that the left got its foothold into the nation: first in colleges, then high schools and even elementary schools. The New Left was a powerful political movement that sw​ept through the nation in the 1960s and 1970s. Agitators and educators worked to bring about changes in homosexual rights, abortion, gender roles, drugs and other issues. The movement was closely tied to the “hippie” movement, and it achieved many of its lawless goals. The New Left was almost identical to the Communist Party!

He had technology almost 100 years ago that would benefit not only the U.S but the whole world. His brilliance and intellect was above and beyond anyone. He worked with Thomas Edison for a short while , which did not work out..Edison became so jealous of him , He rejected mostly everything he proposed. Tesla had designed plans for free clean energy that was hidden in the earth's atmosphere. He also had an endless amount of proven technology and devices  that would make todays technology look antiquated. Do you know what the U.S gov't , the electric and oil companies did to him ? They stopped funding his projects and scrapped everything he created. When He died broke  , the Gov't took all his plans , designs and hundreds of files, never to be seen again. Now the politicians  talk about Climate change , the carbon foot print and clean energy ?? Are you kidding me ??   Tesla saw this coming problem and that's why He wanted to do something about it.  the Gov't will NEVER do anything about it  , I don't care what they say. .There is way too much money involved  ( Trillions ) over time and lobbyist funding politicians. Some things never change , right ?  The only time you see Tesla's name today is on back of a car, not just any car. It is the MOST advanced , best engineered, zero emission , fastest car on the road today. A perfect tribute to ONE man...Nicolas Tesla.

There is not anuff space here to go in detail; but on average (All solar cell panels must be replaced ever 1-3 years and at the cost of 30g's or 1000g,s a pop.) Nope not real good ideal and this is on the low end price wise. Like I said I work in the industry. I think steam driven turbines with solar array like Abudabi dose is a good ideal. The solar industry is still in its infancy stage right now. It has to do alot of work to get better. There is another way to heat our houses and keep them cool. In Germany there are clean burning fire places that has low emissions of smoke in the air but Americas are tree huggers so thats out. I can go on and on. We need smart young people investing themselves in science education. For every dollar spent on usless activism could be invest into research grants for low income to have education dedicated to those seeking out earth scinces. This world is driven by money thats that. Everyone wants to be the next actor, Football player, Rockstar, Rapper fame fame. People lie to their selves. No one wants to go hungery who has hungered ask a poor homeless person sometime. He will say hell no I hate being without. Only fools are jealous of the ritch because they say they destroy the world but they want their money to fix a society problem. Population growth impacts the whole world by far than anything. More fule more food more trash more deforestation look at Brazil you can't lay solar panels in a juggle. You have to have line of site. I have lobbied politicians to make pro solar growth bills in California. Even that has not helped. It a way of being honest wiyh our self. San Francisco, Vagas, LA, New York, ect. ect. Uses electricity to lite up every billboard, street, and building 24-7 ever ask youself how much energy drives these lights 365 days of the year? No one ever turns them off and more are added every day. If that is not power wasted well all America should slam a big giant needle of Fentanyl in our arms and sleep the ignorant sleep of truth less. We are not real. Like I said Pie in the sky. Its okay to dream that how we made it to the moon. Unless you beliefss are the earth is flat, autism is caused by inoculation, we faked the moon landing. No matter what I say matters then. But I do think its a great plan but the whole country has to be onboard. Not every state took up the mandated healthcare act. Thanks I hope I made some sense and don't spund out of my mind or I opposed your ideals because of politics. I don't trust any politician to make my world better. We the people have yo want it. That starts with true hard factual education that uses the scientific prosses. Not hopped up we die in 12yrs because I said so.

Just to clarify the chemical reaction of the green house effect is proven and not debatable it's a chemical reaction. Obviously I recognize that that is caused by Increased CO2 emissions. With that said in the past 115 years the global temperatures have only risen 0.85 degrees these are numbers directly from the UN climate report. They acknowledge that temperature change has been happening on a global scale since the ice age and that this is on record and heavily recognized. They blatantly miss inform the public by not sitting this. By their own projections if we followed everyone of their measures like going to net zero emissions, we would still see a temperature rise of 2.7 degrees by 2100 if we continued on current projections the earth would warm 3.2 degrees 0.5 degrees caused by human impact to climate change that's it. Now let me ask you this, is there any difference between the weather 115 years ago and the weather today. Not in the slightest this is all recorded data.

{"cid": "UgywW6d7jA7erP_Hru14AaABAg", "text": "I was listening closely to this debate. Warren does not speak logically about ecology. She says you have to stop all mining and off shore drilling but for the industries that are for her? Who makes this determination? Her reply is illogical. Actually, M. Bloomberg is the only one on the stage that has built a successful business. Americans, socialism is also illogical at this time. Yes, a small amount of controlled socialism is essentially what Canada and the Scandinavia does already and it is hard to rein in.  The reform of the medical system is way above the understanding of anyone on the stage. Medical Care in America can never be like Canada or Norway or whatever country that has a tiny population and is highly taxed. Americans, do not envy Canadian socialized medicine. I have many, many examples of seniors being on wait lists and giving up and going to the States to the best doctors. Bernie keeps making a reference to Canada wrongly. Canada has the population of one state that is California and Canada has an incompetent leader that is mismanaging the country. Canadians have serious issues with a two tiered system already. Bernie is talking without knowing. Do not listen to the obtuse bubble head Jim Carrey that has not lived or relied on anything but his Hollywood fortune and capitalism for decades. Jim Carrey has NO IDEA about working Canadians and the serious issues in Canada today. He won a proverbial lotto ticket with some skill as a stand up comic however Carrey realized expeditiously with the help of the greater Rodney Dangerfield and others that the movies would make him rich. The Hollywood system is raw capitalism. Carrey is a raw capitalist and took the money from it gladly to finance a lifestyle he could only dream about in Ontario. Carrey is lost and irrelevant today. What tomfoolery!  My point is also Carrey is a complete hypocrite. He did witness his father that could not keep a job under the government of the father of the trudeau boy in office now; PE Trudeau (failed socialist) largely shocked the Canadian economy from (1968-83)  that has always been  under transition for millions. PE Trudeau was a socialist lawyer and politician. PE Trudeau was also a trust fund kid.  His son was a failed drama teacher and a trust fund kid that stumbled into federal politics. This is how horrible the choices are in Canada. In fact,  Carrey is from my hometown and I knew his family from afar. My older sibling worked with his dad on a few odd jobs.  I left Canada for the same reasons Jim Carrey did; I did not want to end up like his parents. Canada has a seasonal economy for millions. Canada does not provide very good jobs. Period. Canada celebrates those that talk and write in pretty ways for the Crown and HMQ. This is fact. Americans won a revolution in 1776 to be cut from the British Crown. America is a FREE Republic that has made some errors but largely successful for all now.  Americans have to reform the medical system slowly over generations. A shock to the economy right now could end all improvements in the economy.  Do not try to put in some quick revolution or some Obamacare or Sanders nonsense. Obama was a great talker. Very little aptitude on the action department. Sanders is simply a very confused, contradictory man.  It is a slow process to make the medical system better in the States and keep providing charity hospitals for the desperately poor as you slowly put in reforms to make the system better for all. Do not follow any other country. America needs only an American medical system designed for them only.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Dennis Ritchie", "channel": "UCd_5_wOvOc9V9hqjBF-rGLg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8H0UwzmF92HDPJdaPg5w_KwQP_2FZb3z68yVhZg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The truth of it as always is mostly in the details. For instance what proportion of impacted workers already have skills that place them well to transition easily to the new industries( In the case of the green new deal this is a high ratio because most of the skills used in mining are very important in major infrustructure projects) how much of a hand does the policy take in retraining and finding good new jobs for those whos skills dosnt make that happen automaticallly & what compensation does it give to people who are too close to retirment age to be retrained ect. Where the policy gets those things right (which the green new deal makes major pains to do) most potentially impacted workers end up in better positions or at least are not worse off, and those who are have that impact limitied. Meanwhile net gain of millions of good jobs are created leaving millions of working class people much better off.
