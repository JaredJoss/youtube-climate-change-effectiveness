And i recall that it was all over french news for a couple of days, as they really just could not believe how willfully ignorant these government officials were when it came to climate change and global warming. \nPeople outside of the U.S. were just astonished...         \nI remember when the host played clips from this same event on national t.v., and the main guests; some minister from the french conservative LREM party, and a climate activist from  green EELV party, actually both laughed because they truely thought that it was satire! The host then tried to explain, and the conservative still wasn't having it. He started defending the American conservative movement, by comparing it to the French equivalent, and referencing original conservative principles etc... \nBut then the other guest caught on and said \"-Oh, but the American conservatives are different, their movement is full of religious extremists who embrace 17th century superstitions and reject science... what we're seeing is really happening over there, it's quite unbelievable isn't it? In the 21st century, in the world's leading super power! \"  The conservative minister and the  t.v. host end up agreeing with  the member of the green  party that America was in the process of losing all credibility in the eyes of the world, and that due to a growing overt distain for critical thinking, poor education, and rampant conspiratorial obscurantism, the U.S.A. was no longer in a position to be taken seriously on positions such as climate change, energy development, or progress in the public sector.  \nAt the time  I remember thinking \"That's a bit harsh!\" And telling myself how it's probably just a phase that American politics we're going through... that eventually people would get a grip, and cooler heads would prevail, and America would end up leading the way into the new era of renewable energy and responsible production... \nHow completely and utterly, very, very WRONG was I !?!?!  üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòß \nBarely a decade later, and the U.S.A is a global laughing stock, whilst in the grips of a violent proto-fascist movement, with a ridiculous orange authoritarian wanabe dictator at the helm of the nation, and who defines \"Truth\" as \"whatever makes him feel good about himself at any given moment in time\".......üò®", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "cloud atlas", "channel": "UC8YE4tqQ8phYEzBOx0uovGA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQwVCQvEcqRRa-J4NP-pkZwAdmGEGKpi19EdA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxEHBaTCuqa1zA9eBJ4AaABAg", "text": "Essentially, human pollution consisting of several distinct large and complex gaseous molecules escaping into the upper atmosphere (not the CO2 and other gasses remaining at ground level and used as plant food) but transition into the  upper atmosphere are not to be added to Total Solar Energetic Irradiance results and understood together. The contributions of total solar irradiance (TSI) heating are enormous especially when compared with human pollution contributions and interactions based on face value assessments of subjective observations. The combination of the two are meaningful and significant but not for purposes of this conversation. The human contribution is dwarfed when viewed in this way but not insignificant. \r\nSolar activity should initially be accessed separately over the long term and planet wide in order to fully understand and estimate its impact on its own. Human contributions to Global Warming/Climate Change must be studied separate from and calculated IN ADDITION to Solar Heating.\r\nSecond is human pollution climate forcing observations and assessments compiled over a long period of time and planet wide and must always be understood as a force IN ADDITION TOO total solar irradiance? That is pollution forces and interactions impact our planet and how do these numbers influence TSI? What are the long term effects of one on the other and visa versa? \r\nI do appreciate all of your efforts but I fear you are blinded by the forest and missing the tree, seeing the forest first from every subsequent perspective. Although it is important to include all of variables in any assessment of science phenomena we must be vigilant to fully access each component separate from all others first in order to gain an understanding of the effects of one on the other and visa-versa. Additionally, the effects of ground level gasses have nothing to do with aerial compound and large molecule gasses escaping into the upper atmosphere.\r\nAdditionally in accessing solar energetics electromagnetics and other planetary interactions including reactions another aspect underreported in all S0 videos is to account for outgoing solar energetics. Ben your work in describing total solar irradiance , climate Forcing, weather creation and patterning, wind cell patterning, terrestrial and atmospheric electrical and magnetic patterning including associated phenomena etc. etc. is insightful and appreciated. It might be important to include reflected energy losses including beginning in the upper atmosphere where earths‚Äô magnetosphere diverts accumulating 1200-4500 degree direct and radiated solar heating around and past the earth. As the majority of solar energy is swept away and around/diverted away from earth with it goes a long list of upper atmospheric charged particles, gaseous ions etc. rising and joining with departing solar wind charged particles etc it attaches to through the forces of inductive charging, cohesion and adhesion, electromagnetics, surface tension and the like cyclical activities, thereby pulls at the rising and thinning Earth atmosphere. If in fact the Earth was blanketed with a static energy of any type the effect in this case would then produce an increasingly dense and increasingly warmer atmosphere etc.  \r\nThe effects of complex, large molecule, upper atmosphere pollution gasses and their effects are always additive. Their accumulating in the upper atmosphere (doubling in number every 25 years) absorbing and reflecting direct incoming solar heat and reflecting and absorbing outgoing radiated solar heat are always tabulated/compounded after the effects of Direct total solar irradiance are calculated. Human impact is added on top of TSI or in addition to TSI.\r\nThe NASA video linked below shows several important considerations always critical in scientific observations. Perspective is as ever an important consideration. The video seemingly shows global warming expanding from Earths axial northern pole first and expanding into more temperate climate areas.\r\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-2019-second-warmest-year-on-record", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "I wantAvote", "channel": "UCZ3hfhIz5q8srQwQGYehUcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkqMhT8dI6nKAOTR3BocZpVDUDdxdI6DMfQKRz2w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Only about 10% of Earth's land is covered by ice.\nThat leaves 90% not talked about.\nThe 10% WILL cause sea level to rise without a doubt.\nThe important unanswered question is \"By what level will the water rise?\"\nWe'll lose coast land for sure. \nRichies will have to move inland a mile or so.

Again, big whoop. \nWith some land losses elsewhere on Earth.\nMy concern is, what the Earth will do to counter the CO2 rise. Earth always wins the co2 fight, usually at the cost of species living on it. \nSoon as Earth eliminates the source of the rising co2 (humans), it will once again return to it's resting state. A balance of co2, nitrogen, and oxygen. \nActually, I am unsure what may happen to oxygen levels. If plants survive, it may remain at breathable levels. \n\n(It's NOT what we do.

{"cid": "UghLlM0N5KReWXgCoAEC", "text": "What is so very irritating is that carbon emissions is not the reason it seems hotter.  Now listen, the Ozone is now depleted to the extent that there is not enough of it to diffuse (scatter) the suns rays as they pass through the atmosphere thereby heating the surface in a more direct fashion.  Proofs of this come easy, for one the sun at midday is a very bright xenon white in color as compared to the school bus yellow appearance that it was in the 1970's.  Also one just has to feel the temperature difference on the skin between sun and shade. Materials left outdoors are now breaking down at a much higher rate than they did some 20~40 years ago (same materials, same quality and construction). \n     You see when the suns rays pass through a dense layer of ozone those rays are scattered in all directions, a direct result of this scattering changes the appearance of the sun to a yellow ~ yellow/orange color when viewed at noontime from the ground.\n     There were many experiments done in the 1970's and before to find the most efficient means of reducing the ozone layer above the polar regions. This was done in hopes of melting the ice so that the vast natural resources can be accessed. Unfortunately this ozone layer depletion goal failed to keep the effects localized over the poles as was hoped.   Several of these experiments were done from the skylab space station back in the 70's, several types of aerosols were tested to see in real time how effective they were at dissolving the ozone layer. The skylab experiments are documented and can be found online from a dot gov website, although it takes a lot of digging the documented evidence is there for all to see, It also shows where/who the push for this depletion originates.  So it actually doesn't take much thought to be able to see the big picture of this global warming deception.

If you know what scientific results are expected of you, you are inclined to make sure your future funding is secured by providing the political consensus)\n2. in so called social sciences (like economics) ideology plays an even bigger role... Not just funding is an objective influencing the scientific focus and outcomes of peer-reviewed papers in journals. It will become impossible to even publish in the first place (not just dealing with the consequences of what your scientific findings say about reality). The bias in mainstream peer-reviewed economics is so strong that any effort to bring in some fresh ideas and approaches into the scientific community are nipped in the bud before they even get the chance to be seen (let alone reviewed) by somebody interested in it.\nI see phd students reviewing paper about topics where they do not even know the basics about, let alone possess any specific knowledge, just because their thesis supervisor delegated his/her work. And even if these professors did it themselves.

Essentially they're saying money corrupts, and it's impossible for a scientist to get paid for doing their job without it representing or causing a conflict. Well if money is such a corrupting influence, how about we make it a law that no politician gets any money, ever? After all, nothing they do (mostly standing or sitting in a room) really costs anything, certainly not compared to scientists, who need expensive technical equipment and access to data, field stations and hiring assistants and students. And what costs they do incur, we already subsidise anyway on top of their regular pay, unlike scientists who usually foot their own costs out of their salaries.\n\nConservative US politicians like talking about getting rid of entitlement and people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps; well how about we get rid of their entitlements and perks and anything that could make them complacent or corrupt, and make sure they do their jobs the way they would like us to do ours? The hard way, and for minimal cost. It would be the honest thing to do. And while we're at it, why not hold politicians to the same honesty standards as we do scientists? If a scientist is caught plagiarising or falsifying data even slightly, they get forced to resign. How about when a politician makes a false claim which doesn't appeal to the verified facts, they get sacked?

The proof has actually been around for at least since Svante Arrhenius showed that CO2 will cause global warming over 100 years ago. But it was actually the air force that brought the science to the next level in understanding exactly how the CO2 molecule works. So your Ph.D. friends, do they actually read any of this established science and how we know it to be a fact by now, or are they starting from the assumption that everything discovered up to now can be false, hence we dont need to believe any science.

We just can't move on without accepting that fact.\nScience isn't a simple market where you can label the knowledge you sell as a product to your audience whether it's a scientific committee or others.

See, the House Committee of Science, Space and Technology is still governed by politicians. Politicians will use everything within their power to their advantage and either protect their position or fight for what's likely to be most profitable to them. They understand their audience a little better than those nerds in white coats and will communicate their argument in a language that suits the audience best, and the audience understands the concept of having no product means you're out of business. In this case, if there's no climate change then there's no need for climatologists. It's right in their name after all, right?

There are a lot of things about the presidency that came about because it's what Washington did, and everyone is just following his lead. For example, when the office of President was first created, people were proposing that the holder of the office be addressed as \"your Majesty,\" and Washington was the one that said it sounded too regal, too monarchial. So they came up with \"Mr. President.\" The Bible presidents are sworn in on, is still the one Washington used. And after Washington's second term, pretty much everybody wanted him to take a third term, and he declined. So all the presidents after that decided, if Washington wouldn't take a third term, neither will I.

Personally, being a student pf electrical engineering and computer science, i take great pride in the fact that the scientific community is very pure and noble. Yet i do believe that there are some of us who might get bought, but we choose our representatives due to merit, so they cannot be corrupted. The main difference between science and politics, is that in politics you can argue and come to different conclusions, and in the end rely on a statistical method such as voting, in order to take an action. This means that the truth in politics is not one but many, and they struggle to choose one that better represents their interests (as shown from the financial backers of this politicians). In science on the other hand, the truth is one and that is mathematically and experimentally proven, you cannot go around and deny facts, thus you cannot pay a scientist to lie.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Th B", "channel": "UCCcef3a18BHTzYErLKIufhg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQIgKWIqFbsL24xUIEj7yUj2SlUR3W3ZzAJq3nKlw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes, bacteria or other microorganisms with very short generation spans might survive, but that doesnt mean they couldnt be wiped out, nor does it guarantee the formation of new developed species. Evolution is not so much a process with a drive, but more of a random process. There is no drive in a species that makes it evolve. It is purely based on a large population undergoing random mutations and the more suitable mutations being selected. If all life on earth boild down to one simplistic bacteria, there is no \"drive\" that makes this bacteria mutate more suitable features.

Unfortunately, the anti-global-warming side use this fact by twisting it in their campaign of dis-information. They are counting on most people knowing only a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù bit of science. Yes, it's true, that the ocean would not rise if the ice burgs in it were to melt. But here comes the point that John Stewart could only crudely allude to. Which is that this only applies to the north pole where the ice is already in the ocean. Were he in a position to elaborate, he'd say that the danger lies in what exists at the south pole. There you have a continent about the size of Australia. That continent is completely covered in ice that has the average thickness between two and a half to three miles. Now if that ice melts, it then leaves the land its sitting on and ends up in the ocean, thereby rising the sea levels.\n¬†Now as to how high the sea rises? I've heard reports that range anywhere from 3 to 300 feet. I honestly don't know which is accurate but suffice it to say, that it really does not matter. Even the best case scenario of 3 feet would still be considered catastrophic. Think about it, there are cities around the globe that are highly prone to flooding when hurricanes happen. IE: New Orleans. Other places like Holland, have huge dams to keep the ocean back. Now New Orleans has devices to measure the oceans rise and fall to within a quarter of an inch. If they feel that such a small amount of change is worthy of measuring, imagine what 3 feet would mean to them.\n¬†Approximately eighty to ninety percent of the worlds population live by the worlds oceans I believe. Were the ocean to rise to catastrophic levels, it would not happen in a heart beat but very quickly all the same. As a result, there would be over an extremely short time frame, a mass exodus inland into other cities ill equipped to handle the sudden influx. Mass economic turmoil, food, medical, and housing crises would be the immediate result.

This warming trend has subsided about 6,000 years ago, and sea level has been comparatively stable since the Neolithic. The present interglacial period (the Holocene) has been fairly stable and warm, but the previous one was interrupted by numerous cold spells lasting hundreds of years. If the previous period was more typical than the present one, the period of stable climate, which allowed the Neolithic Revolution and by extension human civilization, may have been possible only because of a highly unusual period of stable temperature.\n\nBased on orbital models, the cooling trend initiated about 6,000 years ago will continue for another 23,000 years. Slight changes in the Earth's orbital parameters might however indicate that, even without any human contribution, there will not be another glacial period for the next 50,000 years. It is possible that the current cooling trend may be interrupted by an interstadial in about 60,000 years, with the next glacial maximum reached only in about 100,000 years.\n\nBased on past estimates for interglacial durations of about 10,000 years, in the 1970s there was some concern that the next glacial period would be imminent. However, slight changes in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit around the Sun suggest a extended interglacial for about 50,000 years. Additionally, human impact is now seen as possibly delaying what would already be an unusually long warm period. Projection of the timeline for the next glacial maximum depend crucially on the amount of CO\n2 in the atmosphere. Models assuming increased CO\n2 levels at 750 parts per million (ppm; current levels are at 407 ppm) have estimated the persistence of the current interglacial period for another 50,000 years.However, more recent studies concluded that due to the amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth's Oceans and atmosphere, that this will prevent the next glacial (ice age), which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more glacial cycles.\n\nThe charts that are peer reviewed and substantiated by 97% of climate and meteorological scientists can be found here.....\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Carbon_History_and_Flux_Rev.png", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Daniel Ramsey", "channel": "UC3yk3AVseR1kHmG-NvWGfUg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZZReIoSPr9woUrOO0W_80psQpVN9HcGYlUsQ0aw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjVI84M2cXktXgCoAEC", "text": "Two points:\n1. There are many who are aware that water does not rise when ice melts. Unfortunately, the anti-global-warming side use this fact by twisting it in their campaign of dis-information. They are counting on most people knowing only a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù bit of science. Yes, it's true, that the ocean would not rise if the ice burgs in it were to melt. But here comes the point that John Stewart could only crudely allude to. Which is that this only applies to the north pole where the ice is already in the ocean. Were he in a position to elaborate, he'd say that the danger lies in what exists at the south pole. There you have a continent about the size of Australia. That continent is completely covered in ice that has the average thickness between two and a half to three miles. Now if that ice melts, it then leaves the land its sitting on and ends up in the ocean, thereby rising the sea levels.\n\tNow as to how high the sea rises? I've heard reports that range anywhere from 3 to 300 feet. I honestly don't know which is accurate but suffice it to say, that it really does not matter. Even the best case scenario of 3 feet would still be considered catastrophic. Think about it, there are cities around the globe that are highly prone to flooding when hurricanes happen. IE: New Orleans. Other places like Holland, have huge dams to keep the ocean back. Now New Orleans has devices to measure the oceans rise and fall to within a quarter of an inch. If they feel that such a small amount of change is worthy of measuring, imagine what 3 feet would mean to them.\n\tApproximately eighty to ninety percent of the worlds population live by the worlds oceans I believe. Were the ocean to rise to catastrophic levels, it would not happen in a heart beat but very quickly all the same. As a result, there would be over an extremely short time frame, a mass exodus inland into other cities ill equipped to handle the sudden influx. Mass economic turmoil, food, medical, and housing crises would be the immediate result. With more pain to follow.\n\n\n2. Even if the south pole did not exist and we only had to concern ourselves with the melting of the north pole there would still be world wide climatic consequences. How? Were that ice to melt it would affect the path of the worlds ocean conveyor. ‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù you might be asking. Well you've no doubt heard of the jet stream. The ocean conveyor is the oceans version of the jet stream. And it is this conveyor that actually determines how the jet stream behaves. The effects of the ice melting are already being felt. As one example, look at tornado alley in the United States. With each passing year the size of it is increasing. It's beginning further south and stretching further north. Wider to the east and west too. Not only that but it's starting earlier in the season and running later too. The number of tornadoes reported has increased as well as there sizes and wind speeds and even how many are touching down at the same time.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "outside the box", "channel": "UCf7NRl7oJqklUT_dDUrobbw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLROB_oh5l0t0XFNHImMDqCsXWKm6dFBVn8sg-yx=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Smog, air pollutants, and potential greenhouse gases ¬†in general are things we really don't want in our atmosphere, and more importantly are often signals of inefficiency.\n\nYeah, that last bit is leading into the POLITICS, that really matter here.¬†How do you get these regulations passed, and yet also allow them to benefit society as a whole rather than be a detriment? If they must be a detriment to industry, how can you get someone like say, China, to also follow these regulations if you do. If you pass them and intentionally handicap yourself, industry won't even bother with you and while you rot away someone else benefits while making all the pollutants they want (right until we all burn they bathe in money instead of water). See THESE are just a few of the political question most republicans, democrats, and all these \"scientists\" (generic term for someone you must listen to these days) refuse ot answer or don't get any attention for their answers.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "MrLittlelawyer", "channel": "UCJA2xTOLH9_3OsSWhsH-lnA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/7eZW7SkD7zW4NbYunyr6PihCdJO5myTg0ER1oCnwFJ_yIOhHlGmnj_4YgaA-nMbVmX7r7k6zkQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And what decreased them? The fact is CO2 levels lags behind temperatures - sometimes, and sometimes no relation at all.¬†\n\nI already answered this, but again: the coming and going of glacial periods is the result of Milankovitch cycles. Imagine the Earth is in an ice age. Then changes in the Earth's orbit will cause the Earth to receive more solar radiation, so the Earth will get warmer. Warmer oceans can't dissolve as much CO2 as colder oceans, so this warming will cause oceans to release CO2. Because of the greenhouse effect, this increase in atmospheric CO2 will cause more warming, which results in more outgassing of CO2. It's called a positive feedback.\nAt one point the¬†Milankovitch cycles will result in less solar radiation and the Earth will cool, this cooling causes the oceans to absorb more CO2 and the whole process is reversed.\nThe Holocene maximum is just the maximum temperature during this interglacial.

Many people don't do critical thinking, and they selectively see things that confirm their existing conclusions. So it is really hard to tell those people what we found in lab. And the academia can be way more competitive than the industry, so we really don't have lots of time and energy for conversations going nowhere... But if someone is willing to see things logically, we are very happy to share and don't mind the time at all.\nPlus our publications have no juicy eyeball-grabing headlines, so people get bored quickly. (This one is on us. Researchers need to balance story-telling and scientific rigorousness.)\n\n\nWhat worries me also is while middle-school education is watered down, college education is turning into vocational education. People laugh at the bleak job market for liberal arts majors, while good liberal arts education provides the broad range of knowledge and fundamental reasoning skills for a intellectually free person. As an STEM major, some of my peers' lack of knowledge outside their immediate field is appalling, which of course prevents them from promoting their results to a boarder audience. We get Bachelor's on science, but do we really know where science comes from, how the methodology evolves, and what its limits are? Or is the diploma merely a ticket to big tech companies? Even as we get the Doctor of Philosophy degree, how many of us know about natural philosophy, the ultimate pursuit of understanding nature and bettering human life? Or are we just a bunch of nerds solving crazily complex equations?\n\nTo be fair, it has been quite easy to talk with STEM majors outside my field and liberal arts folks. They are trained in reasoning after all.

Let me try to give you a broad overview - which I hope you will listen to. \n\nThere are these gases which are \"green house gases\" - i.e. their molecules help retain the heat within our atmosphere. It is a good thing - because otherwise we would be a colder place - inhospitable for life. But since the industrial revolution, these gases have been increasing in concentration in the atmosphere - which affects the global temperatures. When the temperatures rise sufficiently, they melt the permanent ice-formations on the northern and southern poles of the earth - which means extra water in the ocean - which will flood the coastlines of all continents. That means most of the earth's best cities will be affected by it. Maldives - a whole country - might become submerged if this goes on. \n\nThis was a broad outline, now if you truly want to know more, you have to do it by yourself.

{"cid": "Ugg1mQ9mT7lYI3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-MzZh73SUpWpMG5u", "text": "¬†@Edward Dongres¬† We know that global warming is happening based off of changes in weather patterns and overall climate changes, including temperature, humidity, etc. from across the world that we have observed and recorded over time.\n\n\nThe reason why it is considered to be an issue that we need to address, is that within the next 100 years, if we refuse to look for a proper solution to at least curb the rate of change, will cause these negative consequences for humanity: exposure to the sun and the elements will be very inhospitable for humans to live comfortably; many plants and animals (which we need to use as nourishment among other things) will be unable to adapt quickly enough to survive, which will drastically reduce the available resources to maintain food supplies for the general public; the oceans will rise which will cause a sizable portion of our overall land mass to be uninhabitable as it will be underwater; drastic changes in weather patterns (which is already happening at an alarming rate) which will cause frequent natural disasters to occur; air will become more difficult for us to breath (you could probably soldier through it if you didn't have any bad habits in life, though). There are more, but those are the bigger ones.\n\n\nAs far as anecdotal evidence for the contrarian opinion, such as record low temperatures or places freezing over when they haven't in a very long time, that is actually apart of global warming. All you have to do is understand how weather works, which I can give a brief summary here for you: all of our weather is based on two key factors: air pressure and humidity, which is to say, how much air is in a given area compared to surrounding areas and the amount of moisture that is in the air. Heat (say, from global warming) has a direct effect on both. Weather patterns occur based off of air movement and the density of water in the atmosphere.\n\n\nI hope you learned this in grade school, but in case you didn't or you have forgotten I can remind you: rain comes from the \"Water Cycle\", evaporation -> condensation -> precipitation. Sound familiar? Water evaporates when there is enough HEAT to warm the water from its liquid form into its gaseous form. It then floats into the air because the water molecules are lighter than the air around it, and it will continue to rise upwards until condesation occurs. Condensation is when water molecules group together and slowly begin to form back into a liquid form. This occurs because as the water molecules travel upwards, they move high into the atmosphere where it becomes colder and colder due to less surrounding atmosphere.\n\n\nOk, quick side note: heat causes molecules to become \"excited\" which causes them to vibrate faster, which causes them to move away from other molecules; cold, or the absence of heat, obviously has the opposite effect: molecules slow down in their frequencies, which makes it easier for them to stay close to one another.\n\n\nOk, back to the water cycle: so, since it is becoming colder as the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, its molecules slow down and start grouping together more easily. This is condensation. And when they finally group together enough, they reform into a liquid. Now, I am going to assume that I don't have to explain or prove gravity to you or the fact that liquid water weighs more than air... so, assuming you know at least that much, you should have an understanding of how precipitation works. The molecules condense and their density is greater than that of the air around them, and gravity then pulls the liquid water down as precipitation. I know, I explained it anyways. But I feel like I have to be extra sure with people such as yourself. Now, I have explained in depth how precipitation works, and how heat OBVIOUSLY not only affects it, but is quite literally the driving force of it; so we can move onto air pressure.¬†\n\n\nSo, the other weather phenomenon that you notice besides precipitation is the wind. Wind is when air moves from one place to another. So, how does that happen? When there are differences in air pressure (the amount of air within a given space) between two locations, they naturally want to even out. To witness this phenomenon, all you have to do is check your tire pressure. Tires have air in them, and they require a lot more air per square inch (PSI) which is literally the measurement for air pressure. When you check your air pressure, you are more than likely using a simple tool that you place on the tire's valve that makes a small stick pop out that has various numbers written on it. When this occurs, it is due to a high air density (more air in a given area) rushing out of the tire to even out the air density outside the tire. How much force is exerted when this occurs gives you a rather accurate sign of how much air pressure you currently have in your tire, because the more air that is in the tire, the more air will try to rush out to even out with the lower air density outside of your tire.\n\n\nOK, almost done with the lesson here: heat has a similar effect on air molecules as it does on water; which is to say, it causes them to become excited and expand by placing more distance between the molecules. So, when air is heated, you cause changes in air pressure, which causes changes in weather patterns, more specifically, you are causing more wind which leads to more storms such as hurricanes and tornadoes. When the overall temperature of the planet goes up, the differences in temperatures in different areas may remain relative to each other (i.e. Canada will still be colder than the U.S.) but they are still increasing in temperature relative to their previous norms (i.e. Canada is warmer in general than it was previously).\n\n\nNow, this overall warming does not prevent or negate cold weather at all. In fact, it causes more extremes to occur during seasonal changes (more wind & more precipitation). Wind chill causes the effective temperature to be less than what it is. If you have more wind (due to more changes in weather pressure due to more changes in global temperatures) then you have more wind chill. Same with precipitation. More heat causes the cycle to occur with greater frequency because water is evaporating at more constant rate\n\n\nNOW, if you wish to have a discussion, debate, argument, or whatever on whether or not humans are contributing to global warming and by what amount, that is fine. Have that discussion, hold a debate, make your argument. BUT, the evidence that global warming is in fact occurring is so overwhelming and so obvious to anyone who understands grade school environmental science, that this FACT is not up for discussion.\n\n\nThere IS NO debate.\n\n\nYou have no argument.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "zombies8cody", "channel": "UCPrgu-uaCqzpSaO6KeXDuSg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ-eXFYWJYERi1puEEKyCea-W0OHNWkICDEVA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They actually have huge environmental impacts (spills, strip mining, earthquakes) without global warming, but that's not the point. They stand to benefit if climate change is all-natural.\n\nIn the clip, Jon Stewart points out the top 3 campaign donors to one of the congressmen on the committee: Murray Energy, Koch Enterprises, and Peabody Energy. All three work with fossil fuels, all three are better off if climate change is all natural. Of course, just because someone stands to benefit from something doesn't mean they made it up, but Stewart points out something else. \"If scientists could be bought, they'd be making it rain in nerd town\". Or, more professionally, if most scientists were corrupt enough to take money for biased papers, these companies would have bought them (they are all very politically active). If you think that companies wouldn't mess with science, remember that tobacco companies paid for research saying that smoking is healthy.\n\nI'd reckon the Koch brothers alone could out-bid the green energy sector, considering how much more energy we derive from fossil fuels than all renewable resources combined. So, any scientists corrupt enough to exchange biased papers for money would probably flip to the all natural camp. HOWEVER, we see that a vast majority of scientists have not flipped. Either the green energy sector is vastly out-bidding the biggest conservative donors at a rate of 99:1 OR the scientists releasing papers that support the claim that climate change is man-made are not corrupt. \n\nIn fact, the non-corrupt scientists still have a huge incentive to overturn man-made climate change. Scientists, like anyone else, love fame. The great scientists in history all got there by making a new claim. Darwin figured out natural selection, Newton figured out motion, Einstein overturned Newtonian motion. All of these guys are famous, they went against the science of the time but survived the scientific rigor. If a scientist finds definitive proof that humans don't cause climate change, and all the other scientists accept their findings, they will become famous. Therefore, scientists have incentive to disprove man made climate change. Climate change or no, there are still plenty of research grants for studying atmospheric temperatures, so saying that they perpetuate a theory just to get grants is disingenuous. \n\nThe corporate money suggests that, if scientists are corrupt, they'd sway towards all natural. They do not. Scientists have a vested interest in proving established ideas wrong, yet the community hasn't accepted any of all natural hypotheses (remember, the scientific community accepted Einstein and Darwin relatively quickly). I conclude that there is no conspiracy to say climate change is man made rather than natural or not happening at all. If there is no conspiracy, the majority of scientists are most likely correct: the climate is changing and it's mostly our fault. \n\nSo what of the scientists who claim it's all natural? Some may be bought by fossil fuel companies, but I assume some are also unbiased. Climate data is finicky and even rigorous testing can often yield definite outliers. The slim minority of climate-change-skeptical scientists may have mostly this outlier data. However, since the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is our fault, by the rules of scientific research, that's the best we know about our climate. We cannot base policy on scientific theory alone (the closest thing to a fact that anything can get to in science) because very few things reach that status. If we base our policy on \"there's a slight chance this isn't true\" we can't use science for anything. We do the best we can with what we have. Therefore, if we still hold to the Enlightened era ideals we were founded on, we should enact policy to curb climate change until the climate science community reverses its consensus.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "52flyingbicycles", "channel": "UCvqOjBZd8_sNuPWipfc6Org", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS67-KGX_kIFAWIIU4l5ZJAb00K9adacXR5UrWCWg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugg1mQ9mT7lYI3gCoAEC.7-H0Z7-MzZh8e45lnCqpLV", "text": "Edward Dongres Ok i stopped reading this after a while and im not sure whether you finally got your answer or not and im also not sure whether u still will see this or not but i cant just ignore this. Global warming means that the world is getting hotter on average. But that can cause various effects on the climate. And these are summed up by the word climate change. That means the global warming, which again means the earth is getting hotter on average not everywhere, can cause a hotter climate in some areas and a colder one in others. And you are right that the real problem will be the next cold period. When the north pole ice melts the new colder ice water will flow into the golf and cause it to stop. The warm water of southern regions cant reach europe and the northern usa anymore and it will get way colder there. So you are on the same point as we when u say that its getting colder in some areas and that the next ice period will harm us most. But u dont seem to accept the fact that its caused by the global warming. First of all there is evidence that the ice is melting at the north pole.  \nSubmarines of the us navy can scan the thickness of ice too see where they can surface. They released the results of there scans and it turned out that there were way more areas where they could surface than centuries before. Also there are satellite pictures that show how big glaciers that have been around for thousands of years now are melting. Also there is a logical explanation for that. The green house effect is proven and could be reconstructed in a lab. And there is much evidence that the global warming is happening (which where already listed by others) and that its not a natural effect. Like some others already pointed out. Natural effects occur slowly and over hundreds or thousands of years not in such short time periods. Right now we can witness a rising of the average temperature in decades way too fast for natural event and that coincidentally at the same time in that we produce more CO2 and methan than ever, which again could be proven to cause the green house effect. So in conclusion we have a logical explanation and much evidence (this were just a few examples) that are supporting  the global warming theory. While on the other hand u have nothing but claims. No one denies that its getting colder in some areas what means that every evidence u gave us that proved its getting colder isnt a con argument against global warming but in fact supports it. The only thing that you have against the global warming theory is that u think its a natural event. But that is just a claim and very improbable because like i said its happening way too fast it would be the fastest ice period ever. Also it such a coincidence because we know that we re producing co2 more than ever and we also have logical explanations for it. Please if u want to know more educate urself.

But by pumping as much CO2 in the air as we are doing now (being higher then it has ever been since the last 500.000 years) we are actually likely postponing the coming ice age and we are warming up the earth. This is not necessarily \"bad\" for the earth, the consquences of warming in such a short time span can have some effects that can be harmful to us though.\n\nCO2 is a greenhouse gas, we have been pumping it into the air most vigorously the last couple of decades and thereby, logically, heating up the planet. This is absolutely an undisputed fact, no matter what you may think of it. The consequences of this might be more difficult to investigate.\n\nBut here is the kicker for you. EVEN if you deny CO2 being harmful or climate change occuring, the resources we are using are non-renewable and will be depleted in the not so distant future.

And the Middle East has been ethnic mash up for thousands of years. It is where Europe, Asia, and Africa have come together to exchange ideas, cuisines, trade goods, etc. long before America was even an idea.\n¬†¬† if you ventured outside your small narrow minded world you would see people of different ethnicities and backgrounds are interacting everyday. Your idea of white genocide is ridiculous. If you could track your genetic makeup over the last 10,000 years you would see how your ethnicity is constantly in a state of change. Did you know the term \"white race\" has only been around for couple hundred years? Did you know, Germans, Dutch, Greeks, Irish were considered nonwhite at times? Or that less than 100yrs ago Mexicans and Japanese were considered white?\nFeel stupid now?

K.\n\n\"No white schools, neighborhoods or cities can be tolerated; anything \"white\" is viewed as suspicious - and must be \"diversified\".\"\n\nYou're being a racist to yourself. Not all white people are the same. To just group the English, French, Spanish, Italian, Swiss, German, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Austrian, Polish, and Hungarian (and many more) people together in one big bundle called \"white people\" and being malignantly ignorant of the fact that they are very different as a people, have very different belief systems and a very different and distinct culture is to commit racism against those of the lighter persuasion.\n\n\"C'mon, name JUST ONE asian, m eastern, or african country that-¬†\n\n-is flooded with mass foreign immigration & govt forced / subsidized integration (aka so called \"diversity\")\n-is propagandized (commercials, sitcoms, movies) to \"intermarry & become a blended humanity & pretty mocha color\"\"\n\nWell, for starters, the Middle East is in Asia, so there's that.\n\nPeople are migrating to majority white nations because they are opening their doors to immigrants whose countries white people have indirectly destroyed. Whether their situation was caused by the Treaty of Versailles, careless and negligent redrawings of the continent of Africa (which has led to the grouping of different sects of Africans who historially have never liked each other, causing general disconent and violence in the region), or full-scale military invasions on their soil, people are fleeing their homelands and going to countries that are predominantely white to restart their lives.\n\n\n\"If this so called \"diversity\" BS is such a \"strength\" - why must it be FORCED - but ONLY in white countries?\n\nSo called \"diversity\" is in reality a code word for white genocide\"\n\nI think you might be really stupid. Apart from that, hundreds of thousands of Americans go to Mexico all the time, and they get upset because nobody in Mexico speaks English, and there are no signs in English in Mexico. There's also the fact that whites have, for hundreds of years, visited other countries and attempted to convert them to their religion, and when they didnt, those who refused the religion of the occident were brutally persecuted and very commonly killed for their resistance.\n\n\nYou're an effective moron spreading some KKK nonsense on Youtube.

TIME magazine hyped a SINGLE study that suggested that particulate pollution was causing cooling (which it was, by blocking solar radiation).

The theory goes back nearly a century, and by the 1950s it was considered the most likely scenario, but we did not have the evidence to have confidence in that prediction. We now do.\n\nTIME Magazine is not a good source for science.\n\nThe predictions about oil were also correct, because they were based on known reserves at the time and estimated rates of consumption. None of them claimed that we would not find new sources of oil - simply that it is a big risk to take - gambling the entire world's energy economy on oil we had not found. Had we not found large new reserves, we would basically be out of oil. Again - read what the scientists ACTUALLY said!\n\nAs for the \"hiatus\" - there is none. There was one anomalous El Nino year (1998) which was MUCH hotter than previous years. But every year after fell back into the pattern we had been seeing - '99 hotter than any year except '98, 2000 hotter than 99, and so on until we finally topped 1998 in 2014.\n\nTo call one exceptionally hot year followed by years that were consistently hotter than all the years before that one a hiatus is like getting a 90 degree day in March in Michigan, and concluding that summer is not coming because it's been cooler every day since that one.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Pat Doyle", "channel": "UCTWInaragf2dDBqKxPcd1NQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBgeUrUNQ0-d0OojWoQ2rwDSG1PAEuNxn58VjV=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjmkfDxtGtgLHgCoAEC", "text": "Maybe Jon Stewart should educate himself about some things.\n\nThe IPCC (where almost all \"climate research\" comes from) is not a research organization, but a government organization primarily pushing government interests. And sadly, scientists have to conform to the opinion of whoever fund the research (which is mostly government) and also need to conform to the general consensus to get their work published. Remember that it was general consensus that the earth was flat and saying otherwise could get you killed.\n\n\"Global climate change is an accepted scientific phenomenon\". But even scientists publishing for the IPCC don't agree on the amount of human effects down to a scale of no measurable effect at all.\n\nWe are in an ice age. Lets repeat that. We are living in an ice age, which is defined by the fact that we have permanent ice on the poles. The current ice age is coming to an end at a time scale of thousands of years. Ice ages existed in long cycles all through earth history without any human interference. The human effect via CO2 on global temperature is not proven at all. CO2 has been 5 times higher than now throughout large parts of history with flourishing plant and animal life. If CO2 would be half of what it is now, plants would STARVE to death.\n\nEvery single climate model by the IPCC fails to predict climate. They keep on changing the models including highly controversial and totally unproven factors and are still unable to make predictions which come even close to measurements. The scientific method can only lead to the conclusion that the models are wrong. So any conclusion made with these models is unproven at best.\n\nThen on the topic of ice. When ice is swimming in water and melting, the effect on the water level is zero. The water even shrinks when the ice water is warming up (towards 4 degree Celsius). All of the north pole ice is swimming. A considerable amount of the south pole ice is swimming. How much glaciers on land are there compared to the polar ice? If the atmosphere is warming, it can hold MORE water. So again, warmer temperature does not automatically lead to much higher sea levels. And even if it does, so what? Who cares about Holland (sorry when you live there, but its not the end of civilization).\n\nAlso, more than half of the ice on the north pole is melting and regrowing on a yearly cycle (not exactly yearly as it it not due to seasons but pacific and atlantic streams). So if the polar ice melting would be a catastrophe, then we would have a catastrope every year or so already.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "LordMardur", "channel": "UCKHkYvUWlHH8uW6dKKFmz_g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTo33Gn_2A7noHk666NFJr6JjiuBUS-smfsfQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

With Propaganda 101, the first step is to win over the complete trust of the people you mean to con. That's pretty easy to do to young children, if you get them from an early age. It's the same thing the tobacco companies used to do. Young children turn into adults, and for them, questioning scientists is unquestionable. \"Why would they lie?\" \"What would they have to gain?\" That's what you're led to believe. The answer is no different than the one I'd give to someone that doesn't believe the church is scamming them. It's their living. Without it, they're out on the street. They both use the same fears. One says climate change will destroy the Earth, the other says you will go to hell eternally for not following the rules of the church. Can any of this be immediately proven? No, and that's why the scam works so beautifully! Now, here is my last point, what was the origin of modern day universities today? Religious monasteries!

Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and water vapour because fossil fuels contain hydrocarbons(compounds containing hydrogen and carbon).

While it is natural to have a fluctuation in carbon dioxide levels and to have greenhouses gases in general, rate of release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is very much greater than rate of absorption of carbon dioxide by carbon sinks such as forests and oceans, causing GLOBAL warming(because of enhanced greenhouse effect). In fact, global temperature has risen over 2 degrees Celsius greater than that before 1850.

The point is, we are fine right now, but both very fundamental science as well as recent statistical research concludes that the climate is indeed steadily getting warmer, with natural flunctuations since the earth is a chaotic system. No one is saying this is 100 %. Science is never 100 %, possibly math, but we're still dealing with extremely high probabilities. What people are worried about is the acceleration of climate change which will lead to a far more dramatic change, therefore it's preferable we start living slightly more ecologically now, instead of thinking about it when not only 50 % of the species out there but something like 90 % have gone extinct, and we're facing an ecological, economical and global disaster. Alarmists can make it sound like it's going to happen today, which is not the case, but that doesn't mean that your winter disproves a global, well-researched trend, nor that there wouldn't be any drastic ecological catastrophes already taking place.¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Sebruz", "channel": "UCb_5nwTxrWZBNBaE6w3p3MA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSk8fhWa0OIriDJEc0RDLDxDgPlfUoCQmr96Sva=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Whatever belief systems people have is highly cultural, even though there will always be people who seldom question or critically examine that which they have an open mind towards. I'm just curious how proving WW2 or ebola is possibly when we take this to a philosophical level, questioning not only the scientific method, authorities and sources of information, but also the technology. Ebola is spiraling out of control in media, it's far more sheeple-propaganda-scaretactics than climate change, and there is no way for us to travel back in time as of now, we are simply taking the word of history books, elders and tradition as truth. These may be easier-to-explain examples, or to \"prove\", but there's tons of stuff which relies on the exact same research and methods that brought us whatever we know about climate change, phenomenon that no one questions, yet they are even harder to perceive.¬†\n\nI'm not saying climate change has to be real because media and climate experts say so. As a matter of fact, tons of politicians, energy/oil companies and reporters deny climate change as a whole, and they have the same senses as scientists so why would their worldview be more biased? I too live in a country where we are literally freezing our asses off atm, yet still the theory of climate change makes perfect, rational sense to me, because 1. I have experimented with greenhouse gases, 2. I've witnessed ecosystems fall, 3. I've read research on both sides, pro-and against climate change, and the only uncertainty seems to be whether or not we are actually the primary cause, even though the latest IPCC put a lot of weight on issuing that (even the researchers speaking up for oil companies and scientists famous for denying climate change say that global warming is a thing, but humans aren't causing all of it) 4. As I said, global warming isn't a catastrophe, but a prophecy. Right now = fine, somewhat normal, cold winters, no super extreme conditions that can be directly correlated to climate change even on a glboal level, melting glaciers and arctic ice yes but still it's nothing stunning... that's the whole problem. If it was doomsday, people would have no problem seeing it in their backyards without being researchers and scientists themselves, people would have no problem reacting to the physical threat (as with your comparison to terrorism or something which is easy for all to see as a threat)... but that's not the case. It's progressing extremely slowly for a single human being, and insanely fast for a geographical cycle, which isn't one bit natural. Neither me, or you, can sense it, because it's not that out of control yet, but it will be after hitting tipping points if we actually aren't going to do anything about it. This generation will deny/procrastinate it, the next may get worried, 5 generations later they will suffer.¬†\n\nEven with all this, it's possible it's just a myth, we don't know. That's the thing, the world is too big for us to be all over the place, or see patterns in weather/climateconditions and keep track of em in our head and thus prove climate change right/wrong. I too am skeptical about this whole thing, but at least for now I have enough basic science + research background to consider this theory highly logical and probabilities high, at least when opposed with somewhat vague \"evidence\", even if you want to call it common sense.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Sebruz", "channel": "UCb_5nwTxrWZBNBaE6w3p3MA", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSk8fhWa0OIriDJEc0RDLDxDgPlfUoCQmr96Sva=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The same people who are researching climate change are well aware that the polar ice caps on Antarctica are getting bigger, it's empirism, it's science, and it's logical if you knew the least about how the world as a global system works. In the north we are seeing the opposite trend, and several glaciers that have been permafrost for hundreds of years have already melted, which could be a coincidence, of course, but there are very few glaciers actually expanding, besides Antarctica. And here we go with the sheep again... questioning climate change is good, and the mainstream science sure, but preferably one would look it up, read it, understand it, and THEN question it with either rational arguments or empirical research which shows otherwise, like a true skeptic... but quite honestly, your own eyes are fallible, and what you can perceive of the global world is so limited that simply because you aren't feeling threatened by climate change isn't a strong enough argument to disprove the theory as a whole.\n\nNaturally, you have the right to that belief and to stating your opinion (and preferably with some common sense and respect, without being called an idiot for thinking otherwise as you pointed out, as certain renowned scientists and free thinkers have been called idiots or even killed for thinking differently in the past, which you also pointed out at least indirectly), but with this vauge arguments this discussion/debate isn't really going anywhere and you're not going to change anyone's view. You might also want to quesitons these reports claiming glaciers are growing bigger, if you claim to be extremely-antisheepish. Honestly, the whole debate is sheepy, only of the other color. Only the skeptics remain whatever a sheep isn't, and with skeptic I mean skeptic, not denialist, not alarmist, but neutral, objective and rational. You also laugh at Raj for naively thinking scientists are under some kind of oath or incapable of lying. I see far better reasons for politicians, media, entrepeneurs, companies, all of those to deny climate change, as I see reasons for them to agree with it. Now, this is a global phenomenon, and there are scientists all over the world who (despite this globalized world) have done independent research, and they have come to more or less the same conclusions. Scientists aren't paid well, unless they are public figures too, and many aspire to become scientists because of their genuine interest in the subject, not to get a job, not to become rich or famous, but to learn more about the world. There will be ones who succumb to corruption if someone offered them a lof of money for right out lying, but whatever they report is also peer review and reviewed by other scientists, and criticizable and examinable by all of em, and to say every scientists in the world is corrupt is beyond paranoia, it's far from realism and as it's possible, it's skeptically speaking highly unlikely that such a conspiracy has existed for tens of years.¬†\n\nAs for your temperature estimates, just because a pole is melting doesn't mean it's molten, and just because the world's climate is changing doesn't mean it has changed. We are still in the early stages or this accelerating trend, and the world is a chaotic system, only the future will tell if the projections and predictions and models will correlate with the \"truth\", and to which degree. At the moment we can only speak of probabilities, and of statistical significance. You have also spoken of reports and about similiar trends in history like the extreme weather which was mentioned, amongst other things, but without any clear reference to a certain article/research/point in history. For avoiding being a sheep, it's good to question those too, and if, despite being the questioning type, using them to support one's own arguments, it's preferable to link them as well, for more credibility.\n\nAnyway, these are youtube comments. They will seldom lead to or account for much. And it's full freedom of speech and trolling, without having to follow any set of rules or prove anything by any methods. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's frustrating. Sometimes one wants to make a change, get one's own opinion heard, but there are people doing it in real life at this very moment with full power, so we can all relax and leave this at discussion, unless one is truly engaged with this issue. As such, I think we can keep the discussion casual and leave death threats and judgement of other's intellect where they belong: in the US Congress. lol jk, but still, no need for that.\n\nRemember this is but reflection and speculation until we reach the future.

First of all, saying all climatologists are ignorant, lying, corrupted, don't know their field, greedy, incompetent or anything else is grotesque generalization and won't really have any significance as an argument in this discussion. Secondly, this is a global phenomenon, studied worldwide, not a US-only conspiracy of democrats looking to re-distribute the economical resources. Where I live, scientists, namely researchers, get shit salaries and are well aware of that as they are making their career-choice during studying. It's a sacrifice, to study what they are curious/interested in, they consciously give up on living a luxurious life, if anything, they can get lucky and become famous or perhaps win a nobel prize, but that's it, their salary is still low and far lower than our High School teachers, who have to study a minimum of 6 years to become one (ofc researchers have to study far longer, another con).\n\nAnother thing is that it's fairly well known that our universities are incapable of hiring all of these experts, resulting in people who have studied for over a decade to end up unemployed. This is not something they learn after they graduate, this is something people know in High School. That + the fact that everything is peer reviewed says, according to my logics at least, that they are more likely to know what they're talking about, more devoted and knowledgeable in their field and less prone to have set out to exploit/fool/gain on others than the vast majority of people, especially big companies that exist solely for financial gain and are going to lose a lot more than any scientist could ever dream of owning (at least here) if we abandon coal and oil. It doesn't require a book of any sorts to conclude that if there is a conspiracy somewhere, it's far more likely to have been started by huge companies with tons of resources, rather than a global science community working and concluding the same things independent of each other. Oh, and I'm quite sure these huge companies have a lot more people employed than there are climatologists in the world.¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Sebruz", "channel": "UCb_5nwTxrWZBNBaE6w3p3MA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSk8fhWa0OIriDJEc0RDLDxDgPlfUoCQmr96Sva=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also, considering that your only argument was that you have been to college and met people who aren't very open to critique to their worldview = drawing paralell that all scientists ever are lying assholes... that's pretty rough generalization, and scientists aren't just \"educated\" people, academics often let it get to their head but researchers, in my experience, are less arrogant or more like even giving a damn about social position or how they're viewed, especially senior ones I've met. But yeah, saying most scientists are liars just becuase of that sounds rather pseudo-scientific to me. And as I've said a lot of time, it's good that you question them, but your arguments aren't really based on anything else but personal experience (it's cold where you live, use your eyes don't read books, scientists are scumbags and feed you horseshit) which doesn't really suffice to convince me that a global phenomenon I've studied, found evidence for and that rationally makes perfect sense even if extrapolating from basic science isn't happening. You may be right, it may not be happening at all, for all I know there could be some conspiracy between green-product manufacturers and scientists or maybe they're just otherwised incompetent in what they claim to be experts of, I don't know.

However, for both sides of this generally very polarized discussion, there are no openminded people, only \"not sheeple\" questioning and criticizing the opposite side but never their own. Neutrality and objectiveness, which IS SCIENCE (therefore, without having researched this personally it's reasonable to go with what science is saying, because in an ideal world, this is the method and principle) is often nowhere to be seen in these discussions, nor have I seen any legit arguments or references so far (maybe at the start of the chain, was awfully long ago lol)... Skepticality comes with philosophy, and most skeptics (note; not denialists, skeptics), also considered among the most intelligent people out there, listening to the rationality of their own mind, questioning all and then concluding based on empirical evidence and own thinking... more or less all of them agree with Climate Change being a phenomenon taking place, and you will need some rather hardcore arguments or reasoning to convince these thinkers otherwise.\n\nBut yeah, nothing is certain in this world, even science is always about uncertainty and probabilities, significance, therefore it's not very fair to instantly ¬†judge the opposing side without actually arguing against them, listening, and if needed admitting they have nothing to say to disprove X or Y or even reaching some kind of compromise. One can't be a free thinker (and therefore independent of these authorities interneti speaks of, \"brainwashed\", ironically not questioning his own side or even senses, bubble, worldview at all... not \"brainwashed\" to internalize and conditioned to believe it all, but having rebuilt one's own worldview) without considering opposing views as a possible truth, but concluding that one is far more rational or likely, and therefore, while aware it may not be an absolute truth, have that as a base for one's worldview.\n\nBut common sense also says that the people publically trying to deny climate change have a lot to win by doing so, and conspiracy-theories are the main tools of a denialist, not a skeptic. Also, one can find proof for anything by googling: just because it's there, doesn't mean it's true. And for real, even if this was uncertain, if it's a question between money and the future of life... absurd, how people can be so obsessed with material goods, luxury, comfort, money, consuming, 3rd party recognition... if there's something stopping action and development, it's the socionormative view on success, which almost no one seems to question, and sorry to say but the US is completely brainwashed by this right from birth, by parents, society, media, school, everything. Individualism is getting out of control... but a rekt planet may be exactly what's needed to snap people out of it, a common threat to end greed, bring unity and peace... haha, as if, it's not even pessimism to assume humanity won't change, people will try to see opportunities to exploit the situation, and greed kicks in again.

{"cid": "UghNuiaj80suxHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-FTAH7-kqTrow2vo", "text": "¬†@interneti¬†¬†(I'm basically out of this discussion, last question) Where is the border of what you will believe? You do realize 99,9 % of things in this world are ones you have never seen, only heard off, all you encounter in media and science, or books. How in the world could you know the air you are breathing contains oxygen and that you need that? Or that there are small atoms that all is made of, or that your body is made of cells? DNA? Do you deny all of these things? Earlier you simply stated that is proveable, how is it any more proveable, it's concluded with the same scientific process and methodology, and if you only trust your naked eye it will get you nowhere near those results. We live in an age where you can edit any picture to show anything, and write anything on the internet and make it look legit. Critique to once's sources is of significant importance in these times. You can't literally explain anything happening in this world by simply saying that's what you see. That doesn't prove anything. Or disprove. How do you know you're chatting with another being at this moment? Electricity? Electromagnetic radiation? Radiowaves? Satellites, internet?! Absurd concepts, I can't see anything leave my computer, can you? Probably some pre-installed program coded to respond. You don't see it, yet you don't even think about whether it's true or not. Of course it is, you're using it! ... that's really not philosophical, nor skepticism, if you don't understand the mechanics behind it, how can you question a theory? You don't even know what you're claiming is not happening. Consider chemistry, physics, biology, geography, sociology, psychology, history, politics, economy... all thought in books, and you can't even take a shit without at least 5 of them being involved. And the concepts covered are almost entirely things you can't and haven't witnessed with your own eyes, or proven, or researched. You have as much proof for those with your eyes as you have for religion. your eyes aren't telling you the truth and most certainly not the entire truth.¬†\n\nAs for conspiracies, who do you trust, if not scientists? There is no group of people out there not looking for financial gain, so that's certainly not a criteria you can use, even though some are clearly more concerned and focused on it than others. Lawyers, doctors, engineers, teacher, white-collar workers, all in companies... you would have to question them all, not to mention politicians. Do you trust doctors, or think they can cure you? Are what they say about your condition true, do they have expertise in the field after several years of studying? Probably not, why would they. They are lying to you about natural causes of diseases and are in collaboration with the food-industry, making you ill on purpose so they can rip off your money by telling you bullox about \"bacteria\" and \"viruses\" causing your ill-being, they are not only lying about the cause, but also causing it. Every doctor in the world, Every single one, no one questions it, no one objects it, no matter that their are doctors in every country in the world, thousands of them, all are in on this little global conspiracy. Denying climate chance because of where you live and your eyes, is the exact same as the example above: it's an invisible cause (pathogens/climate change with greenhouse gases) that authorities (doctors/scientists), who people so worship because they are sheeple, are telling you will lead to your death if not treated (the consequences of your illness/climate change) and are selling you a solution for it for personal gain (medicination/renewable energy), but you'd rather not because you don't trust them and they are freaking pills, you don't even believe in chemistry because you can't see it so why would medicination possible help, invisible cure to a invisible cause, and therefore you conclude: all these various, independent, different people with all backgrounds and different hospitals/universities/countries you have visited are saying the same thing, it could not be that they are right, rather, my eyes tell me differently, everyone else must be in on a conspiracy, and I'd much prefer my money in my pocket rather than wasted on this horseshit because money is obviously all that matters in life, therefore I'm right and the world is wrong. Same methodology, same process, same tools used. If it's symptoms you're looking for, go check nature, there's plenty. Of course, you could have always been ill (as could nature, people who haven't seen a patient or nature in a \"normal\" state earlier couldn't say if there has been a change), and there have always been illnesses with similiar symptoms (both destruction of nature and flues), so what they are now claiming you've been diagnosed with (let's say Ebola or Climate Change) ¬†is unheard of and they want to sell you a solution, it's bullshit and the history (that you can neither prove or see, you are 100 % dependant on books for that one, or scientists in the field making up fun stories to sell you for money) proves that people have always been like this, as has nature, and healed over time, nothing to worry about, nothing to spend your money on.\n\nOh, and 99,9 %+ of the Universe (not only the Universe as a whole, that's obviously out of reach, but what it's made of) is stuff you can't see with your eyes, you can only see certain atoms (roughly 4 % of the universe), and that only when it's hit by electromagnetic radiation of a convenient wavelength, so I'd say you have to deny and are missing out on quite a lot which rationally makes sense and you can understand and witness the effects of in patterns, but not visually see the phenomenon.¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Sebruz", "channel": "UCb_5nwTxrWZBNBaE6w3p3MA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSk8fhWa0OIriDJEc0RDLDxDgPlfUoCQmr96Sva=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I admit I've only read a few comments so idk if I'm off; I'm also only a college student that takes some science classes for enjoyment (ya know, since I think what happens in the physical world I live in is important). What I've mainly seen is a misunderstanding of climate change and a very strong, but blind, belief in religion. 1. The correct term is actually climate change. The temperature is not generally increasing, but temperatures have actually become more unstable. Around my NJ area, anyway, summers have had years of being hotter and winters being colder, for example. However, climates vary naturally. So in a span of 30 years, variations don't mean much. However, if you were to look at a chart of temperatures spanning at least 200 years (to include the Industrial Revolution) you will see that there have been increases in overall temperatures for a few periods, higher than they had been. (Ofc, due to increased CO2, a greenhouse gas, increasing how much heat the Earth retains from the sun, etc) In addition to temperature, more CO2 leads to more acidic oceans, less corals, and less habitats for marine life. As for ice melting, more of the concern for melting ice is typically on land, as Jon said. Yes, the ice would expand as it melts, but an overall heating of a huge mass such as the oceans, would lead to a great increase in sea level rise in itself (although is isn't much of a concern at the moment since different parts of the ocean have been heating and cooling). As glacier lakes or glaciers on Greenland, for example, melt more water will be entered into the oceans and lead to sea level rise. This rise can lead to changing the environments of coastal areas. 2. I respect the thought of believing in a religion. What I cannot agree with is believing in one side and completely shutting out any outside ideas, especially if they've been scientifically proven. \nAs a side note, drastic changes such as a noticeable loss I'm temperature-dependent trees in your area is unlikely. The Earth is big, these causes have long term effects. They may start as something small like ocean acidification, less corals being able to use the bicarbonate they need, less of that habitat for marine life, altered food chains, (maybe less food for the growing population). The point is, climate change is mainly a deep concern for future generations, if not the next one. Either way, early action can be very beneficial with enough of a scientific grasp behind it.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "DanielleWasHeree", "channel": "UCrNWFDL5tVa_xrcYLfbdlEw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS0mghKxDFumDGQtE675TNVt2JJLsx9_CdN1w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's not something you can recognise by feel, because the human body is a bad vessel at measuring changes of temperature, especially something as small as a fraction of a degree over the entire surface of the earth. Oh, that can't hurt us, it's only a small amount? Yup, yes it can. If I recall, if the temperature increases by just two degrees celsius, it could cause trouble. The permafrost of the tundra will thaw, releasing methane into the atmosphere (demonstrated in a Louis Therox documentary I believe) and add to greenhouse gases. This will speed the problem up incredibly, as methane is a worse pollutant than CO2 by a factor of four.\nYou are simplifying things incredibly, interneti, in an attempt to dumb down an incredibly complex scientific phenomena that you have decided doesn't exist because you could make a snowman and found it good fun. It is slow in terms of our lives, but it is very quick in geological terms, and could pose significant risks to sustained human inhabitance of the world in the future, as the greenhouse gases (such as chloroflourocarbons or CFCs) breakdown Ozone (O3) which protects us from harmful ultraviolet light, and reflects light (and the heat energy of the said light) back towards earth instead of releasing it out of our atmosphere.\nI hope this educates you slightly, but I doubt you will.

The waterlevel wouldn't rise in that case, which is the point the guy in the committee makes, and he would be right if it would be as simple as that.\n\nHOWEVER, this doesn't take into account the difference between seawater (=water that is \"salty\") and freshwater (which is what floating ice is made of) and many other factors like water temperature.\nSeawater is denser/\"heavier\" than freshwater.\nBecause of this difference in density of the sea water and the ice, the increase in volume would be about 2.6% of the volume of the melted ice water.\nGlobally, if all the floating ice on earth would melt, the sea level would rise ... 4cm.\nSo the committee guy is actually wrong.\n\nThe major contributers to the rising sea level would actually be water temperature and the ice on landmasses (like Jon Stewart mentions).", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Ted Wres", "channel": "UCqk-5rZKjiojBXPvwdpCfYQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRtYZsOcwuaMsCVVUlZ_nuLfP5o10FZNBQwQpB=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nearly half of meteorologists and atmospheric science experts don‚Äôt believe that human activities are the driving force behind global warming, according to a survey by the American Meteorological Society.\n\nThe survey of AMS members found that while 52 percent of American Meteorological Society members believe climate change is occurring and mostly human-induced, 48 percent of members do not believe in man-made global warming.\n\nFurthermore, the survey found that scientists who professed ‚Äúliberal political views‚Äù were much more likely to believe in the theory of man-made global warming than those who without liberal views.\n\n‚ÄúPolitical ideology was the factor next most strongly associated with meteorologists‚Äô views about global warming. This also goes against the idea of scientists‚Äô opinions being entirely based on objective analysis of the evidence, and concurs with previous studies that have shown scientists‚Äô opinions on topics to vary along with their political orientation,‚Äù writes survey author Neil Stenhouse of George Mason University.\n\n‚ÄúThe result suggests that members of professional scientific organizations have not been immune to influence by the political polarization on climate change that has affected politicians and the general public,‚Äù Stenhouse writes.\"\n\nStewart is a lazy thinker and an ideologue who skews information to meet his needs, unfairly \"skewering\" anyone who dares to have an independent opinion.¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Lady Plantagenet", "channel": "UCXSImP7wrDAj89NrkTgp3mA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQDi-vw9ORhnchxVed54y3tgsbGxX1EqaTYrzaYtw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So for the last 50 years, about 1.4 cm sea level rise per decade were attributed to the eustatic sea level rise. Compared to the overall increase of almost 2 cm / decade, which means that the expansion of sea water by heating plays a much smaller role than the increase in mass of ocean water through water supply from the mainland.

The ability to store the greenhouse gas CO2 is partly due to the water temperature and is an important factor for the global climate. Dissolved oxygen is the basis for the respiration of aquatic organisms. Its the same what you do when you breath. You transform Air ((about 78.08 vol .%) and oxygen (about 20.95 vol .%). There are also the components of argon (0.93 vol .%), carbon dioxide (0.04 vol .%) and other gases in traces) mainly into CO2.¬†\nOh i forgot.... rainforrests are an additional O2 producer to the oceans yes.\nBut you have to know. They absorb CO2 to transform it into o2, this process is called photosynthesis. Technically O2 is a \"garbage-product\" in this process.\nThe same does all the seeweed in the ocean. These plants on oceans and on landmasses do this to exist, to \"eat\". The problem is, the more rainforrests are killed the less catalysators we have and the biological balances is disturbed sensitively.

Air. That is why ice does not form at ocean depths even though its way below freezing. There is no air because of the pressure. You might have methane ice and even co2  ice.

Very kind of you also to not go straight to the standard insults like some others here unfortunately ofc. did. It seems to be the level of debate. We can blame the topic and move on.\n\nI am reading through it and just to sum up the problem I am having.\n#1 we take it as a given in the debate that CO2 is responsible for the 0.6 ¬∞C temperature increase of the last 100 years and will therefor cause a rise in temperature of the stated 1.3¬∞C.\nThat is not evidence. That is an assumption. Everyone knows we emit CO2. I'd like to see the causal link between the two. As of course temperatures fluctuate.\nWe are talking ppm here. 400 ppm CO2 is the naturaly occuring CO2 in the atmosphere. Correct?\nExcerpt from your links [between 2010 and 2060, forcing mean warming of 1.3¬∞C (1.1¬∞ to 1.4¬∞C) above the pre-industrial era and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 less than 430 parts per million. Because these conditions would likely avoid many key impacts of climate change, we conclude that sources of the most threatening emissions have yet to be built.]\nCO2 levels will increase to said 430 ppm, correct? That is 0,003% of the total atmosphere. And yet we as a civilisation are already reaching peak oil and have depleted near half of earth's coal reserves.\nWhat could we possibly burn to actualy increase that above 500ppm?\n#2 The article focuses solely on said CO2 (see #1).\nYou correctly state 500 years ago was a warm period. Temperatures have declined by 1¬∞C since then and we are now reaching the next 500 year naturaly occuring warm cycle.\nYet it seems to be the debate is attributing all of the 0.6¬∞C warming of the last 100 years to CO2. Most extreme here of course Jon Stewart, making fun of the \"wobbling\" and so on. Why? WTF. Ok he is not a scientist but a comedian and I always liked him so no hard feelings.\nBut there exist natural cycles of warm periods do there not?
