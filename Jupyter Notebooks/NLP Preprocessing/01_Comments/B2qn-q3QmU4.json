{"cid": "UgxaVMI9EduQyJYAyYV4AaABAg", "text": "systematic racism = climate change. could u get any dumber? don't answer. i already know. how about some truth i copied a few years ago:\n\nfrom IBD: If they were honest, the climate alarmists would admit that they are not working feverishly to hold down global temperatures — they would acknowledge that they are instead consumed with the goal of holding down capitalism and establishing a global welfare state.\r\n\r\nHave doubts? Then listen to the words of former United Nations climate official Ottmar Edenhofer:\r\n\r\n“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015.\r\n\r\nSo what is the goal of environmental policy?\r\n\r\n“We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy,” said Edenhofer.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to believe that maybe Edenhofer just misspoke and doesn’t really mean that, consider that a little more than five years ago he also said that “the next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the world’s resources will be negotiated.”\r\n\r\nMad as they are, Edenhofer’s comments are nevertheless consistent with other alarmists who have spilled the movement’s dirty secret. Last year, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, made a similar statement.\r\n\r\n“This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution,” she said in anticipation of last year’s Paris climate summit.\r\n\r\n“This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.”\r\n\r\nThe plan is to allow Third World countries to emit as much carbon dioxide as they wish — because, as Edenhofer said, “in order to get rich one has to burn coal, oil or gas” — while at the same time restricting emissions in advanced nations. This will, of course, choke economic growth in developed nations, but they deserve that fate as they “have basically expropriated the atmosphere of the world community,” he said. The fanaticism runs so deep that one professor has even suggested that we need to plunge ourselves into a depression to fight global warming.\r\n\n(me) sounds a lot like what is going on now, huh?", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "TheDaveinga", "channel": "UCfLcY6OcN0DCg9XZ05Cn1yw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKHU87x_9CnAt2hX-C7gaslYGy1FQJGpuDBA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzuKx5zGaUENHzHozl4AaABAg", "text": "Carbon taxes are folly. Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I’ve witnessed it with my own eyes. \n\nBorn and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature’s powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars orbits each planet with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. \n\nSo the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. \n\nThe first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto or paleo diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. This will not only improve your health and eliminate T2D, but more importantly it will incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soils and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. \n\nSee the best keto diet here https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ\n\nThe second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement is as follows. \n\n1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\n2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\n3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\n4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\n5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\n6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nBe positive. Be useful. Don’t be misanthropic with the debunked carbon dioxide nonsense.

John Dewey brought in Humanism to get rid of the Bible. They used evolution, and hence added doctrines into science (so called). This is where the doctrine of abortion comes from, and non accountability to the law.  This is why the laws started to change and are watered down. The Liberals hate accountability. Romans 1:28 “And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;” Most people think communism happens on  dime. We have been lulled asleep for 70 years, and now are ripe for the picking. Believe me I have 0 fear in saying I am not an evolutionist, even though I used to be a Humanist who loved his sin. Now I am a born again Christian, and live day by day.

Secondly, well the thing is I overall do think cancel-culture is problematic. Minor small things like writing a tweet several years ago and then getting fired because of it is absurd. I could understand it if it was something extremly wrong that a person have done (like warcrimes , if the person is still a racist etc) but... that is simply not the case in the majority of occasions. Thats simply wrong. However some things like boycotting Jared from Subway is just right. It depends what it is about and also the share of how much cancel culture you use. With this said: I think it can change to the better. The debatte is on and I do not think the wrong side of cancel-culture will grow much much bigger. Lastly, the thing is while cancel-culture is problematic it is not a direct threat to people's security.

Lincoln wanted to abolish slavery. You know who DIDNT? Democrats! So when they saw that they weren’t gonna get their way and that the Republican states in the north refused to back down on slave ownership to the point where they legit went to war over it and won, then they had him assassinated b/c they didn’t want him going against the Establishment anymore. The same thing happened to Andrew Jackson, John Kennedy and Donald Trump b/c THEY all went against the Establishment psychos who have been funding both sides of every war for the past 250 years.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "AK", "channel": "UCa9LI8aoN7WvM1GovGqkGRg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRucPEsDpy6tVZ-kT0mcspYVWNCsoN1zgcpJgwq0A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxA5iFF3SB51U9yaJh4AaABAg", "text": "If REAL American US citizens don't destroy these Communist inside the United States, they'll surely wake up one day soon and won't be allowed to walk across their own streets without having to show their papers just like Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 40s! As a matter of fact, these people in control of their government right now, stem from these same Nazis from that error. They may not be the exact same Nazi's, but a lot of their politicians heritage is from Nazi Germany and Italy and have the exact same idealistic politics as the Adolf Hitler administration from that error! In fact, Nazi sympathizers from the WW2 error helped hundreds of these ardent Nazis from  Adolf Hitler's own leaders who were responsible for only God knows what all heinous crimes against humanity, and these sympathizers like the Bush family and many others brought these Nazis over here and changed their papers to NON ARDENT Nazis and these men then went in to have great jobs in every important sector including science and Government. IMO there are still the same people with the exact same ideal ology as their former Nazis, and they've used their time well teaching and practicing socialism and naziism in the United States and that's what and why your seeing all the problems your seeing in the United States and the people's struggle to identify and  throw these Nazis out of power and in prison. But it's not only the Nazis that are trying to turn the United States into a Communist Government, the CCP, or China's government has been sending 100s of thousands if not more, spy's and loyal Communist under the disguise of poor immigrants for decade's to send back all the government tech and science and everything under the sun to steal as much if this information as they can to give them an edge in every way shape and form, from science to government, to military, EVERYTHING! If the United States was smart they'd already know all this, but how do you stop it unless you close your borders to these Communist countries!?? That's exactly what other smart countries do, and they don't have these problems, at least not the scale the United States does, and so they can manage who comes and goes. The United States is easy to infiltrate this way. All the Communist party has to do is send people who  they've groomed their whole lives to act a poor poor immigrants but are really trained and loyal Communist and even if it takes these so-called immigrants 10 or even 20 years to get in top position, they can easily do so and start sending massive amounts of secret information back to their loyal Communist leaders or the CCP of China! See, it's not hard to do things like that when the \"bleeding hearts\" who also may be Communist or socialist cry out and use their own PROPAGANDA to help destroy the United States, and if the United States don't shut these people down, and their left who's infiltrated their Government like Pelosi Schumer Schiff Waters Aol Omar and those types, and if the people  don't stop having such bleeding hearts for these type of poor poor lmmigrants and sending them to work in their Government their not foi g to have a United States very long! I mean really, how dumb does people have to be to elect these foreign immigrants to their GOVERNMENT?? Their just asking for something or any country really to take them over from the inside and over throw the people, and that looks like what they've done actually! And the younger Americans are even worse, they've been taught lies in their own school system and their own schools or teachers have taught the socialism from a very early age and now they actually think that's the right way to go, not realizing they've Purposely been lied too and their going to destroy their own Country. I mean how cool is that if your the one who's put all this in place decades ago? Getting their own young people to destroy their own Republic! It's almost funny until you realize this is a simple plan that only works if you have open borders like the United States does, or will have just as soon as that criminal, yes criminal Joe Biden purposely opens the flood gates that President Trump put in place! I mean these people or politicians are doing anything and everything they can against the American people trying to destroy their Country while the media lie to cover their evil plan up, the people go on about their merry way thinking nothing if it, while they do everything to slowly destroy the people's Country! If these people would have tried this just 50 yrs ago, they'd been dragged out from their offices and hanged in the streets! Where did those Americans go? I don't know but, maybe something IS in their water  like poison like the Germans used in their prison camps to make the American and allie prisoner's  more docile and easier to control.

They changed God's SABBATH day. How dare they and teach the whole world to worship on a pagan day.\nSin is the breaking of God's law. \nYou will be judged on God's law.\nPope Francis had a meeting with all the communication executives. He  is behind hate speech. He is banning everyone why? God is warning you in the 3 angel warning message in Revalation for you to come out of her the Babylonian Harlet,  prostitute the Vatican.\nCheck for yourself Vatican is the Antichrist.\n1. The pope's say they are God (this is blasphemy)\n2. The priests say they can forgive sin. (This is blasphemy).\n3. The priests say they can create life. In the mass, eucharist the priest says he brings Jesus Christ back to life daily. (This is blasphemy, Jesus Christ died once for all mankind)\n4. The Vatican says you go to heaven when you die. ( This is a lie, the bible says you sleep in the ground. Waiting for Jesus to return)\n5. The Vatican pope says you go to purgatory and limbo. (Thus is a lie, there is no such place in the bible)\n6. The Vatican, Popes say to pray to statues, and dead people. ( this is idolatry, God said pray to him)\n7. Vatican pope's say pray to Mary.( There is no biblical proof Mary is in heaven)\n8. The Vatican took out the don't worship idols commandment.\nSplit the last one into two. Why? ( God said do not worship anything made of stone or wood statues).\n9. The Vatican, pope changed God's SABBATH day, Saturday to Sunday.\n(God's SABBATH day is Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) \n10. The bible says the Antichtist sits on 7 hills.( Vatican City sits on 7 hills)\n11. The bible says the Antichtist is a political and religious power.\n12. The bible says their colours are purple and crimson.\n13. The Vatican pope's tell people to pray like pagans. Repeating prayers babbling.\n(Jesus taught us how to pray the our father,)\n14. The Vatican controlled the world for 1300 years. They tortured and murderrd millions of Christians.\n15. The apostles said in the bible wolves entered the church.\n16. The devil gave the Vatican the pope's their seat, power and title. ( Rome, money, Pontiff)\n7. God's seal is  in the SABBATH commandment of God.\nName: Jesus Christ the King.\nTitle: creator.\nRealm: The Heavens.\n8. The devil's mark.\nThe satanic secret Jesuit run 666 beast Antichtist Vatican.\nThe Vatican declares it is the MARK of her power to change God's Sabbath.\nRead: THE JESUIT EXTREME OATH OF INDUCTION.\nHere the Jesuits can assassinate. (Kill).\nThe secret Jesuit military army\nInfiltrate every Protestant church. Infiltrate every government. They control every secret society. E.g:\nHitler, Starlin, Churchill, Roosevelt are all level 32 freemasons.\nCoincidence or planned?\nThe Vatican controlled the Nth and South in the Vietnam war.\nThey started WW1 and WW2\nAll the revolutions.

{"cid": "UgzJ6AQkd73fcqNJjPV4AaABAg", "text": "Never give up your firearms Patriot's. They're the only things standing in the way of the DemonRat's and their evil plans. Not only for Patriot's, but all of America, and yes snowflakes, you as well. Remember that Libtards, you are now Useless idiot's to the DemonRatic party. \nCONSERVATIVES DO NOT USE ANQUIFA'S/BLM VIOLENT TACTICS. PERIOD. HOWEVER WE WILL DEFEND OURSELVES.\nDo you actually believe that the government besides President Trump that is currently in place will do the right thing? When have they ever done that? They're ALL Either DemonRat's or RINO'S seemingly bent upon DESTROYING AMERICA from within, thereby fulfilling Nakita Keruchouve's statement that he (Soviet Union) would destroy the United States of America from within. Well, it sure seems like that prediction has come to fruition here with the Anti American DemonRatic party, the RINO'S and their lapdog's the FAKE NEWS LAMESTREAM MEDIA that constantly pass and promote legislation that benefits other nations and invading populations over actual Americans, thus destroying America from within. There is only one way left for our Constitutional Republic to continue, and it is the same way the founders and author's of our constitution did Revolution, 1776 style. And with the way this country is divided, a 1860's style UnCivil War as well. However, The Tyrant's must be removed, permanently. The time to RECLAIM our CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC is NOW!!!\nOur elections have been irreversibly compromised and will never be trusted as fair and impartial ever again without voter ID verifying CITIZENSHIP and ELIGIBILITY. Paper ballots that are not only counted but also verified, MUST be used. However, I don't see that happening under this current demonic governmental swamp that is full of DemonRat's and Demonic RINO's. We really need to just clean house, Period. But if all else fails, then we need to just get on with the purge and RECLAIM the CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC that all Patriot's hold dear... \nGod Bless America and God Bless President Trump.\nWWG1WGA!!! \nI am a patriot, a Trump supporter and I am stuck behind enemy lines and I didn't vote for any of this liberal crap. When I joined the military I swore an oath to defend the Constitution against ALL enemies both foreign AND domestic. That oath has NO EXPERATION date. \nMay God Bless America!!! It is now time for all who love this Constitutional Republic of the United States of America to rise and take a stand! We need to Listen to these Libtarded DemonRat's making threats of violence, and take them seriously and not just dismiss them out of hand. We must be ready Patriot's, as we just may have to lock and load in order to defend our nation from all of these violent Libtarded DemonRat's.\nAn attack by any of those very DemonRat's would bring a level of civil unrest the likes of which has not been seen since the early to mid 1860's. It would most likely make the riots and destruction that the DemonRat's current anarchists that we can't mention, look like a stroll through Disneyland. Do not become complacent in any way Patriot's as the DemonRat's mean to do us harm! Everyone who loves this nation which is the Constitutional Republic of the United States of America must now rise and get out of the trenches and fight the DemonRatic communistic take over, and now stand up and fight for Our Constitutional Republic like your lives depend on it, because in actuality they just might. This action that we all must now take may very well decide whether or not the United States survives as a free nation or descend into a banana republic he'll hole.\nYes, it is time for the silent majority to wake the Sleeping Giant and be silent no longer.\nWe must also remember and put into practice this simple fact. \"God helps those that help themselves\". It is WAY past time to \" Help Ourselves\" in this battle we find ourselves in. \nGod Bless us all!!!  Let's Keep on Making America Great Again!!!  \n         God Bless America.   \n         🇺🇸WWG1WGA 17 🇺🇸\nIt is painfully obvious that the DemonRat's and their lapdog propaganda wing the FAKE NEWS LAMESTREAM MEDIA have declared WAR on ANYONE and EVERYONE that lines up against their Warped, one world, open borders, socialistic/communistic ideology/agenda.\nWake up patriots, it is way past time for our silent majority to be silent no longer. And while I and I believe we despise violence, sometimes it can become necessary when violence is brought against us. Unfortunately, it seems to be becoming necessary as the DemonRat's have already begun to perpetuate violence against us. And it is becoming more than evident that violence is all that the DemonRat's will ever understand. The war is here and now, perhaps it is time to recognize that and begin to respond in kind. Just sayin'.\nCome on people. Isn't it time to realise that the DemonRat's and their DemonRaticlly controlled sheeple and their terrorist arms such as antifa, black lives (looters, rioters and arsonists) matter along with their lapdog's the DemonRatic FAKE NEWS lamestream media have declared WAR on America, its freedom and freedom loving Americans and the DemonRat's did so a long time ago. \nPerhaps it is WAY PAST TIME to STOP pretending that they haven't declared War on OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC which IS the United States of America. \nAlways remember that the DemonRat's, every single last one of them, have turned against The United States of America, becoming nothing but ANTI-AMERICAN, SEDITIOUS, TRAITORS and should now be treated as such. Are you actually surprised by this? You shouldn't be. For a long time now, the DemonRat's have shown that they represent that TYRANNICAL government that the founding fathers warned us about when they wrote our constitution. Why do you think that the DemonRat's fight so hard to disarm the American People by attacking the 2nd Amendment and the constitution in general. It's because the DemonRat's know full well that an ARMED populace WILL NOT get into the DemonRat's train boxcar's willingly. And if you think about it, you begin to understand that it is not just about gun CONTROL, it's not even about CONTROL in general. It is about TOTAL CONTROL. Over ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that ALL Americans can or can't do or say. Does any of this Sound familiar? It should.\nIt seems like the DemonRat's are the TRUE NAZI'S here!!! We are now seeing what took place in Hitler's Germany during the 30's and 40's and in Soviet Russia during the Stalin era, during and after WW2. Just look around and you can see the same thing taking place right here in the United States right now. Yes the history of NAZI Germany and the Soviet Union is repeating itself, but this time the target is America and the Constitutional Republic we hold dear. We must rise against the DemonRat's and their insatiable desire to control everyone and everything and prevent them from destroying anyone or anything that doesn't comply to their WARPED open borders, one world order, socialistic/communistic agenda and ideology.\nPreserve the Constitutional Republic which IS the United States of America!!!\nAll DemonRatic Libtards and SJW's need to be institutionalized, because as we all know, Liberalism IS a Severe Mental Disorder...\nDemonRat's, Libtards, SJW's, SnowFlakes and NPC's along with the FAKE NEWS mainstream media which includes their off shoot \"social\"istic media sites aka facebook, u tube, twitter and anything like them. They are nothing less than a ravenous CANCER that destroys ANYTHING and EVERYTHING this disgusting cancer touches. They truly are ALL Satan's BITCHES!!!\n     🇺🇸WWG1WGA 17🇺🇸\nRemember, SCREW THE \"WOKE\" LIBTARDED, SOCIALISTIC/COMMUNISTIC DEMONRAT'S AND ALL THOSE DEMONIC SHEEPLE WHO TROLL FOR THEM!!! THEY NEED TO QUIT FOLLOWING EACH OTHER AROUND SNIFFING EACHOTHERS ASSES LIKE THE MORONIC LITTLE SHEEPLE THAT THEY ARE... BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS NO CHANCE OF HOPE FOR THE MINDLESS DEMONRATIC SHEEPLE.

Besides, we owe every single one of you DemonRat's for four plus years of your insane crap and we do plan on paying you back. WITH INTEREST... Also, DemonRat's are known for doing EVERYTHING that they accuse everyone else of doing. Why do you think they are known as DemonRat's? They are satan possessed Dominic Rat's, but that, we can do nothing about. DemonRatic policy is always designed to destroy everything it touches, just like a ravenous cancer destroys its host body.

{"cid": "UgzVx8ETi7qhFjC2uKV4AaABAg", "text": "This anti-colonialism things is weird.  Colonialism is an appropriate era of its technology and societies of the world (it is not like they had constitutionalism, that came out of the Magna Carta and its Parliament requirement in how to share power and unmovable kings like King Charles I, where the kings ruled the world, and the king's morality is your morality, and always at war while having absolute knights ruling everything) and part of world history.  It is a shame to cover it up: That it appears as imperialism from another direction, as our deeds of sin require darkness and its ignorance.\n¶\nHere in the United States, we see the Marxist and leftists attack Christopher Columbus and his statues (it is a sign of culture to have such things for every nation of the world); and all Columbus did was set sail in 1492 and find an island in the Bahamas while seeking a trade route to India (the Americas continents were found later).  It was a significant discovery of new, mostly, uninhabited lands that has no sophisticated culture for anybody there, and from a sea captain and master navigator who believed that the world was round while going to the navigation map sign \"here be dragons\" that everybody else avoided: A true master sailor found something new for the maps.  Covering up the past doesn't change where we come from.\n¶\nChaucer's Canterbury Tales is precolonial, and it was a complaint against the Catholic Church and how the priests handled taxes and other king's duties in England before its kings of the Norman Conquest.  It is also England's first works of literature, because the prior kings didn't speak English (where English is for the common people), for being of the same Norman Conquest.  Chaucer was also censored and covered up, we don't have the whole works, as the Catholic Church protected its own.  Like the King Arthur tales, Chaucer was uncovered for the Renaissance and patriotism, during the era of Queen Elizabeth I, and his story, in the results, was dressed up a few hundred years later after the first publication, that created English identity in the English language.\n¶\nMeaning, to remove Chaucer from English schools is a sign, they are losing their identity as a nation and race in the United Kingdom.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "James Mac777", "channel": "UCRmuxqYOKYCi_FWoU5zfVuw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQPRVxIZaezWljj6InPv-zN3mvBY0g8N11IxV4ovQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's described as a \"school of social theory and critical philosophy\". Basically overpaid professors who sit around all day theorizing about this or that. Most of it was never supposed to go beyond academic papers for each other and staying within the university system. Unfortunately it eventually started to leak out, teachers and other \"academics\" with not enough personal hobbies basically created entire lives and identities for themselves -- and lucrative careers -- around \"subverting expectations\" and \"disassembling\" everything in society from genders to relationships.  \n\nOrwell once said “Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals believe them.” because it was true. Being an \"academic\", a \"scholar\", a professor or teacher often means you're pretty narcissistic. If you can make dumb ideas sound 'intellectual' then fellow 'intellectuals' will absolutely pile on to support you. It's become such a meme/joke now that there's pretty much \"social justice mad-lib\" generators online that spit out a bunch of word salad. A couple of people actually got together a few years ago to submit phony, ridiculous academic papers to long established, respected peer-review journals just to see if they would get through. They ALL did. Things like \"deconstructing the phallogy of the whiteness of toasters and the colonial impacts of household appliances.\" That sort of crap.

Who ever the wealthy elitist want to be president that's who will win. I'm sure that's how it goes for all voting. This past presidential election there were a lot of people coming forward to share what they suspected as fraud and straight up cheating. Even people being told they can't vote because they had already mailed in their vote from a state that they lived in previously even though they were not there to collect said mail let alone cast the vote and the vote was always for Biden when they had intended to vote for Trump. These people coming forward signed affidavits knowing that if they were lying they would get charged with perjury stood in front of judges that didn't even look at the evidence didn't want to hear the facts and turned a blind eye. Why you ask, because the Democrats said there isn't enough systemic voter fraud to change the outcome so doesn't matter. Some places even recounted the ballets they turned in as a way to prove they counted correctly. Well if I turned in fake or fraudulent ballets and you wanted me to recount them to make sure they were good or the count was accurate well of course I would have the same number of fraudulent ballets. The only way to know for sure is to visit every person who voted and ask them who they voted for. Now who would do that? That's a lot of work. I believe the election was bought and paid for. When the hole democratic party is saying they have to remove Trump no matter what well then that gives a hole bunch of doubt. Then add to it the fact that they had judges changing the rules while voting was going on. That's not even there job that's a legislation responsibility which is why they didn't go there. The same judges changing the rules are the ones denying Trump fair and unbiased look at the evidence. Now the Democrats say anyone supporting or supported Trump is a domestic terrorist and racist and so on. The Democrats also say that the same people shouldn't be able to get a job or make money or even should be deprogrammed form the brainwashing Trump did. Trump warned america this would happen and everyone said he was lying and just trying to get his white supremacist supporters to riot and kill democrats and 1 VP. Well it's been 7 days and just about everything Trump warned is happening.

Poll watchers were told vote counting would be stopped for the night\n2. Ballots were pulled out and counted after they had left\n3. It correlated with a massive spike in votes for Biden.\n\nDespite admitting these three things, which is the heart of the issue, it is claimed that this video has been \"debunked\". And I'd ask you: why would YOU have taken out ballots in that manner and continue counting without supervision? Trying to come up with alternative answers but it's pretty hard to go with anything other than \"they were stuffing the ballot box\". Even in a place like Fulton, you're not going to have like 90% support for Biden, and that's how these sets of votes were going.\n\nPeople also bring up that Trump had like 60 lawsuits thrown out. 1. No, he didn't. 2. Of the few suits he was personally involved with, none of them were dismissed on the merits. It was the court claiming it didn't have the power or jurisdiction to force a change, or a court kicking the can down the road, or a court stating that the plaintiff didn't have proper standing to file the lawsuit.

He even removed his picture from the wall of the white house. And literally everything attached to Obama Trump attacked. That was what my comment was about. That it's not just Biden trying to undo Trumps policies,  Trump did the same to Obama. Don't read too much into it,  I'm not a Democrat and I'm quite fiscally conservative. But I think both parties have the dumbest spending policies. Democrats tend to be too quick to put us on the hook for things that I wish they wouldn't,  and Republicans love tax breaks that inevitably send more money overseas than to average Americans. Both parties and media that are biased on both sides focus on the wrong things and misrepresent each other and completely bypass the real issues.  Left leaning media doesn't scrutinize Biden's objectively bad plans to fund his actions and the right leaning, like this video misrepresent what is actually happening (like saying Biden is reversing a Trump policy, when in fact he was freezing it for 2 months pending an OMB review. Because if a policy Trump made turns out to be a legal problem it won't matter if Biden let it continue.)

{"cid": "Ugz9fenzX5L1J9Cs8WB4AaABAg", "text": "The other day I was watching Biden carelessly signing executive orders to reverse Trump policies, Something Biden and the left criticized Trump trying to end or improve Obamas policy failings. They arent any better then. They are doing the same to biden and its more vengeful if anything. Its about that and proving a point, a political theater to show off to the world Trump was bad and we will erase that legacy. Think about it people dont be stupid you are all playing a part in this. They dont even care about the environment nor repairing relations. ITs all about political correctness and blackmailing others for their gain as the left always do. To fill their pockets and do everything possible to hide their true dealings and intentions and keep America thinking they are the leaders and know what they are doing. Thats why they keep selling you the slogans, the \"equality, black lives matter, tax the rich, green new deal, help the neighborhoods and other nations and immigrants\" WAKE UP AMERICA this is DISTRACTIONS! Diversions to keep doing the dirtywork behind closed doors and the bought media keeps brainwashing you while they get a cut of it by the left. IT was laughable and sad to see commentators praise Biden saying \"THATS MY PRESIDENT!\" Crock of shit! You are their sheep! The fact people believe Biden is a great already or that its his actual doing and well meaning mind is laughable. You have NO CLUE of these consequences. Hes only trying to appease you with what his base is doing. Biden is the mascot for the left and not the one leading. There's others pulling the strings and its pretty sick and scary for the US. The fact people don't ponder this and look into, or question it or even care is more terrifying. They just sit and watch bias news instill in them what they want and you go ahead with that biased opinion. SHIT MEDIA OFF! The left is responsible for the turmoil we are in. The Media is bought by them and aiding them in pushing this agenda and help convince the nation what they say is right and what their opposing party is wrong and censoring them. They hate Trump because he exposed them. You can dislike Trumps demeanor or how he speaks but name his policies, admit what he's done that's good and admire he's been working for us the people, you cant because you've been used by the media convincing you he's evil and the problem. You are the medias project. The Democrats pawn. Think about these democrats in office who don't call out bullshit and show leadership. Who turn a blind eye and turn their backs on small business and our streets being vandalized, looted, rioted, and burned. Can you actually say with decency and self morals and convictions that its what needed to be done for reparations? For minorities and blacks? Bullshit. Its done nothing to fix the problem but cause turmoil and division. And who ever was a part of it are guilty and it will go down in history as primitive, despicable and not made any impact for the greater good but be a footnote on what people misinformed and uncivilized did. And the democrats knew they lost the nation and self respect. that's why they needed big tech, media and more evil powers to support them and try to take Trump out. When you hate Trump so much that you can let the world burn just to see him fall... Something is really wrong with you. You are evil and or part of the problem period! The fact people don't see this and still say trivial things like \"well Trump is racist, Trump speaks mean, Trump is a bully\" is ridiculous. That's all I hear from the left to try to put Trump down. With no facts or reason or proof why they feel this way and say this. Because the media made them believe and say so. That's why. Well, look at yourself and internalize, is that Hate and anger really yours? Or is it embedded in you by other people's biased opinions and actions? Are you not independent thinking enough or you let people bullshit you and easily convince you? are you that low and gullible? It's always easy for bad people to manipulate others who are blinded by hate and anger and ignorance!", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Alex MPM", "channel": "UCc7-UetIo-vW8f1wNCwKtsQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQOpHf1zIHjv3QRhF9T-tWDob1WV-fuEcue2i7g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's a crap language for getting any work done, since technical terms all blend together due to the simplified phonetic system and complex grammar and etymology, but by God does it allow some downright gymnastic feats in regards to symbolism.\n\nIf you really want to see English at its very best, read Morals and Dogma by Albert Pike, it's a book on freemasonic symbolism and thought, and every paragraph has several layers of meaning with the simplest and most melodic language (and no doubt many more I miss with every read).\n\nEnglish, when properly used, is food for the mind, while my own language, much more specific and structured, is food for the soul.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Cristian-Andrei Necsoiu", "channel": "UCK_VzadjFbAD-DsFXv3Yv0w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQyvnBhzA_ZkGx4AB5ld9B2tnar-xLVzoywcMfd=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I lived 24years as a male to female transgendered person and in my younger years as a fulltime TG (brast implants full name change, the whole TG image and surgeries) I recall training/wanting to be in triathalons but my gut ALWAYS ALWAYS told me this was not right for me to compete in females teams! I knew I was  a biological male despite taking tons of female hormones! I am now disgusted how the whole LGBT has t aken this TG thing to sports and even military. Trust me, male to female  (in my experience with the people I knew and worked with/I was a ParaProphessional Peer Advocate), almost every single TG person that was in my support groups (which I also facilitated), the whole TG was all about sex, perversion, and female enhancements! A very very large amount of girls where fanatical about doing sex work in order to pay for surgeries and some where never ending, never satisfied, wanting bigger breasts, larger hips, more more more! Personally, I believe these group of people should be left to live in our world but there are certain things nature made for male or female only. females are MUCH MUCH more likely to SUCCEED because all they need i is a crew cut hari cut and mael estrogen to pump up muslces and a mustache and will blend in perfectly. Males have to WORK MUCH MUCH WAY MUCH MORE harder! Its becomes such an insecurity for many man of the MTF's that the obsession of transforming to present fully passable as a female is insane! I lived this life for 24yrs, I worked with them, I facilitated groups, and know very well this lifestyle. Finally, I currently have been writing an autobiography with many photographs collected through thsoe 24yrs and hope to one day finish it but it was a very sad life for me and now been living as a full time male after going through reversal surgeries and feel traumatised still a bit, specially with silicone on my ass and Kaiser unwilling to remove it.

This is to keep control.\n\n\nJust look at some of the programs they offer now such as gender studies, composition and rhetoric, and even theatre and drama. What is worse, my experience being in America, is that even valuable degrees consist of low grade education. Plus, in America, you can get financial aid (paid for by taxpayers) for these useless degrees. Oh, and just this past December criminals with drug convictions can now receive a full paid education on the expense of many taxpayers who work at job and are contribute to society instead of selling drugs and gang banging and being convicted, but those taxpayers who have never been in trouble themselves are ineligible or only receive a very small amount of aid even though they are the ones who fund the aid.\n\nI’ve been noticing more and more that more effort is being made for criminals and those who do nothing good for society to move up in the world and to reach positions of authority while honest hardworking people are kept down. The system isn’t only being made for those who don’t contribute to society and live off of people’s suffering by selling drugs and other criminals, it is set up so only narcissistic sociopaths can get to the top which is rare, or those with connections can get to the top.

{"cid": "UgxNfubygUfs3YkjhAB4AaABAg.9IzcYgoKYQd9J103wugw93", "text": "I don't believe most of you understand why affirmative action was originally put into place... It was actually difficult for minorities and women to get ahead back in the day because of the prevailing attitudes of the time (minorities were less than, women were too emotional or incompetent and belonged in the kitchen, etc). Affirmative action, essentially, was meant to prohibit discrimination and create more opportunity for people who wouldn't have had it otherwise. When you look at things like tens of thousands of low income individuals (many Filipinos) being pushed out of their neighborhood in San Francisco so they could \"Manhattanize\" the downtown area (read: GENTRIFY) it definitely shows you something is wrong. It's not enough to displace the people who were native to this land, now you (referring to those in charge of that project and others like it) have to displace low-income individuals and minorites because you're greedy and those who aren't white aren't important? Read about how back in the day, there were many barriers (INTENTIONAL barriers—read: systemic racism) to black people that made it difficult to receive welfare. Read about how just having what some perceive as an \"ethnic-sounding\" name, even to this day, decreases the likelihood of getting a call for a job interview over Natalie or George or Amy when Shaniqua or Zuleika or Jamal are equally qualified. Let's talk about how women are less likely to be viewed as competent in leadership positions or positions of great responsibility, or maybe how they're less likely to be taken seriously when presenting to an emergency room with symptoms (on average men are given pain medication sooner than women, btw), and if you're a female AND a minority? Forget about it. You're mad because you feel you have to work harder to get into school or get a job because you think affirmative action is just preferential treatment of unqualified or underqualified minorities that works against whites?

It used to be a debate before the propaganda empire ramped up in 2016ish.\nIt's referred to as Milankovitch cycles, cycling the planet periodically through multiple ice ages/glacial periods.\nThe Earth doesn't follow the exact same path around the Sun always and forever, slight variations over thousands of years cycle the planet between glacial and non-glacial periods over thousands of years.\nA google image search of \"milankovitch cycles graph\" - the one with the orange background linking to a students paper is easy and non-convoluted to read.  You can see the present temperature dotted line running horizontally across the graph, as well as temperature peaks - much much warmer than today - periodically at about 115K, 235K, and 330,000 years ago - before mankind even existed.\nThe GH effect needs heat trapped to work, as that's what it is.  A car parked in the Sun has heat enter, get trapped, and swamps up the car extra hot via GH effect.\nThe Earth is not like this, it's like a car with it's windows rolled down, releasing heat constantly into space.  The Earth is not some bubble that keeps all the heat in.\nThe main source of heat is basic land/water heat retention.  For 12 hours of daylight, the land/water absorbs heat.  For 12 hours at night, the land/water releases heat.  \"Average temperature\" at any given time, is the equilibrium of absorbing heat/releasing heat - to give you average temperature range the Earth stays at.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Michael Westen", "channel": "UCLepoFaoTT1UJtKAKoe7KdQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT8K6MnvaduyQarqiWDTTcH40hnncxTTuB5D0OD=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And they do not see that as they continue their stupidities, they are quite simply by their own hand ensuring the demise of the education establishment - which gives them their jobs!  as one whose parents were both academics, yet tolerated without rancour a child who intensely disliked school, I have since the 1960s watched with interest the relentless removal of most of what gave education its true value.  Despite my own failure to appreciate academia in its formal setting, I am far from wanting to see its demise.  I always saw that, in the days before its curriculum was decimated, its contribution to society was of vital importance.   I do not think so now, and hope that students today will not waste their money on courses that are merely pandering to passing fads.  And it seems this is happening - now the universities are wondering how to attract more students so they can make ends meet.

I'll share Thomas Sowell's discussion with the Hoover Institution as a way to start of my discussion with you.  Should be a good start to something about \"white privilege\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdHEbOAQFmY&ab_channel=HooverInstitution\r\n\r\nThe article you shared has some very interesting things to note.  First, the author says that  \"White privilege is not the suggestion that white people have never struggled. Many white people do not enjoy the privileges that come with relative affluence\".  At the very last part of the paragraph, the author says that the privilege associated with whites is \"built-in\".  That statement itself conflicts with the other immediately.  You should not have to struggle if you are privileged.  Two, article does not mention anything or any other type of \"privilege\" that comes from other groups as well too.  These two articles (I have more if you want), highlights the possible if not innate privileges that differentiate other race groups.  The consequences are vastly different from each other, so why is white privilege made out to be the problematic one.\n\nFor example, as a Public Administration major and History minor student these two research article in JSTOR is fantastic: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jamerethnhist.36.2.0099 and https://www.jstor.org/stable/1047282  both highlight the rise in Asian success compared to other groups.  This in of itself should be viewed as privilege.  However, your article mentions that there are things that a society has to do in order to \"correct\" white privilege.\n\nI'll end by saying that if \"privilege\" according to your article is \"built-in\" then the same can be said if a white person was in another place in the world.  For example, if a white American visits Southeast Asia, culture, certain cultural assumptions, language, food are all things that that person does not HAVE anymore.  The \"built-in\" privilege ceases to exist. \n\nAs for your article, Tolerance as a source is biased.  Simply going to their About page shows that their mission and goal is the promote as quoted \"Our program emphasizes social justice and anti-bias. The anti-bias approach encourages children and young people to challenge prejudice and learn how to be agents of change in their own lives. Our Social Justice Standards show how anti-bias education works through the four domains of identity, diversity, justice and action.\"  Any kind of source or article written by them will be geared towards that goal in mind.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Anime Shaggy", "channel": "UCLe-2-PQ20WKARaET5vcyAQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ3oWxdGvYqZVkYfOWSIq2RGSOQcK3IDsIBEgU1ag=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwOX4Xp6vAFnN8h3SB4AaABAg", "text": "I believe… what? Do you believe WHAT you want to believe? Or, do you verify verify and verify before you commit to believing? Think deeply about this; believe, in the Cambridge English dictionary, is defined as; “To think that something is true, correct, or real.” A synonym is accept, as in accepting what you are told is true, as in most people accept that what the newspapers report is true. But is it? So, is what you “believe” is true, actually verifiably true? Or…. Not?\r\nToday, world wide, there are more than 41,000 Christian denominations, each with its own doctrines and rules of conduct (Atlas of Global Christianity). Meaning? They, each one, teaches something different from the others. Does the Bible change? Does Almighty God change? Or do the “churches” simply chose to teach what will bring in the most donations? Almighty God is perfect, so how do you change perfection and maintain perfection? Obviously, you can not. He has existed forever, and will exist forever, so change is not something that is possible, or desireable, for Him. Is it possible for us imperfect humans to change? Yes, but more than that, it is something to be desired, by us! \r\n“I thought the Bible would be so hard to understand.”—Jovy\r\n“I felt that it would be boring.”—Queennie\r\n“When I looked at how thick the Bible is, I lost any desire to read it.”—Ezekiel\r\nHave you ever thought about reading the Bible but held off because of feelings like those above? For many, reading the Bible seems daunting. But what if you learned that the Bible can help you to have a happier and more satisfying life? And what if you found out that there are some approaches to reading it that can make it more interesting? Would you be willing to take a look at what the Bible can offer you?\r\nConsider just a few comments from those who found it to be rewarding when they started reading the Bible.\r\nEzekiel, who is in his early 20’s, says: “In the past, I was like someone who is driving a car without any destination in mind. But reading the Bible has helped me have a meaningful life. It contains practical advice that I can use every day.”\r\nFrieda, also in her 20’s, explains: “I used to be hotheaded. But because of my Bible reading, I’ve learned to control myself. This has made me a lot easier to get along with, so I have more friends now.”\r\nA woman in her 50’s named Eunice says of the Bible, “It is helping me to become a better person, to change my not-so-good habits.”\r\nAs those readers and millions more have learned, reading the Bible can help you to live a more enjoyable life. (Isaiah 48:17, 18) Among other things, it can help you (1) make good decisions, (2) make real friends, (3) cope with stress, and (4) best of all, learn the truth about God. The Bible’s advice comes from God, so you can never go wrong following it. God never gives bad advice.\r\nIf you want to know more, please ask, or email me at rich5151@gmx.com.

Two mths later, there was a riot so bad it made national news. Over the next 5 yrs, people moved so they could go to the schools they wanted again & the people chose to segregate. But, the school system just did the same thing again...& again. Not shockingly, the school system has suffered (The private schools are doing fantastic tho lol.)  The point I'm trying to make tho is this: you can say let them segregate if they want & keep communication lines open but, the powers that be won't allow it! It's not progressive enough & also it'd be racist to allow that. Even if the people chose to do it themselves -bc well, they know better than we do what is good & right for us - doesn't matter what we want. The big picture problem is: either you support & encourage diversity or you support & encourage everybody being the same - you can't have it both ways. We need to believe diversity is a good thing instead of those running the show just saying it & then wanting people to pretend were not any different. And by different, I mean unique. It's a good thing - like you pointed out!  Accept everyone for who & what they are BUT... also, everyone is the same.

'woke'. whowouldathunkit? me laughing at the 'cultured ones'. there's that 'st...' word again. \n\nhey, canadians ya'll woke too? got a 'woke' pm dontya? me laughing some more. we go dn u go too.\n\n2. signed us up for the global warming \"woke' stuff. the old head of the un's global warming crapola admitted in an interview that g.w was designed to be used primarily to x-fer wealth from 1st wld countries (primarily) to 'other' woke  places, i guess thru taxation. as a ret. ce i have looked at what this 'woke' crowd is pushing. everybody knows climate is cyclical. places that were once nice and fertile are now deserts. things always change of course. u really believe mankind had anything to do w/ that change? how about those past 6 ice ages? cold >>> hot: cold>>> hot, and so forth. anybody really believe giving these guys our thrillion$ will change anything? that thrillion$, as in a thrill goes up some talking head's leg just thinking about it. cancelling coal and hydrocarbon usage will stop g.w.? if it hasn't already swung back the other way.  not likely. 'winter is coming'. \n\n3. they also floated a 'progressive' tax on existing wealth, every year. fed. property tax just for owning something, and i'm sure they will place some kind of exalted $$ value on whatever it is.  we got a dem mayor few years back and now my r.e. is valued at many times its real worth. just ask them. wish it was worth the city's appraised value, or anywhere close to.\n\n4. hear anything about fracking. cancelling that is on their list as well ya know. more jobs lost. yeah unions helped put this bunch in office. me laughing again. see, it is funny. unions cancelling themselves. hope ya'll unn non-workers got some new 'soc-ist.' stuff lined up. there's that 'st...' word again.\n\ni feel like we are just watching the dismantling of western capitalism. everything he is doing is bad for amerikans. u know, the woke ones who voted for this st... chip. tho i'm thinking even fewer they will soon be. too late to get 'unwoke'. they already did the big 'dumbdown' in the schools. now THAT is something that worked just as they planned. most woke amerikans don't even know enough to follow this stuff, much even less understand what is happening. but wait, our betters are 'cultured'. that must be better than 'educated'. i'll take the letters 'f u' vanna.\n\n5. they are eventually going turn a horde of poor, illiterate, unskilled, covis infected (heading north by the millions) out into our society as well. make them legal and start every one they can sign up on free stuff, and vote of course. guess they figure their adjustable 'computer games' (every 2 years) won't be of much use anymore now that we know 4 sure the deck has been 'pre shuffled'. nice word.\n\nwait until olejo zones out. then we get the real so-com-mx deal. kinda old ussrish is what i'm thinking. just how much will the rest of America take before putting a stop to the destr of our gt country? i gues u guys ovr thr know whn we go so do u, rt? scrued we are. \n\nget csrd much? yes. att", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "TheDaveinga", "channel": "UCfLcY6OcN0DCg9XZ05Cn1yw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKHU87x_9CnAt2hX-C7gaslYGy1FQJGpuDBA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

At least it's a differing opinion and not Leftist propaganda. There are several small independent media outlets and individuals who provide fantastic news and opinion in the US. They are being erased off of big tech at an alarming rate, but they can be found on other platforms. The problem is most people are too busy trying to keep food on the table to search them out. I have severe autoimmune disease and have more downtime than most people to search them out. However, the more absurd things get in the US, average Americans are getting fed up and actively searching for these outlets. It's a good thing to have a more informed populace. Regardless of where you stand politically, censorship is a terrible thing. Your views might be \"mainstream\" now, but they might not be in 20 years.

Only the most dishonest, and partisan interpretation could find such a connection between the two topics. But the Democrats did. The quid pro quo deal was one billion dollars of American money to replace one public prosecutor with another. I assume Joe Biden was an enthusiastic advocate of the quid pro quo theory. But simultaneously, circulating on Youtube, was a video of Joe Biden admitting striking the very same quid pro quo deal with a former prime minister of the Ukraine, namely one billion dollars of American money to replace a Ukrainian public prosecutor with a new one. Indeed, Joe Biden had developed the incident into an amusing anecdote, and was now BOASTING about it for the amusement of his fellow Democrats. In this case, there could be no doubt that the incident was a quid pro quo deal, because it was the very basis of Biden's anecdote. Moreover, Biden had a personal interest in removing this public prosecutor. The prosecutor was about to investigate the affairs of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company in which Biden's son, Hunter Biden was (unaccountably) on the board of directors. \r\n\r\nI am not a US citizen, myself.

I wouldn't have as much problems with them and other MSM if they called themselves political commentators. But they call themselves journalists, yet act nothing like it. Not limited to just them of course, I'm sure.\n\nI'm not sure about the rest of the world. There are a lot of people who are anti-Trump and will call him and his supporters racists and idiots. But I get that a lot when I'm talking to even family members in the US; mostly the younger generations. When I talk to family outside of the US, there is a much more positive favourable view on Trump. And many of the news bits I watch from Europe, Asia, and Australia mirror that view.\n\nI didn't start off as a Trump supporter. Not sure if I would call myself one even now. When he won the election, I just wished he'd do a good job and had high hopes that he would be able to pull off what the professional politicians couldn't or wouldn't. Then years of seeing him being bashed by the MSM pressed me to find the other side of the story; because there ALWAYS is at least two sides to a story. What I found led me to go in search of other views from other parts of the world. My stand today leaning more toward pro-Trump is the result of believing that he actually did a good job, actually did what he said he would do (how many politicians can say that?), and countering the left movements because I see too much of communism tactics and ideologies in them.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "tomcha75", "channel": "UCeCYcXd4I4FUUtdISbImjYg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSKSDN_MGanODgU17myWiGeShISDd8vrgqzZw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In order for that to happen, an ideology that can be wielded to destroy civilization, destroy a people, destroy ability to dissent, and terrify people into compliance must be established. It is the mythical \"white supremacy\" hysteria. In the US, a problem isn't a problem unless you can tie it to white people. We now live in a racial caste system. Eventually, they'll merge the terms of \"white supremacists\", \"the right\", and \"domestic terrorists\" so that they'll be able to hunt down and silence anyone who questions the State. Got a problem with tax slavery? Why that's something a right wing terrorist might say... Into the Camp, citizen.\nWhile the descent of the US into a dystopian totalitarian state is inevitable, the US has one ace up it's sleeve: if you took all the firearms from every military in the world, including America's and counted them, that total would be ONE THIRD of the armory of the American population. That fact ALONE has kept our leaders from becoming rulers. Now that we have a despotic regime in power, clearly they'll need to disarm and paint those who oppose their pogroms as possible threats to the public health. Again, the US will fall, but I'm sure that at least a portion of the country will remain. Of course they'll be invaded by the carcass of the former US by refugees from Bolshevism and the military of the former US, but I'm confident they could become a new nation that will have learned from what we're watching now.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "YouTube Censors", "channel": "UCwbXsbYm6ZwkhysHYQPIuug", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRxansE2ygZ4YehOX6Q41HUh-3GLxSUR0jokIW9Cw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I was 7when he took office. So he would be a large part if this \"systemic racist\" thing. He actually IS the racist, people in my generation and going forward were raised color blind. He was raised at an earlier time when the klan and real racists were very dangerous. He is on record stating he's against black and white kids going to school together, he also stated that all minorities are poor and only white kids had money. Funny, me and my family missed that money train. Poor as church mice, but share what we have. We need a new party people. The \"American\" party, independent if republicans and democrats, they are acting together against us. Playing their\"political roles\" as needed. There were alot if bright young minds that came foward during the summer to call for moderate change, get them to run. We don't need lawyers we need people to run this country.

Secondly, they're not born with them. The sexual characteristics are secondary entirely to the sex hormones, thus the hips develop over time. In particular, one of the definiing characteristics is the size and ratios of muscle and fat as well, the size of the chest cavity, and the neurons that define the characteristic movements. All of this development is driven by the relative amount of the various sex hormones. Thus someone who would otherwise be male, if the hormones are blocked at birth, would look and act identically to a female, but without the appropriate genetalia.\nBTW it's \"bear\" not \"bare\"", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Chris Watson", "channel": "UC-5dpTFwGa_hyhat56q1HnQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTAJ4SHneMC5RZbg_xyOymZVlPG9icHSGgz4A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

PRESIDENT Trump won his re-election with an absolute landslide, and even though there is mountains of evidence NOT ONE COURT has even allowed for all of it or any of it to be presented. Not to mention the fact that there are now over 1,100 Affidavits filled out that could be punishable for up to 15 years if untrue.

The problem is that these evildoers have taken over after decades (and before them, centuries) of plotting in secrecy from behind the scenes, gaining more and more control through various forms of bribery, infiltration, deceit, corruption, murder, increasing power as well as capitol, money and control. Today, at this very point, with a deceiving media and a technocracy which controls almost all financial institutions, production and distribution of goods, mass media, social networks as well as the military (even if in an indirect way), trans-humanism is what they seek to impose. Unfortunately there is no winning against this. The people of this world, for the last 60 years, have been too busy watching television, thinking of themselves, of their money, their cars, their Iphone and all the rest. It is _in part our own fault. Collectively and individually. We, our parents and grandparents have allowed all this to occur. Uncle Sam took care of us and we allowed him to put us all asleep while he was making deals with the very enemies of freedom. Surely, most of the blame falls upon these evildoers who seek to oppress, enslave and exterminate humanity as in accordance with the freemasonic goals set by their Georgia Guidestones monument. They are sick and they love evil, but it is too late for us to reverse what is now irreversible.   Decades ago one United States President warned us about this incumbent nightmare. He was assassinated. Still, the world preferred to watch Family Guy. His words were the truth but the world preferred to listen to the lies:_“The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. And there is a very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. And so it is to the printing press - to the recorder of man’s deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news - that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help, man will be what he was born to be: free and independent.”_", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "The WILD VOICE", "channel": "UCUEqfhsZKUBwQ8SwH5fZ8dg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBaaFz62MN4HIGI0HOH6uUHAo7PTLGOKicgLFY=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
