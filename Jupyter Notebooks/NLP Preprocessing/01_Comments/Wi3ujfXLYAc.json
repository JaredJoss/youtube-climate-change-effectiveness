Is the climate changing for the better or the worse? It doesn't say. Republicans, however, pushed to popularize the term \"Climate Change\" over \"Global Warming\" for that reason, so that people wouldn't feel quite as scared and motivated to stop it, so that they can keep taking fossil fuel money or something else that they overrate to an absurd degree.

{"cid": "Ugw7usi1zWznf38RrlR4AaABAg", "text": "I hate to say it, but it comes down to a lack of understanding the science, and a negative reaction to media panic, bad emphasis on what to worry about for it, and the fact us Americans just don't understand the concept of science on any real level to begin with.\nLet's be honest: When's the last time someone here read an actual scientific paper? Abstract, Methods, Data, Conclusions, what have you. Most people I know have never read one, and hence understanding this crap comes down to word of mouth instead of true understanding. Someone explains the concepts in abstract, sure, but if you just take their word for it, you become the parallel to guys watching Rush talk on the radio about this shit back in the day.\n\nSo, when we talk about climate change, and a lot of people don't understand that they can literally pop open any paper on the topic and read it transparently, or have all the relevant factors explained to them (for instance, people routinely fall for false stories about the sun or other forms of orbital forcing) so they can truly understand it. It becomes a political \"he said\" \"she said\" situation, instead of actually trying to educate ourselves.\n\nA great example is in this video right here, ironically, since both left and right media fuck up on the topic fairly regularly, although the american right wing very much moreso. The guy mentions the ice caps melting, which is actually nothing of true value. Even after hitting the fatal point of CO2 levels, it'd take hundreds upon hundreds of years for the ice caps to completely melt, and what it would actually swallow isn't that noteworthy. We're currently seeing a matter of millimeters of sea rise per year at the minute, and while that will accelerate, it's still symptomatic of sea level rise and ice cap melt not being the true problem... But they are still problems, that's just not why.\n\nSea ice melting will de-salinate the oceans, for instance, in addition to lowering albedo (how much sunlight the surface of the earth reflects, like a guy in a white t-shirt standing outside on a hot day), which will most notably contribute to \"positive feedback\", wherein some warming helps speed up or contribute to more warming. That right there is a serious problem. Polar bear numbers are sketchy on whether they're up and down, due to being hard to monitor with confidence, but acidification of bodies of water will cause massive damage to amphibians, who reproduce in water regularly. More intense heat will give reptiles less time to mate and find food, for fear of dying of heat stroke (the flip side of being cold blooded in action), and melting open sinkholes out in Siberia and other places will release shittons of methane. While CO2 is certainly not something you want to throw out willy-nilly, methane has 20 fold the warming power of CO2, meaning that shit's gonna really help fuck things up if we can't ground our act. Droughts, fires, desync between pollinators and plants, shifts in cold weather due to changes in the gulf streams and the polar vortex... There's lots of shit to be worried about... But just saying \"sea levels\", \"ice caps\", or \"polar bears\" is a meaningless without properly conveying an understanding of why a lot of that shit is symoptomatic of a much bigger, deadlier picture.\n\nDamn near none of the developed world is stupid enough to not comprehend the science properly... At least consistently. We here in America hold a monopoly on being climate science illiterate on a truly political scale, and quite frankly that's what's holding the world back. What is arguably the current world power is too fucking stupid to understand there's a problem, let alone that both left wing and right wing solutions exist to the problem. We've spent so much time denying climate problems on the right that we don't even think about trying to motivate the free market into pulling a lot of the weight for technological advancement that needs to be done on renewable energy sources. Which side has more value is entirely up in the air, but the least we in America could do is have a real, full conversation on the topic instead of trying to educate a swarm of 30 to 50 year olds with the brain of a 7 year old.

Add on that the majority of the problem is major corporations and a failure to properly regulate the system, there isn't a lot the majority of people can do. Our focus is on surviving, and a lot of us can't afford to do more than that. People say \"just go vegan\" like it isn't expensive to eat a proper vegan diet, and much more expensive than a lot of options for people to feed themselves. A lot of us care, but feel like there isn't much we can actually do. Repeatedly being shown that our votes don't matter in a lot of areas (gerrymandering/etc), repeatedly being shown that even if a candidate has shown a history of supporting regulation/preventative measures for the issues they get into office and either hit roadblocks (republicans/corporations) or just fail to live up to the expectation they created, repeatedly being shown that even if we care on an individual level everything above us doesn't. There's a lot of things we want to do, but right now it's very difficult if not impossible for a lot of people. Some cities have it right, increasing recycling efforts and providing more resources for people to be able to do the right thing. Other cities act like they don't care at all. \n\n\nMost products that actually have companies who care are 30-50% more expensive than the general products we buy, which makes it inaccessible to the majority of people. Fair trade/sustainable/green/eco friendly/etc products are definitely something we should be aiming for, but when they are so expensive it's something most people won't be able to do, or won't be willing to do because it would limit what options they have for buying other products. We need stronger regulations on businesses/corporations, and we need to look at who the highest contributors are (china/india/etc). We can do a lot to try and change, but if other countries don't follow suit it's basically asking for people to potentially put themselves into financial hardships for absolutely nothing. There are a lot of things individuals can do, but the majority of it needs to come from the top down. Lobbyists lining politicians pockets are one of our biggest problems, just look at what's happening with the coal industry and other environmental improvement rollbacks. \n\n\nWe care, but it feels like it's a hopeless battle with no positive ending. We care, but it feels like we are ultimately powerless to stop the problems, even if we do all the right things. We care, but ditching plastic bags for reusable ones isn't going to do anything in the big picture without regulation and city wide changes. If everyone had enough money to be able to do the right thing, maybe things would be a little different.

That logic is also a great way to defer personal responsibility and any sacrifice; to hold on the to the excess.  Bravo.  Instead of relying on someone else (or top down) why not start from the bottom up.  Lifestyle is a learned behavior and daily choice.  Leaving your car idling for no reason is a choice.  Using 1000 plastic grocery bags every year is a choice.  Policy is for people that don't know better.  If you know better, you have no excuse.  None of this rationalized avoidance bullshit.  Take action.  Stop having individual items overnighted to your house from amazon (make a list order in bulk and BE PATIENT).  How many tons of fuel would get saved simply buy ordering less or buying locally (merchandise that relies on trucks).  Make your Vote count and go and do it,  reduce the amount of stuff you buy, reuse stuff and as a last resort recycle stuff.  Don't buy excess just because it can be \"recycled\" because depending on where and how this process happens it might end up in the dump or a furnace.  Look in the mirror and tell yourself there's nothing you can do... or is there?  Do your best.  By changing your actions you will internalize the importance of climate change and get out the door on election day.

The jet and rocket engines are by themselves responsible for what is happening to our planet and nothing else is involved. To show this information to be factual and truthful  here are the facts:  There are 38,000 jets in the atmosphere EVERYDAY  of the year during peak travel times and  5,000 during the slowest air travel time everyday of the year. A jet engine burns at 1,200 to 1,500 degrees at the engine. At the exhaust the temperature is 500 to 700 degrees. A rocket engine on the other hand burns at 2,000 + degrees. \n    The typical house stove burns at 300 to 450 degrees and will dissipate water from any size pot over a given duration of time. The atmosphere at ground level is up to fives time thicker then the atmosphere at 25,000 feet and higher - where all jets travel at. \nSince a 400 degree stove can dissipate water from a pot of any size - we should then know without any doubt the results of what 38,000 jets are doing to the thinner layer of atmosphere everyday of the year. \n   What needs to done with all urgency is to use propellers for all national flights within all nations of the earth. The use of jets be used exclusively by a nations air defense and possibly for diplomatic use as well and MAYBE use  jets for international flights. Maybe! Any business that uses jets for transport of manufactured goods they must also revert to propeller use as well because their is no true urgency for the shipment of manufactured goods. Even for international transport of manufactured goods. \n   Our urgent and immediate objective is to  eliminate as many jet engines from the atmosphere that are  initiating the destruction of the atmosphere on a minute by minute - hour to hour situation everyday of the year. The use of jet engines has been around since 1945 up to the present day.  According to the principles of cause and effect the temperature of 38,000 jets in the atmosphere everyday of the year for 24 hours a day are dissipating the planets atmosphere because of how jet engines function. \n   If the suggested actions are expedited immediately - we can be assured of our continued existence. If no actions are taken then we can be confident of our extinction as a species.

I’ve also developed an app to help people seamlessly and accurately track their carbon footprint and compare their emissions to sustainable benchmarks. It breaks your emissions profile down temporally into different emissions sectors (eg transportation, residential energy etc) and, in so doing, helps you strategize ways to reduce your footprint. requires the user to do minimal input (eg occasionally log information from your power bill, or input odometer info - unless you turn on the automated drive tracking feature). There is so much more to it but I’ll spare the synopsis. I’m just excited about it. It’s called footprint and is fully patented and trademarked which is why I’m not worried about disclosing. \nHere’s the thing climate change can only be solved through the full scale mobilization of the private sector as well as governments on local, state/provincial, national, and international scales so this HAS TO BE AN ISSUE IN THE VOTING BOOTH. We cannot solve this through the good intentions of the people that care most about it. There has to be laws and policies that reform markets and the economy as well as generation infrastructure. AT THE SAME TIME we are all part of the problem so we all have to be part of the solution. The time to act on climate change was yesterday so there’s literally no such thing as doing too much too soon. Whatever you’re doing isn’t enough. Yea, YOU! So the goal of my app is two fold. It’s a source of catharsis for people who, like me, loose sleep over the fact they feel like they’re not doing  everything they can. But also it raises the awareness of climate change in the conciounce if people who use the app as well as identifies systemic barriers unique to their circumstances and area to achieving a sustainable footprint. These barriers could be considered public priorities for climate action. So the app could possibly help mobilize. Irregardless whatever you do will just be a small drop in a vast ocean. But a million drops creates a tidal wave of change. My only regret is putting this app in the back burner for so long.\nThe desktop version which runs on excel is fully up and running.

There were large sectors of the American economy (including the entire textile industry) that depended on slavery.  Historian Adam Goodheart says that many Americans “felt a sense of guilt, felt a sense of shame\" because they \"knew that the slave system was wrong but were simply addicted to slavery and couldn't give it up.\"  He compares it to America's foot-dragging on climate change and how fossil fuels are similarly deeply interwoven into the American economy.  “[M]any of us,” Goodheart says, “recognize that in burning fossil fuels we're doing something terrible for the planet.  We're doing something terrible for future generations. Yet “we continue somewhat guiltily to participate in the system.”  \n— NPR 2011, “Looking At The Civil War 150 Years Later,” NPR Fresh Air from WHYY, April 12, 2011, 11:32 AM)  Listen to this Interview of Adam Goodheart by Terry Gross.  https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=135246259 or https://www.npr.org/2011/04/12/135246259/looking-at-the-civil-war-150-years-later \n\nRemaining silent on the issue of climate change today is like remaining silent and acquiescing on the issue slavery in 1789.  They let it happen. They punted it to future generations.  And at the end of 1865 there were 750,000 dead Americans and scar tissue that has affected every generation that followed.  Was 750,000 dead worth it?  They should have fixed it in 1789.  \n\n\"How brain biases prevent climate action. Cognitive biases that ensured our initial survival now make it difficult to address long-term challenges that threaten our existence, like climate change. But they can help us too.\"\n— Matthew Wilburn King, March 8, 2019, http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190304-human-evolution-means-we-can-tackle-climate-change\n\n\"Swift action by politicians is the single most important factor in limiting global warming… The costs of political delays outweigh any possible benefits of waiting for more research into the mechanisms of climate change.\"  — Joeri Rogelj, David L.

Those companies produce products for the other 99% of the world population. So it isn't really the fault of only a few big, greedy, corrupt companies. It is the whole of humanity that consumes too much and does not think properly about the repercussions. One example is paper vs plastic bags in Germany (maybe the whole of the EU): normal plastic bags are always being discussed and portraited as sort of the evil thing that kills the environment. Because of that most super markets started introducing the \"eco alternative\" = paper bags. They are more expensive, more prone to failure (I have bought two and both ripped during the first use, filled with stuff that the old plastic bags would work for 10 times and more) and more energy consuming that the old plastic bags, especially since the plastic bags could be used dozens of times in my experience and then could double up as a trash bag.  The alternative a lot of markets use are sturdy plastic bags (for Americans: they are similar to those blue Ikea bags) or wool/textile bags. Both of those are pretty good from an energy standpoint, the plastic one a bit better than the textile one usually, especially if you use them for years. But the thing is, many people don't plan very well. So they buy a new \"one-time-use\" bag at the grocery store each time they go shopping. And most of those are now paper, which is the cheapest one. So instead of buying a good plastic one for 1.25€ once and using it for years, they buy a 0.25€ paper bag every week and contribute a lot more to ruining the environment, even though they might think they do the right thing. So people are the problem, not the top companies. And the only way to make everyone take it seriously is to go after the wallet in smart ways and not ways that just \"feel good/right\", like the paper bags do. We need CO2 taxation, we need to force renewable energy and not listen to those \"not in my back yard\" idiots that are all around us.

{"cid": "Ugw95T9FmZAB1TVn_K94AaABAg.8uWWpCNZ5iB8u_9xFDRPQN", "text": "From 1978 to 1998 the global avg temp of earth increased suddenly by 0.4 degrees C... and then the warming stopped.  The IPCC can't explain the 'pause', and their models do not predict the observed temperatures of the last 40 years, and their warnings are based on the models.  The IPCC is engaged in climate speculation.\n\n\"Global Warming\" was rebranded \"Climate Change\"...  because the climate has been changing every moment of every day for billions of years, in extreme ways, and always will.\n\nThe correlation between CO2 and temperature seemed promising from 1978 to 1998, but historically its transient at best.  The Roman Warm Period (250BC-400AD) and Medieval Warm Period (950AD-1250AD) both occurred during periods of lower levels of CO2, and well before humans began harnessing and burning hydrocarbons to enhance their lives.\n\nThe global warming theories fell apart by 2006,  but investment in the $climate $industry that began with tax payer funding has continued to grow on a massive scale.\nhttps://www.tesla.com/models.\n\nCO2 occurs naturally and is emitted continually by oceans (70% of the surface of the planet), volcanoes, decaying plant life, and breathing animals.  Each human adds about 800 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere each year just by breathing.\n\nCO2 has a well known property where it's greenhouse effect rapidly diminishes as more is added to the atmosphere.  The next molecule of CO2 has less heat retention qualities than the previous.\n\nCO2 is a minuscule part of the atmosphere.  Only 4 molecules out of every ten thousand molecules of atmosphere are CO2.  150 years ago, before human industrialization, it was 3 out of ten thousand.  In other words, after 150 years of hydrocarbon (fossil) fueled industrialization, plus all the CO2 emitted naturally, there is one extra CO2 molecule out of every ten thousand.\n\nCO2 is essential for life, its not a pollutant.  If the level dropped below 1.5 CO2 molecules per ten thousand atmosphere, plant life would struggle to survive.  In fact more CO2 might be a blessing in the fight against world hunger... CO2 is plant food.\n\nThe current level of CO2 is 400ppm (parts per million, or 4 parts per ten thousand).  NASA considers a space station safe with levels up to 3000ppm to 5000ppm.  Submarines are considered safe up to 5000ppm to 8000ppm.\n\nArctic ice is melting, but only represents 1% of the planet's ice.  The Antarctic and Greenland hold the other 99%  (90% and 9% respectively), and both have seen their ice increase significantly over the course of the last 100 years.  They build research centers in the Antarctic on jacks so they can raise them up each year to keep up with the ice/snow accumulation.  Here's a story about a plane (Glacier Girl) that made an emergency landing on Greenland in 1942 and was discovered under 270 feet of ice in 1992... after 50 years of post war hydrocarbon fueled industrialization.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Girl\n\nWe could go on and on, but basically the planet stopped warming (and only warmed during a blink of an eye 20 year period),  the climate models don't predict observed climate, the climate warnings are based on the models, and there is a great deal of historical evidence of warmer periods with lower levels of CO2 well before humans began burning hydrocarbons.\n\nIt's all a bunch of speculation.  In the early seventies, scientists were speculating on the coming Ice Age.\n\n\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas by far.\n\n\nThe earth's massive water system and the Sun likely play far more significant roles in the natural variability of climate.  The idea that the tiny bit of CO2 in the atmosphere as the 'primary forcing agent' driving temperature and climate is simply not supported by objective science.  Not even close.\n\nTo be sure, the $climate $industry is $massive. The banks trade $trillions of $dollars of carbon futures every year. Those banks donate $hundreds of $millions to the cause.  It's great for Tesla shareholders, and of course Al Gore made a fortune promoting it.  The $climate $industry is generating a great deal of wealth.\n\nIt's also uncaring. The cost of energy drives the cost of food, clothing, housing (protection from climate), healthcare, transportation, education and every other aspect of modern life.\n\nThe regressive climate policies and carbon taxes of the rich continue to keep the 2 to 3 Billion of the poorest people on the planet the poorest people on the planet.  They are poor because the most basic form of wealth is access to energy.  It is energy that has allowed humans to thrive.\n\n1 to 1.5 billion only have access to biomass energy (wood, cow dung), and another 1 to 1.5 billion have no regular access to energy... in total roughly 8 times the population of the United States.\n\nIf you don't believe any of this, that's wonderful, you're a skeptic.  Do the research, its at your fingertips.  If you haven't looked into the facts yet you believe, that's faith not science.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jim R", "channel": "UCgYLRYIJb9KnxdayIRaIfmg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQYGvg-LubX_2YLTt8vz23QWnqIwMrlG63Nlg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Local climate is basically the likelihood of certain temperatures, weather phenomenons, etc. occuring in that region.\n\nFor example, you can have the specific weather \"snow\" in the Sahara, but the regional climate there makes it a very rare, unlikely weather condition to occur because the basic conditions in terms of temperature, wind, oceanic streams, etc. are not very likely to lead to snow. \n\nWhat climate change does is that it heats up the base temperature of earth (global climate), even in regions that are normally cold (specifically the poles). It's not much, but that BIT of difference is enough to throw massive systems that are the cause of regional climates completely out of whack (for example, the jetstream, the north atlantic gyre, etc.). \n\nThat leads to rare, extreme weather conditions, that USED TO only happen on very rare occasions, to happen very frequently now because the basic systems that create our climates don't work properly anymore.\n\nSo for example, a cool area, that used to rarely get a hot spell before - aside from short, occasional highs or lows that happened to move some warmer air from southern regions further north (weather) - may now have constant, neverending heat because the jetstream is going straight-up south-north now instead of west-east and constantly shoving massive amounts of heat to the northern region (changed regional climate) which may be alleviated or strengthened from time to time by the weather, but overall the region is now consistently much hotter, yet neither the plants nor the animals or lifestyle of the people in the region are fit to deal with that.\n\nOfc that was just one of many examples, your specific region doesn't necessarily need to become hotter, it could get colder too, or drier, or more wet, or a new tornado corridor could form, and so on and so on. \n\nAll of that has nothing to do with the daily weather. The base conditions for each region are getting all f*cked up because we are raising the overall temperature of the planet's atmosphere.\n\nSo yes. There have always been floods, droughts, unusually warm winters, severe thunderstorms and whatnot. But what used to happen once every onehundred or onethousand years with this level of severity is now a yearly occurrence because the base conditions have changed.\nSo no. THIS has NOT always happened.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the direct effects of a higher global temperature, like the rising sea levels for example.\n\nTL;DR\nChanging global climate messes up the systems that produce regional climates, which affect how likely different kinds of weather are for that region.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SleepySera", "channel": "UCfWIv4EdlpBAEX8FFnxTN9Q", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTQsHhNNhY3Tis2jfvU3e6xBcWOIVlE_xQvnsCu8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

How good are the chances of people to vote for you, if all you do is weaken the economy, because of all the necessary environmental laws? are the problem the politicians who want to save their job, or the people, who would vote for the other guy who promises to strenghten the economy in the next election? they would just risk their jobs without any impact, because after 4 years, all they have achived would be gone and they would be without a seat in the gov.\n\n3. you want rich people, so about 10% of the population worldwide, to pay for all the changes, so you and the other 7 billion idiots can keep living like they do? don't you realize , that the demand of ressources is the problem? waste and environmental damage is just a side effect. the pure amount of people you need to supply is the problem. you may save up 20% of everything with a huge efford, but what are you gonna do with the other 50% demand that is to much? we need around 1.7 times the regrowing ressources of this planet, can you save up over 1/3 of what you have? can the people that have nothing do the same? don't get me started on things that DON'T GROW BACK. like metal and all these obviously unimportant industrial ressources.\nthey get rich because people buy things, they didn't get rich by sacrificing souls? WE are the reason. WE are the problem. if they would stop being rich, economy would be down, and you with it. if 50%of the wealth is occupied by 5% of the people, what do you think the other 95% would get if we split the wealth up equaly? less than double of what they have now, and for a lot of people that means a few lousy bucks more. and that's wealth, income is a whole different level.  so, who is the problem? You and your stupid thinking of blaming others or am I the problem?\n\n4. The biggest mistake you make: thinking it would be cheap and easy. \n\nwe would need to restructure every branch of economy, from ressource gathering to transportation and distribution. just to stop us from polluting the environment any further, there would still be the problem of what we have already done. \nit would basically double or even tripple(depends on the Type of goods) the production costs for EVERYTHING. So either every company drastically lowers their profit, basically going bankrupt, or drastically increase the prizes, killing the economy. even a compromise would not make much of a difference, just slow the whole thing down. i'm not even considering the massive amount of NOT regrowing ressources that would be necessary, and how that would affect the prices. or the fact, that 70% of all people on this planet live in weak economies, which would be destroyed within WEEKS, maybe months, depending on how serious we take the whole thing, as we did nothing the last 50 years any now suffer the consequences. billions of people would starve or revolte. the next 20 years(according to many scientists, some say 30) are the most important ones, when we don't start doing something fast, we can sit back and wait for the end.\n\nnow, to come to an end, what is the real problem? the billions of self absorbed, others blaming idiots, or the few who act upon the actions of these idiots?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Mister Twister", "channel": "UCLaVyfdobqCjLxgfrQg1kDQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkRvg0P9myON9f5ZCUMwuM5a9wK_z7jaq1xA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgykeeZURekAwyYJjDF4AaABAg.8uWV6vew7aT8uiQbTSVc4S", "text": "​ @Mister Twister  1)No, I don't think the higher ups are saving money, that's why they have \nso much in material possessions.  And maybe they don't have money in our system, that would mean they would have to pay more in taxes, or even taxes.  And you're trying to convince somebody that the \"distribution is off\" when these people are making more money than they know what to do with.  A little off seems a little too lenient.\n\n2)I believe the USA is a great country, and I'm proud to live here.  That being said, I don't believe politics is much more than a puppet show.  Without looking at any stats, just my observations, I would say the majority of politicians are looking to line their pockets and themselves with the right corporations in order to set themselves and their campaign contributors up.  While I don't believe any set system will work forever (capitalism has done well, but it's just the beginning.  How much credit can every industrialized country really have with each other?  That's not a house of cards being built to fall?) I also don't believe having people in government who are mostly motivated by money is a good solution.  And the job thing, while other positions in government aren't as secure as some, do you really think we're being democratic about things?  You don't think some get rigged, others outwardly over turned (like when the electoral college overturns the majority vote)?\n\n3)I think you're being too kind with the 10%, I would go lower, but sure, if you're willing to go up to the 10% I would too.  I believe it's something like the top 1% own 90%, but you're numbers are better.  And no, I believe the population is a problem, and something else that needs to be addressed.  I don't think having a limit on children is a bad thing in theory, but being able to do that worldwide would be almost impossible with religion and personal freedom coming into play.  I don't see, however, how giving more money for people to spend on our economy would be a bad thing though.  These people would still be rich, they just wouldn't have as much.  The former Governer of Minnesota Jesse Ventura suggested not a minimum wage increase, but a maximum wage cap. That seems reasonable to me.  And going back to the companies in general, what if they didn't use materials that needed to be thrown into landfills?  Why don't all companies have biodegradable plastics?  And you seem to be confusing what I've said with socialism, or communism.  I never said that the money should be split up evenly.  If you don't work, you shouldn't get money.  However, I do believe that people in teaching, or in the healthcare field (LNA's and nurses to begin with) should see an increase in their pay.  Teachers are building the future of our children, and they are responsible for their well being.  Would you be more willing to put in your all if you were making 100k a year as opposed to 45k to deal with little kids who tell you to go f yourself and then have their parents try to threaten your job?  And an LNA has probably literally cared for a person in your family to ensure that they are taken care of.  They get 30k a year on average to care for human beings.  Meanwhile, the CEO of the company they work for (possibly got the job because of nepotism, but maybe not) gets 13 million... 13 million.  And you're trying to convince me that he shouldn't get a reusable towel program that may cost him more per year to run per year, but instead should just throw every towel away once it's used?  You're throwing a lot of black and white images out there, where I was going with more of a grey tone.  I believe it's everybody, and all people can do their part, but I do believe it starts from the top and goes down.  China is out of control with it's environmental issues, and if I'm not mistaken they're pretty much spearheaded their own problem and are one of the leading, if not the leading industrialized country in renewable energy.  I'm not even saying that it's going to change the climate, we don't know what the Earth is going to do.  I'm talking about polluting the air that children live around, I'm talking about foods being sprayed with chemical that is known to cause cancer.  Back to the house of cards reference, it's all being built on a crumbling foundation that can't sustain.  Can we fix everything?  No, but we (that's everybody, corporations down to the single parents) should strive to do something better.  I don't believe that will happen, but I have to try to stay positive.\n\n4)I've already talked about this, but just to go point for point.  No, I never said it would be cheap.  I didn't say it would all magically get fixed, I never even think any of this will happen, I just hope that it does.  We all know for a fact that there are many ways to cheapen certain expenses.  The biggest problem with going more environmentally friendly is that it will put other companies out of business.  Would it suck for the oil companies if a big chunk of their market was hit, of course, but that doesn't mean bankruptcy is a forgone conclusion.  With how companies are mismanaged and trying to continuously up their bottom it would be hard for a lot of them (thinking back to the big bank bail outs a while back, you know, the one people paid for, and then the CEO's got record breaking bonus'?  Yeah, see, I don't think that was a good use of our money, and if banks hadn't been chasing the immediate dollar signs being waved in front of them, but had a more realistic, sustainable growth plan, then I'm thinking it could have been different).  The only thing I was really implying is that the people who make the most money should be doing their part as well.  Does it mean that they won't be able to buy 5 yachts?  Yes, yes it does.  Oh well, they'll have to deal with only have 1 or 2.  \n\nTo that end, I would say that the problem is the world in general.  Instead of using money for good, it gets used for greed way too much.  Not everyone is like this, and there are plenty of rich people who do and mean well.  Then there are companies of dodge paying taxes.  And we're not just talking a few dollars.  Imagine what could be done to the public school system (just to start with) if more money was put into it?  But instead of money being put back into the infrastructure of our country, it's in offshore accounts.  And again, I don't think I ever outwardly demonized corporations while putting the common person on a pedestal for this.  I was simply reading through the comments and saw a lot of people talking about what they and others needed to do individually, and I wanted to let like minded people know that corporations have a big part in this as well.  I don't feel like I can accurately answer your question, because I don't feel either one is an optimal choice.  My personal opinion is that people who have a lot of money tend to think about how they can spend/use that money for themselves and not the greater of humans in general.  Again, because for some reason I feel that you're the type of person to look at the one tree in the forest but not the whole forest, I don't say this about every company or wealthy person. \n  I don't think any person is an idiot for trying to make some sense of this crazy world.  That's great that you have your opinions, and you may be right about them.  I personally don't think we can really know yet, because we haven't gotten to that time yet.  In the grand scheme, we know very little about what the future is going to hold.  We can pretend that building this house of cards up will be sustainable forever, but my money would not be on that being the final outcome.  I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just not a person who is easily convinced of things that aren't yet observable.  And when that person insults my intelligence and then goes on a tirade that is nothing more than inconclusive stat's and predictions that other people are making, I'm even less impressed.

{"cid": "UgykeeZURekAwyYJjDF4AaABAg.8uWV6vew7aT8uik_s_kg27", "text": " @ImInPhilVIlle25  1. Like all us citizens, you automatically assume that the US(327M people) is the centre of the world and you can use it as an example in a debate about the whole world. You do realize, that the us has more problems than other countries with a comparable economy? And the world has 7.6B people, using the us as an example might be useless when it comes to a world wide problem.\n\n1.1 have you even considered, how they got the money? And that owning a company or investement is something entirely different than an average job? Why should they pay more, just because they have more? Same cut for everyone, or else you just force them to leave your country, or invest all their money in buildings and ressources like gold, effectively making them less rich when it comes to money, do you gain anything out of that? And again, they are just playing by the rules that the people gave them.\n\n2. Maybe i can clear things up here. You say politicians are just stuffing their own pockets and do not really care about the people. And thats not entirely wrong, but stupid. I use your example with the electoral college, something i find stupid as hell btw, and ask you, how they got the power to overthrow the public vote? They told the right people the right things and they voted for them, so they could win the necessary states. No politician can do this on their own. And here comes the problem with the system: Democracy, like it is considered today, is damn stupid. Right now, you get peoples opinion, not the right answer. And that is, what every politician wants, they want to please their opinions, so they can get their votes. Of course they have to promise a lot, but can only do a little. People do not think about the negative impacts of the actions they demand. Our politician could do more for the environment, but the moment the prizes rise, and the taxes go up, people would complain, because when the money get's low, we tend to not give a sh** about the environment anymore. Would he get reelected? Or would people just vote for the next best idiot to promise them a better future and tax cuts? Why should our politician do something about the environment, if he just loses the next election, his job, and every achievement he got during his time in power? See where i wanna get? It's the half knowing idiots who are allowed to vote who are the problem. If the world where full of smart and educated people, no politician would need to lie. But people want things and they don't care much about the negative impacts, but they love to complain about them.\nShould they have let the banks go bankrupt? Wanna bet how many homeless people they would have right now? It wasn't executed perfectly, but it wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be.\n\n3. Now i tell you something about big companies. Why don't they use your plastics? Because it would cost them millions. And it's not just that, because if you start with one thing, 20 others come as well, and soon you lose a lot of money. Why is that bad? i give you an example:  Let's say they(CEO's etc) get a million or two more for, let's say 4-5% increase of profit, thats a couple hundred millions for a big company. See how much the difference is? The money is used to invest and keep the company healthy, which secures peoples jobs and their future in the company. If the CEO where to go the eco friendly way, and he would lose some profit(thats what would happen), he would get fired, investors would leave and the company would have a problem, which would be bad for peoples jobs. Why the hell should he do that? It's the same system from the bottom to the top, they are just living in it, cause thats what you can do, otherwise you are screwed.\nNow in regards to the mentioned income max. , you would simply take people the drive to go on, why should i increase the profit of the company, if i am already at max? Would this help anyone? Or would you exclude shareholders and investors? Cause then i would simply take my max money and do the same, and there wouldn't be much left for the bottom. Stupid idea.\nAnd do you really think the CEO of google has the time to look into every departement and every contract to find where he can save money? It's the small people who want to get higher that find them. He is just happy to sign them, make a bit more profit and keep his job. As long as careers are a thing, and the system that enables them, this is how it goes. Problem is, there isn't a better system(i mean capitalism). \n\n4. I used my example to show you how much money we are talking about, and that every persons share wouldn be that much, because you would have to invest for every person on the planet. And now think if it would solve anything, if people had the mentioned amount more. They couldn get houses, not even a new car, and we should build up a new infrastructure with that small amount of money? The problem is ONLY the demand. And less children are stupid as well, because then you have rising numbers of old people and a falling numbers for young people, who produce everything. Can't really do that as well. I use so much black and white, because grey is a compromise, and we are 50 years to late for compromises. I'm just damn tired of people who argue like you, with a severe lack of basic knowledge but huge amounts of optimism. It's time to wake up an start acting RATIONALLY, not trying to shift the blame back and fourth(what you basically did, if i compare your first with the last post) or honeycoat everything and make the changes as comfortable as possible.\n\n5. You seem to misinterpret how this universe works. If you run towords a wall and you see it, you would stop, would you? Or run around, turn etc. because you know what would happen otherwise. If i blindfold you, you can't see it so you have no means to change something in the right way. But the future is VERY clear and we can see the wall getting bigger and bigger as we come closer. I'm not a prophet, i'm someone who looks at facts and acts upon them and right now, there is not a single fact that tells us, that there is a good outcome if we don't change drastically, how we live on this planet. Except maybe, that without humans, the next generation of plants or animals(once the world has recovered) is better of without us. If you like that kind of thinking.\n\nI did not insult you're inteligence, i called you dumb, because of your words and thoughts. There's not much information for me to judge about your intelligence, or what your brain is capable of. However, i can judge your thoughts. The way you use your intelligence. Do you think, reading a few books and getting a basic level of understanding regarding a lot of things makes me even a bit smarter than you? It's knowledge, nothing more, but i can judge better because i have it. That's what i am acusing you of: knowing not enough to talk about the things you do, thats why i wrote dumb and stupid. And i'm rude, because you and the people who think and act like you, are the main reason we got here. Instead of just acknowleding the problem, studying it and finding a solution, people act upon a lack of knowledge, mixed with a good amount of optimism or any other ideology and produce nothing but crap. That's of course not your fault alone, but it is tiresome, to have the same conversation again and again, proofing people wrong again and again and then go back and start from zero, because there are just too many of them. It is my way of trying to change something, by getting people to realize the stupidity of their thoughts fueled by group mentality and moronic ethnical standarts, because at the end of the day, only rational thinking can get you anywhere, but i'm not going anywhere, it seems.\n\nedit: i'm not against optimism per se, but you have to do everything you can and then hope for the best, not do what you think is enough and then hope that you are right", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Mister Twister", "channel": "UCLaVyfdobqCjLxgfrQg1kDQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkRvg0P9myON9f5ZCUMwuM5a9wK_z7jaq1xA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You can say that \"it will just increase the price of everything,\" but the only reason for that would be because greedy companies needs to meet the bottom line of greedy investors.  So, in my opinion, if companies across the board, investors, everybody, realized that for the better of the human race, they will all need to eat a piece of poop pie.  Their piece would be small compared to a starving child, but it would make the whole world better.  A magic fix to everything, no, but a start.  To emphasize the point, again, I realize that this is practically impossible.  I would never expect a person to get over themselves enough to realize that maybe 10 million isn't a lot in the whole world economy, but 10 million is life changing for some.\n\n\n3)  Lol, I don't even know how to respond to this one!  One of the best so far, I must admit!  So, I guess it has to depends on several factors.  Black and white have a lot of finality that come with them.  If you consider a compromise anything from that, then sure.  However, if you consider paying your taxes legally a compromise, then we can't possibly ever agree to anything close on this subject.  Grey area to me represents possibilities, or even the unknown.  Nowhere in the definition of grey area is there any mention of compromise. \n\n\n\n4)  I do believe that Trump has a lot of rich friends, and I believe (as I have already stated) that he isn't much more than a puppet.  He represents more than he has any actual control or power.  He was elected in by the electoral college, even though Hillary won the popular vote.

You're still spouting off what \"has\" worked, and the only reason why it has worked is because the people who founded it, especially once the Great Depression was over, worked VERY hard to make it as sustainable as possible.

If you read what I originally stated, I never exonerated people from what this has turned into, I simply saw that several people were saying how individuals needed to do more.  I simply pointed out how corporations have a key role, if not a slightly bigger one considering the power that they have.  We might not even be talking about plastic bottles if companies never abolished their return policies.  Was it perfect?  No, but it made people pay for a bottle if it wasn't returned in satisfactory condition, the company would then wash, sterilize, and re-use glass bottles.   It was only when companies said \"wait, I can produce plastic at a CHEAPER cost, and then we don't have to process the glass bottles that come back!  We pay less to produce the bottles, and NOTHING comes back, so we save MORE money!\"  Of course we all should know this by now, and most people should understand that while yes, it's up to them as well, that if companies hadn't looked to MAXIMIZE their profits (not saying it's not smart business to maximize profits, but when it starts coming at the expense of the human race as a whole, that should be a red flag), then we wouldn't have to \"recycle\" so much plastic (the reason why I put recycle in quotations is because most of the stuff we recycle just ends up in landfills anyways, so what is the average person supposed to do, make their own multi million dollar recycling center). \n\n\n\nI'd say I'm pretty even with my bashing.

In one sentence you say that you never said any of those things, and then turn around say a bunch of things I never said!  Troll gold 101 please!  Here's a fact sheet because I don't feel like typing it all out:\n\n    Tax avoidance through offshore tax loopholes is a significant reason why corporations, which paid one-third of federal revenues 60 years ago, now pay one-tenth of federal revenues.\n    U.S. corporations dodge $90 billion a year in income taxes by shifting profits to subsidiaries — often no more than a post office box — in tax havens.\n    U.S. corporations hold $2.1 trillion in profits offshore — much in tax havens — that have not been taxed in the U.S.\n    General Electric, which uses a loophole for offshore financial profits, earned $27.5 billion in profits from 2008 to 2012 but claimed tax refunds of $3.1 billion.\n    Apple made $74 billion from 2009-2012 on worldwide sales (excluding the Americas) and paid almost nothing in taxes to any country.\n    26 profitable Fortune 500 firms paid no federal income taxes from 2008-2012. 111 large, profitable corporations paid zero federal income taxes in at least one of those five years.\n\n\nThis is all done with a simple search.  Try explaining to me how dodging out on 2.1 trillion dollars in taxable money is helping our country? \n\n\n\nCompanies are made through supply and demand, it's very simple.  What's not simple in trying to convince everybody that not only is it that brand that you need, but that you also need a new one every couple of years.  Not to mention that companies now don't make things like they used to, companies have admitted to it.  Why build a TV that will last 75 years when you can get people to buy a new one every 5-10 years?  That's not just supply and demand, that is also manipulative.  Why do you need this beauty cream?  Because you won't be as good looking if you don't, and then your value as a person is less because the perception that other people have of you might be negative.  That's like psychology 001, the very basic.\n\n\nThe fact that you are trying to keep a point tally on a discussion with a person you don't even know shows how immature/young you are.  If we knew where the economy was going to lead us than fine, but we don't, because it's never done this well before (capitalism).  Now you sound like a person who is trying to tell me that the ozone is depleting and it's our fault, even though we know generally nothing about the ozone layer.  Do we know more than any human's before?  I would say yes, but that doesn't mean that we know what it will be doing over the next 5,000 years, not even long enough to be the blink of an eye for our earth, who has been doing it much longer than we've been around).  Those aren't facts, they're predictions.  We are at a period where we don't even have the resources to back up our debt anymore, the industrialized world is racking up debt like a credit card, and yet I'm supposed to believe what these \"experts\" are getting paid to say?  Uh huh, seen that movie before.  Didn't another person make a movie like that, saying that all blonde haired and blue eyed people were the pinnacle of human creation, while attempting to commit genocide on another population?  Hey, people didn't have any problem with that until it all came crumbling down around them.  How so?  How do you think they kept such good and accurate records back then of all of their work?  You might have heard of a company called IBM?  Yeah, imagine that, a great company sold equipment to Nazi Germany, and just turned their heads the other way.  But companies are just doing what the people want right? \n\n\n\nThis is why I refer to what you're saying as opinion, not facts.  We have no way of really knowing what is going to happen.  Maybe you're so concerned with yourself that you lack the ability to look hundreds of years into the future.  The fact is that the world is going to crap, and a lot of corporations don't seem like they really care, and I would even say that they're doing more today than they did 60 years ago to ensure that they get their own.  You might see it as progress, but I don't.  I see it as trying to stop a dam from bursting by having people patch it with band aids.  Could some of the opinions you're stating turn out to be true?  Sure, or maybe they just go away like that Austrian man's did.

For the German's as a whole back then, they weren't upset with having nice things.  The economy was booming with Hitler in reign, and they certainly did not mind the nicer things in life.  If they were so against any of this, I\"m pretty sure he wouldn't have been elected after all of the trouble they went through during WWI and the sanctions that were levied against them.

Hindsight is of course always 20/20, but to cite my other reply, he was voted in bro, after being slapped really hard after what Germany attempted in WWI.  They voted him in, and when he said \"let's kill all of the Jews,\" he had people lining up to help. \n\n\n\nI never said physics has a problem, I simply said that even the laws of physics break down in a black hole.  You're the one who brought physics in from the beginning.  I talked about psychology, next thing I know you're talking about physics.

Mice and humans share 92% of their DNA, and yet are very different in how they function on a day to day basis.  While I could argue \"well, we both breath don't we,\" or \"we both need to eat to live,\" that in no way means that human's are going to be mistaken for mice any time soon.  Hell, we can't even make good medical discoveries because when we test things on mice, they hardly ever work on humans as intended.

Schreit zwar nahezu \"Übersetzungsprogramm\", aber ansonsten ist es sehr passabel.\n\n\nNun zum Rest deines Hirnverbrannten Schwachsinnsvortrags.\nDu sprachst von Nagern, nicht Ratten. Aber ich nehme einfach mal an, dass liegt an deinem tollen Übersetzungsprogramm^^ Und du hast den Schluss gezogen, dass zwei Dinge magisch das selbe sein sollen, weil sie aufeinander basieren, was gelinde gesagt nur deine unglaubliche Dummheit unterstreicht. Ich sagte es basiert aufeinander, also wäre der korrekte Vergleich der zwischen der DNA und dem letztendlich zugehörigen Lebewesen. Einfach gesagt: Ich besitze einen gewissen DNA-Code und der bestimmt, dass ich ein Mensch bin, oder willst du behaupten, dass sei nicht richtig? Die Physik hat uns gelehrt, dass jeder Prozess unter den gleichen Bedingungen stehts zum gleichen Ergebnis führt. Daher tauchen Rohstoffe nicht auf, sie entstehen als Resultat einer Kette von Prozessen. Das ist Kausalität. Die Kausalität bestimmt alles in diesem Universum, daher macht es das Universum vorhersehbar. Was uns als Zufall erscheint, ist meist nur auf unzureichendes Wissen über die Ausgangslage zurückzuführen, weshalb es nur subjektiv zufällig ist.\nDa unser komplettes Wirtschaftssystem nichts anderes macht, als Bedarf und Nachfrage gegeneinander aufzuwiegen(daher entstehen Preise) und sowohl das Angebot(wie oben beschrieben) als auch die Nachfrage(Menge an Menschen mit ausreichend finanziellen Mitteln) nicht wild zufällig variieren, kann man sehr genaue Prognosen treffen, also vorhersagen was passieren wird.\n\n\nIch  habe nichts verallgemeinert, ich habe dir erklärt was Sache ist, während ich permanent deinen BS richtigstellen musste, da dein gesamtes Wissen offensichtlich aus deinem eigenen Hinterteil stammt.\nDer Klimawandel(diesmal die richtige Richtung) ist auf die Wirtschaft angewiesen, diese wiederum auf Unternehmen und die Regeln nach denen der Kapitalismus funktioniert. Irgendetwas davon seperat zu betrachten ist schlicht weg dumm. Ein Haus baut man schließlich auch nicht nur mit dem Dach, ohne dass man sich der Mauern annimmt. Und Hitler war dein dummer Versuch einen Vergleich anzustellen, den du selber nicht verstanden hast.\n\n\nDu hast die Theorie bei den schwarzen Löchern nicht kapiert. Ich sagte \"nicht genau\", weil es zwar stimmt, dass die Physik die wir kennen und im Alltag verwenden dort nicht funktioniert, aber die Physik selbst sagt auch, dass es sich  stehts um die GLEICHEN AUSGANGSBEDINGUNGEN(erwähnte ich bereits mehrere male) handeln muss. Was an einem EINDIMENSIONALEN Raum ist den bitte mit unserem DREIdimensionalen System vergleichbar??\n\n\nDeine schrecklichen Versuche an Slang und Wortspielen werde ich zu deinen Gunsten mal ignorieren.\n\n\nUnd Physik und physikalische Gesetze sind schlicht zwei gleichartig verwendbare Begriffe, zumal ich im Englischen lediglich ein s am Ende vergessen hatte, das hat weder an der Richtigkeit der Aussage, noch an der Information selbst etwas geändert. Ich wollte lediglich zugeben, dass ich mich im genauen sprachlichen Ausdruck geirrt hatte und meinen Fehler zugeben, etwas dass du von Anfang an nicht konntest, und dass obwohl nicht ein einziges deiner lahmen Argumente standhalten konnte.\n\n\nUnd ich beleidige auf eher interlektuellem Niveau, falls das nicht aufgefallen ist. Ich sprach dir jegliche Intelligenz ab und zog sogar deine Existenz ins lächerliche, du Sauerstoffverschwendung, recht viel fieser kanns nicht werden.

Companies didn't arise from a need, they arised because of the power of advertising, because of profit.

Until the industrial age came along and put a price tag on EVERYTHING, advertised things we never saw before, things we never needed before. And if you reject that, you reject society, and since industrialism, society is built on capitalism from the ground up. If everyone shift their focus on veganism, can you really trust that a company is actually getting their vegan products in an environmentally and humane way? LOL no, blind faith like that doesn't work under capitalism. You HAVE to create regulations, YOU HAVE TO monitor companies and prevent them from doing practices that harm our planet. And you even have to straight up ban certain products, ban expansions and absolutely fucking ban practices that make the industry a monopoly. Same company that sell you your fancy vegan eco friendly salad can be selling a shit ton of meat under the guise of another name and you would be supporting them too, thats how monopoly works. Thats how most brands in America work. You gotta change yourself of course, but theres ALWAYS gonna be those that don't , you can't be a fucking jehovas witness and try to convert them, you gotta vote for people that FORCE companies to change.
