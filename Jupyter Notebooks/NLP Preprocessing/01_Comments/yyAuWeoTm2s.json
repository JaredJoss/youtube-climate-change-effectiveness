You people who spew this sort of fake science, this propaganda, should be extremely ashamed of yourselves. If you had 1 ounce of integrity you wouldn’t do this. You know full well that humans are not causing global warming. Why don’t you try looking at some of the charts of the temperatures of the earth that have actually been recorded in the past century? If you were a lawyer, you would be disbarred. You’re spewing a pile of crap to uninformed people who don’t know anything about science and have never even thought of looking at the raw data on charts from NOAA or NASA or any other organization that keeps records of temperatures. These organizations routinely lie about what they are finding and actually mess with their data so that it will say what they want it to say. For those of you who might want to check it out, look at the raw data, not add the fake manipulated data. An excellent source of actual true climate information is Tony Heller.

Flood damage would be more common due to increased pressure on drainage systems. Increased aridity on more Southern coastlines would be expected.\n\nWeaker circulation may slow down the hitherto very rapid loss of polar sea ice and surface water heating, but the blue water summer surface ocean warming combined with warmer air spilling off the North coast of Asia would likely continue the process of strengthening the Arctic warming feedback.\n\nThe medieval cooling trend could be correlated with the slow forcing effect of the Earths orbital cycles moving towards a tipping point into a new glacial maximum, although that appears to have been decisively overwhelmed by anthropogenic emissions.\n\nThe Younger Dryas event (end of last “ice age”) occurred against a backdrop of low global ocean temperature, and in particular extensive volumes of land ice.

{"cid": "UgyiIEhgaPH4yNSBepl4AaABAg", "text": "Maybe you should have looked a little further back than just to the 12th century, like the ice ages of the last 450k years, then you would have found that our \"unnatural\" \"man-made\" climate change is pretty normal. 400k years, ago, 320k years ago, 230k years ago and finally 120k years ago the climate reached exactly the point we are on at the moment, followed by a warmth period between 5000 and 25000 years that were warmer on average between 3 and 6 degrees than what we are at right now. SO seemingly we have lived back then as well, because if there is no other explanation than man-made climate change today, somehow you have to explain those warmth periods as well. And obviously, it can be 3°-6° warmer over a period of roughly 20.000 years without the earth exploding or all land being subdued in water. Also, the period of 3°-6° colder temperatures than today, the so-called ice age, took about 80k years, while the earth warmed up gradually over the course of the last 20k years to today´s values, and this is just average as well. We would expect the temperatures to rise another 3° to 6° and stay like this for between 5000 and 25000 years, even if there were no human race at all.\n\nSo yes, the climate is changing, it always did and maybe we do speed it up a little, but we couldn't keep the earth from warming another 3-6° even if we tried because that´s simply what is happening in a pretty normal 80k - 120k year cycle.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Shato Nyruami", "channel": "UCPfvObHkButv7FjyHteWVBg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTUKPH4lju37-ApXMjJKwplS6C5ICaM_FUCLcPmRA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugws2mmV1ZvYak0rNud4AaABAg", "text": "CO2 at 0.04% is a 2,500th of the atmosphere. That means to warm the climate by just 1\"C carbon dioxide molecules must capture 2500\"C of heat energy. That is bonkers. It also breaks all the laws of thermodynamics. \n\nMethane is 0.00017% of the atmosphere so its even more bonkers.\n\nHowever, the climate is changing. This is because of deliberate geoengineering programmes, in particular ozone thinning away from the poles. Though largely unreported ozone thinning effect is directly observable, this summer you will see a unnaturally bright sun just as we did last year. Under these conditions the pain felt when looking at the sun is not only from the increase in visible light but the much larger increase in infrared. (Look up at the sky and you will see a range of geoengineering operations in progress, these include chemtrail induced cloud or hazing, ripple patterns caused by HAARP installations, bizarre and unnatural cloud formations). \n\nClimate change is a programme to force change in accordance with the implementation of Agenda 21 /2030. Current events demonstrate this transition is well underway and will involve massive population cull through injected nanotech (re transhumanist programme). Agenda 21 also sees the permanent loss of all property rights with the introduction of universal basic income (ref NESARA/GESARA) and has/is being promoted by The World Economic Forum. \n\n'You will own nothing and you will be happy' WEF\n\nIn a depopulated world the surviving brainwashed and controlled population will be confined to mega cities. Carbon limits will be used to restrict consumption and liberty. Meanwhile the re-greened wilderness will be the exclusive playground of the ultra rich elite posing as conservationists. \n\nThe CO2 hoax amounts to the theft of the world and the enslavement of humanity by a parasitic few. \n\nWelcome to the future!\n\n_______\n\nI have included a debunking of 'accumulated heat' as it is so often used to explain how trace elements, so called 'greenhouse gasses', can warm the planet. \n\nAccumulated heat whilst sounding a reasonable explanation of how heat can build up is rather nothing more than gobbledygook. In fact it shows those using such arguments do not even understand what heat is. \n\nWhen we measure temperature we are measuring the heat energy a thing is losing. In short heat is a measurement of flow, the transfer of heat energy and this will always be in the direction towards the colder. For this reason a thing can never 'accumulate heat' in the way those advocating CO2 climate change describe. The temperature of a body is the measure of heat output, it can never be greater than the measure of heat input. Output = input. When a thing is warmed it is heated to an equivalent of the heat input. If this input is not maintained it will cool. Those that propose that heat can build up to be hotter than the total measure of heat input at a given time either do not understand what heat is or are being deliberately misleading. To illustrate, an object being heated by a flame can never become hotter than that flame, it's temperature cannot rise inexorably to the temperature of the sun for instance. Heat cannot be accumulated. When we think about it common sense tells us this must be the case. \n\nNASA and even Nobel Prize winning physicists have expounded 'accumulated heat' as the explanation how CO2 is able to warm the atmosphere. They claim that over hundreds of years CO2 has captured heat energy and this heat has 'accumulated' to produce a serious warming effect. As I have just explained, this is totally impossible and fundamentally violates all the laws of thermodynamics. That respected scientists should support such uneducated, unthinking nonsense is disturbing and only reflects that in terms of being able to think clearly about a subject they have no facility or inclination. These are the Dark Ages of science. Belief has outweighed logic or any critical thought. It tells us that we should not unquestioningly accept anything we are told, that experts can be fools. \n\n(NB: be aware of attempts to discard thermodynamics by talking about biology. \nEg. 'It only takes a drop of arsenic to kill a person.'\nThis would be somewhat desperate, muddled thinking. Clearly biological processes based on the reaction of a cell are not the same as the laws of physics/thermodynamics).", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Doobidoo", "channel": "UCyC0Af0-EE9uid0PaZRR0iQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQAZt03SaZXwqDp6Xho5pVQD_62KeEITfeI=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The Ice Age happened millions of years after that, not before that. Well, \"the\" Ice Age. One Ice Age, really.\nAnd these were the times when CO2 levels being several times higher than they've been the past century. I wasn't saying that CO2 levels in the past century were higher than they are today.\n\nBesides, you say that solar activity is factually not as important? Do you even know what the greenhouse effect is? It's when gases are KEEPING sunlight inside. In other words, it boils down to solar activity. Now assuming you're correct, that'd mean temperatures are steadily increasing over the year (since heat would be trapped)... yet facts show otherwise, since we've had record cold winters and all. You can bring the video again if you want, but then I'll point out that the Earth hasn't been in a constant Ice Age with higher CO2 levels. That kinda debunks that theory already, unless it's a cycle. But then... we'd either be going toward a tropical age or an ice age. We can't go for both at the same time, and the data you've been using shows a warming, not a cooling despite those record cold winters. Something simply doesn't add up.\n\nAs for the rest, I'll just say there's been fraud in order to push the global warming agenda. Check a curb of CO2 levels rising over the past 100 years. They've been rising consistently, right? Then check which year summits happened in and label those years on that graph. Yep, they didn't do ANYTHING. A far cry from how fast and efficiently they reacted to the ozone layer hole. We can talk about everything else, but if it really were an issue, they'd have done something already. Instead, for more than 50 years, they've done... close to nothing.

Really?\n\nAlso fine, if global warming doesn't mean a steady increase of temperature over the world, what exactly does it mean? Can you define it? Because unless my English is rusty, \"global\" means \"everywhere\" and \"warming\" means higher temperature. And of course, the concept is talking about a trend.

Yes, Global warming CAN influence the currents in a way which would cause certain regions in the world to experience colder weather. IT'S LITERALLY, THE BIGGEST TOPIC IN THIS VIDEO.\n\n\"Now they do say the trend is still upward, but there has yet to be (in the US for instance) massive droughts like there has been in the 1920s when millions of people died, crops burnt, animals fell dead and more. Yet temperatures in the 1970s were higher than those in the 1920s during a period of drought which saw millions of people die? Really?\"\n\nCompletely and utterly irrelevant. \n\n\"Also fine, if global warming doesn't mean a steady increase of temperature over the world, what exactly does it mean? Can you define it? \"\nYou yourself had said that the trend is upward and you still need a hand?\nWhat I meant is that it isn't, like you seem to believe, the temperatures all over the globe in every place getting slightly warmer year by year like in an oven.

Can't you have a proper discussion without blowing out in anger, insulting others? Sheesh.\n\nAnyway, I asked you to define \"global warming\" and all you told me is \"it's not as simple as you think\". That's... cool I guess? Not a definition though. If you yourself can't define it, you can make it say whatever the hell you want and it'll be correct, because you can skew the definition to encompass what you want. Just like how the definition of harrassment has changed so much that it's lost the \"repeatingly\" part of its definition and the line not to cross is now \"don't talk to me, don't look at me... unless you're handsome, then it's cool\". So you can talk once to a girl and you're sued for harrassment. It happened. So again, what's the definition of global warming?\n\nThen I tell you the global average is cooler, you say \"but it's warmer in some parts\"!! ... Okay? So when it's warmer, can I say \"but it's cooler in some parts\"? That's actually an argument you thought I made (with those record cold winters) and back then, you said \"it doesn't matter, the average is warmer\"! So which is it? You see why having a definition is important? I'm not going to dance with you when you can dictate the rules you want when you want.\n\nYou said the 1920s were getting warmer, though there were fluctuations. Indeed. So? Have I ever denied that it's getting warmer? No, in fact I even pointed out that temperatures before were below the average. Yet when you start a graph at those low temperatures, it looks like a rapid, steady rise. That's plain lying and is what the media and government love to do to push that agenda. In reality, we're entering a period of drought, be it short or long, so temperatures will be higher than the average... then after the drought, it'll be back to lower temperatures. That's how climate works, but surely you know that? Since you've been talking down to me at every turn you could about how I don't get it but you do?\n\nYou say solar irradiance is decreasing but temperature isn't. Guess what? That's not the first time in history that would've happened. Sometimes it's also much higher and doesn't fully impact temperature. There are other important things to take into consideration; despite it being the main driving force, it's not the only one. Also, depending on the source you're looking at at, solar irradiance is actually increasing. Like NASA, where we're on the upwards trend of its cycle. Huh.\n\nAnyway, I'm getting tired of your bouts of anger. I'll just say this: yes CO2 provokes rising temprature, but it's so much more than that. It also has a role as feedback on top of its role of driving climate. In other words, it both drives climate and is driven by climate.\nHowever, the scope of it all is another thing entirely. Will it be enough to have a major impact other than 2 degrees more across the globe? What about the coming Ice Age? Like you said, solar irradiation is on the decline, which would lead to an ice age with low CO2 levels. But if CO2 levels are high enough, the ice age will be avoided instead.\n\nThere's so much more, a lot of which neither you or I have any expertise on. So all that remains to be said is this: 2/3 of CO2 emissions are China alone. Their emissions have only ever increased over the past century, no summit ever changed that.

If you yourself can't define it, you can make it say whatever the hell you want and it'll be correct, because you can skew the definition to encompass what you want.\"\n\nGlobal warming is when there is a continuous many year long upward trend of the global temperature.\n\n\"Then I tell you the global average is cooler, you say \"but it's warmer in some parts\"!! ... Okay?\"\nIt is cooler, for one year, during a 50 year long upward trend.\nIt's actually me who should be saying \"Then I tell you the global average is rising, you say <<but it's a little cooler this year and there's been a few cold winters in some places>>!!... Okay?\"\n\nJust because there is 1 cooler year in a series of a dozen when it was steadily climbing doesn't mean the global warming had stopped or that those dozen warmer years didn't happen at all.\n\n\"That's actually an argument you thought I made (with those record cold winters) and back then, you said \"it doesn't matter, the average is warmer\"! So which is it?\"\nYes because that's exactly the argument you make, an anecdote about some single region having colder winters, so I gave you a counter anecdote which I'm experiencing firsthand and have been experiencing it over the past decade or so and now you're having problems with anecdotes? Apparently it's only bad when they can be used against your position, lol.\n\n\"You said the 1920s were getting warmer, though there were fluctuations. Indeed. So?\"\nSo why the fuck are you surprised that there are fluctuations NOW? THINK.\n\n\"In reality, we're entering a period of drought, be it short or long, so temperatures will be higher than the average...\"\nYeah tell that to all the people in the tropics with record amount of hurricanes. They sure are dying of draught.\nDraughts are only local, not global, unless it's some catastrophic event.\n\nFurthermore you're basing a sun irradiance caused warmer period and apply the same logic to this one which ISN'T caused by the irradiance. Will it eventually lead to a colder period? Sure it will, watch the video again. You must've watched it 5 times by now from me telling you to rewatch it and you still fail to grasp what this video is trying to explain. Cold climate will come around at some point, but it won't be pleasant for humanity leading up to that point or when the ice age comes.\n\n\"Since you've been talking down to me at every turn you could about how I don't get it but you do?\"\nI'm sorry you tried to \"get back\" at me? If you could point out the attempt for me please do because all I can see is some dude whining.\n\n \"You say solar irradiance is decreasing but temperature isn't. Guess what? That's not the first time in history that would've happened. Sometimes it's also much higher and doesn't fully impact temperature.\"\nSo why in the fuck were you even mentioning it in the first place and wasting my fucking time?\nIs that your thing you get off to? Saying completely pointless shit to waste others' time? Maybe because unless you try for this attention on the internet nobody is willing to give any to you in real life?\n\n\"Also, depending on the source you're looking at at, solar irradiance is actually increasing. Like NASA, where we're on the upwards trend of its cycle. Huh.\"\nDo me a favour and look at the last 100 years of this irradiance and then think again, if you can. Then plot on that graph global temperatures. Then think very very very hard on it, spend a week staring at it if you need to, then get back to me and apologize for being a lowly idiot.\n\n\"However, the scope of it all is another thing entirely. Will it be enough to have a major impact other than 2 degrees more across the globe? What about the coming Ice Age?\"\n\nThe Ice Age that we're actively putting back in time with our CO2 output?\nYou won't be able to experience it and neither will your kids. But hopefully some descendant of yours, if someone is unlucky enough to have your kids, that is, will be able to reach that point and survive that test for humanity as well, that's assuming we don't drive the climate off the cliff and cause another mass extinction event which will impact us greatly.\n\n\"Like you said, solar irradiation is on the decline, which would lead to an ice age with low CO2 levels.

{"cid": "UgzJY7oApkOXSSweno54AaABAg", "text": "Well there is something to precise. On earth eastern parts of high latitudes oceans are warmers than their western equivalant, it is not a feature of Europe, further, Europe looks like a huge peninsula such as Alaska and this could play also a role. But again you forgot to explain one point : what is the link between sea and air temperature? If you take the Kalahari region, it is one of the hottest and it faces a cold part of the Atlantic Ocean. The same goes for South Chili. The point is scientists are not sure that it is the gulf stream that controls the European temperature or if gulf stream and Europe temperature are both controlled by something : the easterly wind. This is probably what gives the mild European temperature, or at least contribute to it.\nIf the gulf stream stops but the easterly remains the first consequence to occur should be a drier Europe because cold ocean means less evaporation and therefore less cloud/rain. To generate a cold age you need more parameters including the sun activity and earth precession. Now, the north hemisphere is pointing at the sun (summer) when the planet is the further away from it and winter for the closest, creating mild temperatures. This is the opposite for the south hemisphere but since it does not have huge pass lands, it does not matter. However it has been shown that this orientation evolves with time and when the north hemisphere points toward the sun whilst the planet is closed to the sun, it creates light exposure and since the north has more land mass this results in extreme seasons. And when this major change coincides with other changes such as reduction of sun power or reduction of the gulf stream, extreme climate (hot summer and cold winter) turns to mild summer and cold winter in the north driving an  ice age.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Loïc Rolas", "channel": "UCfJ7CwbiEWbV4nox1BVbD6g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbIqEJlX5MXROcN9prraX8XqzPXWD7-3s2l0LWlg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Even then you probably won't actively drive into a storm to get the proper wind readings. \n\nThe sensitivity that we use to name a storm is more sensitive so more storms are named.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Ryan Thundrr", "channel": "UCDwWpcpg8mKcVoGO3VBnogw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRggR8HJEm6D6QE0BqwW-TKmNAnOq8CuV1AGQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz34Cz-F3n_C35AEy14AaABAg", "text": "Scientific theories have never been established by consensus. Science is validated by comparing observations or experiments with theories. If the facts agree with the theory, confidence in the theory grows. If the facts contradict the theory, the theory is abandoned or modified and retested. Again and again, key predictions of alarming climate models have disagreed with observations and have greatly exaggerated supposedly harmful effects from more CO2.\r\n\r\nCO2 is not a pollutant\r\n'To suddenly label CO2 as a \"pollutant\" is a disservice to a gas that has played an enormous role in the development and sustainability of all life on this wonderful Earth. Mother Earth has clearly ruled that CO2 is not a pollutant.' (Robert Balling, as quoted by Popular Technology). As measured from space, the whole earth is getting greener as a result of Carbon Dioxide. CO2 is increasing agricultural yields, it is increasing the forest, it is increasing the growth in the biological world and that’s important and more certain then the effects on climate which is almost nonexistent.\r\nClimate changes because of circulation patterns caused by Solar activity ( changes in irradiance, Magnet Field, absorption in the stratosphere, Cosmic rays modulation) and the stages of the moon. The earth rotating around the sun in a elliptical pattern has multiple fluctuations and variances on the years since its existence. The earths elliptical pattern causes the earth to get closer to the sun (80 million  miles) and farther away from the sun (116 million miles). The earth spins (wobbling a 26,000 year cycle between Polaris and Vega) around the sun at a tilt (varies from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees) which is not constant and varies over time. This tilt also effects earth's climate. (Milankovitch Theory). Man does not have the ability to change circulation patterns. Temperatures changes has nothing to do with CO2. You can not control CO2 (you breath out CO2 (40,000 ppm) plant food). CO2 can never be a air pollutant ( 2 USA supreme court judges) The weather Climate system is powered by solar energy. The Total solar irradiance (W/m2) (temperature) data matches very well with Northern Hemisphere temperatures. Compare Total solar irradiance (W/m2) vs Total Water Vapour matching very good. \r\nClimate has being changing for 4.5 billion years. Climate change is nothing that you have to prove, it is always changing. Making Climate change into something that is alarming, which governments are doing is weird and irresponsible and devious. The questions to ask is what is a normal climate on this earth? What should be the normal average mean Temperature on this planet? The average temperature on the suns surface is about 6,000 degrees Celsius and the suns core temperature is 17 million degrees Celsius. The temperature on earth during the Maunder Minimum and the irradiance will decrease by 0.3%. The average Temperatures in England will decrease by 0.8 degrees Celsius. This could last for 11 years of lower temperatures that will result in world wide poor food productivity which cause lead to food shortages and the problems that goes with it. (Valentina Zharkova Sun EXPERT)\r\nProfessor Valentina Zharkova predicts the modern Grand Minimum to occur from 2020 to 2055\r\n(In 2019 snow on July 7,12 and 14 in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania & Hungary first time in 150 years. In North America cooler and wetter weather have caused poor crop yields and problem getting crops off the fields. Then there was about 1 meter high hail stones falling in Mexico. Biologists from Greece & meteorologist from Finland have noticed that vegetation/bushes/trees are one month late, nature starting to feel the effects of the solar Magnetic field is decreasing.)\r\nTemperatures will be dropping that may have food shortages (both for animals & humans) starting 2028 to 2032. The world only has the capability to feed the planet for 60 days before we need to grow more food.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difference between weather and climate is a measure of time. Weather is  what conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere \"behaves\" over relatively long periods of time.\r\n Carbon Dioxide absorption is logarithmic NOT Linear. CO2 will only absorb radiation at a certain wavelength 15 micron.\r\nGreenhouse gas system:\r\n95% is water vapour\r\n3.6% is Carbon Dioxide which consists of \r\nNatural occurring CO2 is 3.48%\r\nMan made CO2 is 0.12%\r\nCanada produces only 1.6% of the world's CO2 emissions.\r\nThe atmosphere consist of 0.040%\r\nWater Vapour (which causes 95% of greenhouse warming has not increased)\r\nSince the 1950, CO2 increased by 0.008% (during the warming period 1980 to 2000 not enough to cause any significant warming)\r\nCarbon Dioxide has no significant effect on global temperature.\r\nCutting Carbon Dioxide emissions will not change atmospheric CO2.\r\nCO2 always lags global warming so it can NOT be the cause of Global warming.\r\nThere is NO correlation between CO2 and temperature increases.\r\nMany hundreds / thousands of global warming events have occurred over geological past BEFORE the rise of CO2 and thus could NOT be cause by CO2.\r\nOnly 0.1% of the global warming period correlates with increased CO2.\r\nWe burn 30 billion tons per year of CO2 world wide that is equal to 2 ppm/year in the atmosphere that gives us 15 billion tons per ppm per (30/2=15).  The UN claims in about 2011 that we will increase the CO2 in the atmosphere, by 468 ppm in the next century, if we do not do something about it. The UN thinks we are going to get (15 × 468)= 7.020 trillion tons of CO2 which will increase the temperature by 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the nex olar and Wind are very heavily subsidized (500 times) much more then Oil & Gas.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "R Sch", "channel": "UCxYDeUS1X_KCWKgv4xmGQMw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRtZI5C5VaPtg5FHehIKNW2v1w7yk_CLFSS3w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Thermohaline circulation relies on this density, as water falling down from the surface pushes the other water out of the way, starting the circulation.  All fine.

{"cid": "Ugz7g-i54tJj2tKC9Ax4AaABAg", "text": "This video presents extremely poor quality, incorrect science, because 82% of the heat that Madrid Spain gets and that NYC New York USA doesn't get is just warm southwest prevailing winds blowing from the Gulf of Mexico northeast to Spain (to Europe, Scandanavia & the British Isles) and this 82% is only affected by 30% by a COMPLETE SHUT DOWN of the thermohaline circulation (THC) because the other 70% of the water circulating is caused by the wind-driven North Atlantic Ocean clockwise gyre which is just driven by the southwest prevailing wind and goes around in a clockwise circle covering the North Atlantic Ocean and has NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH the thermohaline circulation. So, if the THC was to shut down completely then Madrid Spain's extra warmth would be reduced by just 30% of  82% = 24% so the 11 degrees warmer of Madrid Spain would be reduced by  24% which is 2.6 degrees less, leaving Madrid Spain still 8-9 degrees warmer than NYC New York USA. Now, is NYC New York USA presently in the grip of an ice age ? Are there presently sheets of ice a few thousand feet thick covering NYC New York USA ? I think not. Therefore, why one Earth would Madrid Spain get covered in sheets of ice just because its only 8-9 degrees warmer than NYC New York USA ? It wouldn't. Climate scientists have studied this (duh, of course, dug, you shit pile of babbling fuckwits) and concluded that London gets ~2.0 degrees colder in winter (still getting warmer in summer) if the thermohaline circulation stops, Scotland ~3.5 degrees colder in winter and poor old Scandanavia bites the bullet with ~6.0 degrees colder in winter. No ice sheets anywhere there, no ice ages anywhere there, ever-warmer summers everywhere there from the relentless global warming that humans are causing.

The last ~1,000,000 years though CO2 got so low at 280 ppmv that obliquity (tilt) by itself wasn't enough to pull the northern hemisphere completely out of a glaciation period so it needed both precession and the 100,000 / 400,000 year orbital ellipticity cycles to give it that final push of warming at latitude 65N so that's why the cycle length increased ~1,000,000 years ago from the old 40,000-year tilt \"mini glaciation\" cycles of a few million years ago to the recent (last ~1,000,000 years) ~110,000-year \"full glaciation\" cycles with the 3 of ~26,000-year partial de-glaciation (ice sheets retreated a huge amount and then advanced again) that you clearly see in the Greenland ice core proxy surface temperature analysis plot.

First off, it has been well established, and even agreed to by the UN scientists that the carbon dioxide percentage in the atmosphere is around 0.4%, and of that 0.4% carbon dioxide, humans produce approximately 3% while the other 97% is produced by nature. Everyone believes that plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen through a process called photosynthesis, and yes, that is true during the daytime, but at night the exact opposite happens. Plants around the world take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide through a process called respiration. Humans are not the only, or even the largest producers of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, in fact, we only provide a very small portion of it.\n\nSecondly, the main factor that leads to cyclic heating and cooling of the Earth is not carbon dioxide, ocean salinity, or any other factor here on Earth, it is the Sun, and solar cycles, which the UN scientists are just not finally realizing.

But the Earths orbit around the sun and the suns fluctuating energy output could and most likely will cause the earth to cool rapidly sooner or later.\nThe sun is not a constant and neither is our orbit around it. Combine the 2 and you get hotter and cooler periods. The actual cause of global warming. Yes Yes particulates and gasses do effect global warming and are contributors to retaining the heat effectively being an insulator and yes the evidence suggests water density is a large contributing factor. But the heat is coming from the sun and our molten iron core. \nCheck out the new data regarding magnetic fields interacting between the sun and the earth and look at how the suns induction effect heats our iron core. Add that to your model and see how that effects the predicted outcomes.\nWe have a chilly period coming no doubt and humans will have no control over that. Even if we clean up all the mess from the industrial revolution (something we should be doing anyway) and plant billions of trees to re hydrate the earths surface and force rain fall into the aquafers it will only decrease the effect of the change. We cannot stop it happening.\nYou show me how to control a massive nuclear reaction that has been burning for well over 4 billion years and I will show you how to stop global warming. Until then just plan for the worst and hope for the best. just like humans have been doing since we became humans as we know them today. We are not Gods we cannot control the forces of the universe on a solar system wide scale. At best we can predict outcomes and plan ahead. \nThe fact of the matter is that humans are not that powerful and even with all our combined knowledge and technical skills we still do not understand how even the most basic functions of our own solar system can be altered by us in any significant way.

No, there is no possible chance that humans have zilch to do with the climate, that the planet's climate is on a fast track to destruction due to our behavior. These are all just hypothesis, which are not proven to date. The only thing that is proven, based on our global pollution, is that we can seriously eff up an ecosystem, and it's entirety of all life that lives within said ecosystem. other than that, the rest is merely speculation driven so hard down our throats, you would think that humans in general are the deadliest poison on this planet. \nMy original comment was a mildly laughable comparison to how our daily weather forecasting is. We literally have dozens of weather models that will all tell a complete different story for the same place and time. Therefore making my comment true, for weather.

Its called the Pleistocene, and it is still going strong.  In fact, the next glaciation cycle is about to repeat itself again, in the very near future.  We are currently in an Inter-glacial, known as the Holocene.  \nWhat you are referring to is the repeating glaciation phases that have repeated themselves about every 110,000 years.  If you look back at the past several hundred years, the last Grand Solar Minimum(little ice age) was 440 years ago, called the Maunder Minimum.  \nI don't know why this is all so hard for science to work through.  As a physical anthropologist, I have known all this since the mid-70s, as a graduate student.  \n1. We are in an ice age - Pleistocene\n2.We are currently in an inter-glacial - Holocene\n3.

The Earth in 2023 will begin a weather pattern that will by 2027 result in massive destruction of our environment worldwide as the Earth starts an evolutionary spin into the death of our planet. We'll have a few years to stop this from happening. In 2024 if we don't change our ways it will probably be too late to save our environment from the destruction that we caused!

{"cid": "Ugx7W7YE1csUrHTh-cJ4AaABAg", "text": "You lost all credibility when you claimed humans are responsible for global warming. Humans are as responsible for gloval warming as ants and spiders are responsible for warming your basement. \nOne Volcanic eruption teleases more \"greenhouse\" gasses than man has in the last 5,000 years.\nGloval warming and cooling are a natural event/cycle. Human activity has less than zero effect on the cycle.\nIn answer to your question \"can global warming lead to a new iceage?\" The answer is \"yes\".\nThe evidence so far indicates there was a period of global warming just prior to every iceage. Considering the fact tbat humans and industrialization were not around prior to any of the ice ages (there has been more than one) kinda shoots holes in the \"humans are responsible\" bull shit.\nPrior to the 1700's and long before \"the industrial revolution\", people were ice scating on the Thames River until it stopped freezing over in the late 1700's/early 1800's, again, long before the industrial revolution.\nGlobal Warming is \"old news\", its been happeninh for hundreds of years.\nWhen (not \"if\") the Gulf Stream stops or slows enough, there will be another iceage, which will last until the Gulf Stream starts flowing again. Just like every iceage before.\nShore lines will receed, not raise. Who knows? Maybe Florida and Cuba will be connected by dry land again, and the Mediterranean Sea will once again be cut off from the Atlantic, and evaporate to the point it no longer exists again. Sea Levels will drop enough the English Channel will be dry, connecting Britian to France.\nAlaska and Russia will again have a \"land bridge\" connecting them. 😷 \nWill the shorelines be tbe same after the next iceage? Who inows? I don't. I kinda doubt they will be. The San Andreas Fault may finally have \"The Big One\" during tbe iceage, and California might be an island or sea bottom as far inland as Nevada and Utah, to the east, and Oregon to the north, when the new iceage is over.

As for what you have been told by the media.  They are nothing more than propaganda.  There is no such thing as \"settled science\".  Science is the process of observation, and then making predictions and then seeing is those predictions come to pass.  If they don't then your theory is flawed.  EVERY climate model that has been used for predictions so far has been wildly inaccurate.   In real science when your predictions of what your theory should have happen don't happen, then your theory is seen as wrong and garbage.   Any fool that actually thinks C02 is a pollutant and that 400 part per million of C02 is a bad thing, then they have no understanding of the historical past of C02  in the atmosphere.  at 400 parts per million we are still at a very low level compared to the earths past.  The carbon in coal and oil, did not start in the coal and the oil.  It was once in the atmosphere.

This is in light of exactly what you are describing here, but on a smaller than global scale. I traveled in august 2003 to southern Germany near Lake Constance, or Bodensee as the Germans refer to it. Like you mentioned, I packed light, especially as the news from France a week before I traveled was of old people dying from an especially warm August. Was I surprised to find I was ill equipped for the weather  during my week in Friedrichshaven. While layering my sweater and windbreaker worked for the dry days as a spectator/course marshal for a bicycle sporting event held there in conjunction with a Grand Bicycle  Dealers show at the Messe(Convention center).  When it rained I was shivering and wet as if it were October. Pack a jacket, I would advise. Returning I looked up the reasons for the great disparity in the two week period, and I remember that there was a short shift in the gulf stream that caused that wild swing in temperature.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Paul Gracey", "channel": "UCj0G4MBRpkp-LKNK-2hYarg", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTzxaDOA96xKIndDhC0G-yGQB1BzqXImf9QKnIJ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As the sun light was blocked and temperatures plummet, it cause a large advance of ice.  There was not a disruption in the oceanic convection as claimed here.  The cause was clearly not how warm the temperatures were preceding the climate change.  This video is misleading and seems to support the theory that industrialization and global warming will cause an ice age.  Though there could be some truth provided the oceanic convection is disrupted, it still may not reverse the parts per million of Co2 in the air to plummet the planet into a major ice age if we keep pumping these gases into the atmosphere.  Climate is more on the geologic timeline than this video would have you believe.  It is more likely the rest of human history will know this warm period to our extinction.

{"cid": "UgxyJBPSCSrR6BFLU-d4AaABAg", "text": "For thinking people; ah, the great debate on climate change. \n\nOne way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it.  I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major taking one side or  the other.  \n\nWhat I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn't support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is supportive, while anything  post that would support the argument stays.  Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...\n\nFrom NASA:  Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the ice age would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional “blips” every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth's orbit—eccentricity, obliquity, and —affect global climate. But it's a lot more complicated than that.  \n\nAnd, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn't do so well because it's hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis.  Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100's of millions of years.\n\nSo, I totally believe in climate change... It's been going on for 100's of millions of years, since planet formation.  Long before humans arrived;  and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.\n\n\n\nAnd, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. \n\nI'll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.\n\nIt's pretty easy to get the impression that the narrative is being used as a political tool to try and get vast groups of people behind yet another 'crisis', then steer them to support a politician who puts himself up as a though-leader on the subject.

{"cid": "UgybcX57mdxVLYdntrt4AaABAg", "text": "It is Climate Change, not global warming and since the beginning of time the earth warms and cools! Ice cores prove that the earth was 2 degrees celsius warmer than is is today. In 1975-1979 the news all was worried about global cooling. Look it up. Humans are nothing but a fart in the wind. There are also weather temperatures graphs where you can do your own analysis. Run a 30 year temperature change for your zip code or area code and you can see the ups and downs. Screen shot that, then go back another 30 years, screen shot and repeat. Overlay those and you will see the ups and downs of weather over time. In addition, if Climate change were real, why don’t insurance companies require Miami building developments to have climate change insurance packages for water level rises? Because climate change is a lie! Talk to the scientists at the south pole about ice cores. Bullshit narrative. The truth as much as science has advanced we still don’t know everything about how the earth works. Climate change is a bullshit narrative and a lie. We are nothing but a fart in the wind in the cosmos of time. Leave my taxes alone and stay out of my pocket. Start focusing on getting term limits for the house and congress representatives. Also, let’s eliminate the ability for lobbyists to lobby the house and senate members. If you want change, that is how you make change! Stop lying about climate change to increase our taxes! It’s a lie! They don’t have all the data and as scientists we’re still unaware of how the world works. It’s a hypothesis and in any hypothesis it’s subject to bias. Also, correlation does not equal causation. All this talk on this video say “could”. Well, I could die tomorrow. Doesn’t mean it’s going to happen.

With higher CO2 in the atmosphere, the ocean becomes more acidic, and with higher temperatures less oxygen rich. More CO2 can be held in water than is needed to become toxic to living things, let alone too acidic for exoskeletons of zooplankton to be built, so we don’t need to bother with CO2’s saturation since everything would be long asphyxiated before then. I should also say that the surface is where the depths get all their oxygen from. The depths will be slowly but surely asphyxiated.\n\nNutrient flow would also be impacted. Without the waterfall system, the deep sea weakens in its ability to support life due to low trace minerals. This mixing helps drive oceanic life beyond thermal vents at the sea floor. The twilight zone becomes much more isolated from the surface zone since the warm surface water mixes less with the cooler deep water, with species that require journeying between the depths and surface for food by night getting whittled down in numbers due to less food, temperature shock, anoxia, and acidification. Eventually, marine snow volumes decrease, making the midnight and abyssal depth detrivores (those who eat dead animal and plant matter) eventually begin to starve too, causing their predators to also starve. Without the stable surface, the oceans cease to be the bustling place of life we know them to be.\n\nThe poles’ cooling and subsequent cooling over northern Europe doesn’t do enough to fully stop the greenhouse effect either. If anything, the effects wouldn’t have time to take hold as the climate keeps warming in a feedback loop from already existent ice loss. At most, the ice we have might be holding on for dear life for an additional few years before greenhouse gases caught up again. It couldn’t do much for long enough or fast enough to not still see widespread damage from warmer winters, since it takes centuries or millennia to grow enough permanent ice to combat our current level of warming.\n\nDespite the ice holding on for just a little longer, we still have a much hotter equator anyway, levelling out the would be “benefits” of the cooler north even further. The temperate subtropics might have a lovely stable climate for a short while, less perturbed by seasonal variances (which many species rely on), but would see worse offshoots of freak weather from all that ocean evaporation in the tropics and drier cool air in the north and south. The evaporation wouldn’t do enough for cloud coverage, either. Clouds only last so long, only do so much for our albedo, and storms tend to wreck natural sources of greenhouse gas absorption anyway. The one positive thing from all the clouds would be the subsequent storms’ lightning making a tiny amount of extra ozone, as we’d really want it with all the heating going on.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Gui Smith", "channel": "UCgSwtc_1p316Y2QbHb1SWow", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTDCspYDb0eIbbUwiaFfrrqsXIr0ECkWAyZbjaAXQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Early Dinosaurs were also adapted to the harsh conditions after the Permian mass extinction event (rise in global temperature by ca. 10°C).

CO2 causes what? cooling or warming? cant have it both ways! However 'Climate Change' is the natural state, it has always changed that is the nature of climate (and weather). So climate change is the cooling and is the warming it cant do both together! Unless you are a climate prophet claiming an all winning argument. Look at the Holocene history and we will see massive warming as we are STILL coming out of an Ice Age and in a warm period. Yes humans have a slight impact on the CO2 'environment' however seemingly too small to be the 'absolute cause' of proposed climate change figures. Predictions are fruitless as they have always been proven to be inaccurate over the past 100 years (every 30 years we get a it's warming, it's cooling,  it's warming). Sea level will rise as it has done for the past 300 years at a rate of 1cm \n\nWhich way does anyone what to 'believe' it is going? And who says some warming or even cooling is 'bad' evident science proves that life thrives in high levels of CO2 and the current CO2 levels are greening the planet and helping increased crop yields to provide food for this overpopulated planet we live in. All plant life dies at levels below CO2 182ppm so this means life extinct for all life. Yes tackle the emissions however we have more toxic emissions to deal with over CO2 which is a life bringer not a life taker (from past CO2 levels and evidential life). But if we listen to the 8.5 degree statements from some 'modelled' (expensive crystal balls) observations are simply not following that, they are following the lowest of .09 degrees n 100 years at the moment. And as for sea level rise! Do the research and look to non homogenised data and historic scientific news back to 1850s for the actual results of own research.\nI sit on the fence with a 'we are in a warming period' as I simply do not know, neither does anyone else if they cleared subjective belief/disbelief, however am sceptical in 'group think' as history has made those who joined together and prophesied anything as being the source of tomorrows humour. \nHuman arguments with reality are: we must maintain the ice,  species should not go extinct, the climate should be this way, warming is 'bad', cooling is 'bad', Humans are 'bad' and humans are not a natural part of the biosystem.

Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nFrom global warming or climate change there is going to be mass extinctions of humans and wildlife, we do not know when, but from pollution also we are going to face mass extinction.\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things which are not required as a necessity for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.\nWhat about the companies that are going to be shut down. They would have debts to pay, just excuse them.\nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \n\n2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, noodles, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. Humans have to do this before it is too late.\n\nIf this is done, then many jobs would be lost. For that many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own.\nIs their any another solution, that humans won't lose jobs and also planet earth will be saved.\nIndustrial jobs or planet earth, which should we save, planet earth is more important. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans after 100 or 200 years.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

More CO2 means the stomates of the plant leaves  are not opened as wide because there is more CO2 in the atmosphere, smaller stomates means less water loss, so now plants are growing in dryer area, where plants could not grow before the area being too arid.

From my educational knowledge and research I have done, I can tell you three reasons why the Sahara was expanding: reason one: we are in a cold period, and when the climate is colder, the weather is dryer, deserts 🏜expand. Second reason: do you know about continental drift? Well the Sahara region of Africa is moving Northward, which means that where the Sahara used to be more south, at the equator where the climate is wetter because of the zenith of the sun (I learned this in my climatology classes when completing my degree), it rains along the equator as air rises the most there and loses its humidity, but when is comes back down to earth north and south of the equator, the air is already bone dry and so regions just North and South of the equator are arid, where lies the Sahara desert today, as all the deserts are located in the tropic regions of the earth. \nFinally the third reason for the Sahara expanding are all the grazing from 🐐 GOATS, mostly North is the Sahara. GOATS shave all of the vegetation, all of it!!!! This causes desertification! All these statements are back up by research, findings, data, stats and facts. If you don’t believe it, research it- you will be surprised.\nThe Sahara was a equatorial Forrest at some point when located at the equator, but now located North of the equator, it turned into a desert.

Our coldest temperature on record was -39 F in 1899.  \n\nIt is difficult from my perspective to see an ice age occurring when here literally for the past 10 years it’s been the warmest winters on record here.

Hey, I like many would like to be able to break it all down as we can find a massive amount of videos with that being the objective content. As much as I watch with great interest in the search for truth among many, many others who do the same, although no expert here is some analyzing of my own I have come up with in my quest for truth! To be quite honest, I'm not sold on all this climate change / global green stuff, or at least as it has been promoted or presented. Unfortunately, too much diversive rationale has been mixed into the equation! Either way the \"catastrophic consequences\" that we should be even more concerned about is the massive change in \"global governmental structures\" that such persuasive assumptions has forcefully imposed upon our world, drastically erasing the true meaning of Independence and freedom that is intended to be known. Such propaganda has been so widely accepted now that people have naively become condition to believe anything that sounds supposedly factual, accepting information mixed with diversive assumptions (deception) on the basis of fear. Thus, separating the truth from lies has now become next to impossible for many, many people. As such deceptive conditioning has now been so widely accepted, the world is now prepared to be ushered into the final stages (as sheep that have been led to the slaughter) of this anti-Christ, \"New World Order\" entrapment which will ensure it's victims of no way to escape. By the way, have folks not considered the likelihood of the so called \"climate change\" actually being one of the many facets of God's wrath in the present tense (Rom 1:18; Eph 5:6)? Scripture makes it clear that God's wrath is not exclusively reserved for end times eschatology events! John 3:36 tells us that : \"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath \"REMAINS\" on them. As it is not God's will for any to perish (2 Pet 3:9), He will do things accordingly to \"frustrate the ways of the wicked\" (Ps 146:9) that whosoever will might come to repentance by accepting redemption (1 Pet 3:18) and avoid the fate of all \"Christ rejectors!\" SEE Matt 25:46. If you are one of the few who can tolerate literal truth as opposed to propaganda, watch these two presentations as your future will depend upon it! >>> ttps://youtu.be/lI3sXC9jhCY and, https://youtu.be/sluNuVp2_TE.

Its going to come even if we try to stop it mainly due to how Earths orbit works and how the sun heats our planet.  Before the sun goes out the Earth will experience another Ice Age due to Earths tilt and position. \n\nIts along way off though giving enough time to recreate forests/jungles like the amazon rain forest...  which we need more of.

Is it warmer now than 120 years ago? - and Are we causing it? The first answer is yes and is easy to prove. But if you ask the same question with a different point in time, the answer will be different. Is it warmer than 90 years ago? Definitely no and it is just as easy to prove. In the 1930s there were heat waves in the northern hemisphere that were much more severe than today. Your second question, are we causing it  - requires that we agree on the first question. If you compare 1970-1980 to 1950-1960  then it is verifyably false. There is a famous song by Rudi Carell in which he laments that the summers of the 70s are so cold. And he braggs about the summers of his childhood in the 50s which were warm and sunny all through the summer. Please check this yourself if you are a critical thinker.  I hope you understand that a question like the one you posed is not as easy to answer. Also please check, if you can, that the warming from 1990-2000 is over now. Right now we are in a proces of steady cooling. The freezing temperatures in May are an indication but not a solid proof for that. But the cooling of the atlantic ocean is a verifyable process. You can observe this yourself if you accept that the reduced rain and the drying of the country in europe is due to less ocean water evaporation. I guess you will immediately agree that the last 3 summers are dryer than before but you draw the false conclusion. A warm ocean evaporates more water and brings more rain - not a cold ocean! So if you put aside all your prejudices and use meterological knowledge, you will understand climate a little better and maybe you also recognize that much of what they tell you is sheer nonsense.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Max Tabmann", "channel": "UCpgJ2pPUrxklN3-TvAXZjaA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT09q7Mrc8HeiRs_qkYEPhQgB_zLn4va8zfKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Earth even warmed 0.6°F in the 2010s alone. \nEarths has been warming since the seventies and will keep on warming. And a song means nothing about climate. \n\nAlso yes it’s been a chilly May, that’s because of the jet stream. As the arctic warms the jet stream slows down and becomes wavy. This cause extreme weather patterns. Like the extreme heat we saw out west this weekend and snow we see this weekend in the Northeast. Also weathers not climate and many northeastern cities are still on track for top 5 hottest years on record. \nAlso idk what you mean by “dry summers” because here in the United States, we have been seeing record wet years. Lots of flooding and rain. And the oceans are warming too.

After playing this for a week, you may realize that these questions cannot be satisfactorily decided by just citing public data. You need something more, like e.g. knowledge about the climate phases through the last holocene. This helps to check statements made in these publications, on correctness. Also detected contradictions tell you that something is wrong. Your GISS curve has a number of weaknesses. First, it starts with end of the little ice age (LIA), as do many sources that want to misslead. Of course, after the LIA, all temperatures are warmer, but do you know how warm it was before the LIA? Probably not! Then it shows no absolute temperatures - only anomalies. The second problem is the 1930s. The GISS curve is flat here, but this is a period, where newspapers already existed. An these newspapers from USA, to Europe and to Australia tell you that it was the hottest phase in the 20th century. Strange, GISS has flattened that. Why? Then we had a warming pause after the year 2000. Many independent institutions confirmed that. There were even articles on \"the pause\", asking, did the warming stop or is this just a temporary phenomenon. You GISS curve is in stark contradiction to previous publications, even by the IPCC.

If thats true, then every discussion with you is a waste of time. If you have a backgroud of experience with natural phenomena and a little bit of logic capablities, then a discussion may be worthwhile. Your comment, that warmer oceans may not increase evaporation is a first indication that your logic is quite restricted. Or if you mean, it does not increase precipitation, this shows another bias. You focus on rare spots like death valley or the atacama desert, while we discuss global effects. \n\nSo as a simple start, do you have any OWN evidence that warming has increased? Did the evaporation increase globally? You may note that you will have to find statistical records that have not yet been altered by climate activists. Did the precipitation increase worldwide? Did the desert areas get smaller? Probably you think, that with rising temperatures deserts should increase, but for this, look at the deserts 8000 years ago, they were green and filled with lakes.

Remember, when CO2 is high during an interglacial the world cools, and when CO2 is low at the glacial maximum, the world warms. Yes - counterintuitive, isn’t it... \n\n\n\nSo what controls and modulates the interglacial cycle? Answer - orbital cycles and ice sheet albedo. \n\nMilankovitch orbital cycles provide the basis, but the surface feedback mechanism is albedo, not CO2. The albedo effect as measured in the high NH latitudes is orders of magnitude greater that any CO2 effects. Ice ages would continue indefinitely, if the high albedo of the ice-sheets could not be lowered. \n\n\n\nSo what lowers ice sheet albedo? Answer - dust. \n\n It is a fact that sudden dust-storms lasting for millennia, lower the ice sheet albedo just before every interglacial. Why these dust-storms suddenly happen, is fully explained in the science paper: Ice Age Modulation by Dust and Albedo.

Its again because the whole Asian continent cools off in winter and the air goes from West to East and when it reaches Eastern Siberia is at its coldest.\nSimilarly in summer, because the USA warms up, the East part of the USA is warmer than the Western USA.\nThere is a warm current similar to Gulfstream called Kuroshio on the coast of china and Japan that should make China and Japan mild and they are not.

A  period of mountain-building was also underway (the so-called Taconic orogeny) increasing the amount of rock weathering taking place and subsequently lowering CO2 levels even further. The evidence is definitely there for a short-term disruption of the carbon cycle.\n\nAnother important factor is the sun. During the Ordovician, it would have been several percent dimmer according to established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Surprisingly, this raises the CO2 threshold for glaciation to a staggering 3000 ppmv or so. This also explains (along with the logarithmic forcing effect of CO2) why a runaway greenhouse didn't occur: with a dimmer sun, high CO2 is necessary to stop the Earth freezing over.\n\nIn summary, we know CO2 was probably very high coming into the Late Ordovician period, however the subsequent dip in CO2 was brief enough not to register in the GEOCARB model, yet low enough (with the help of a dimmer sun) to trigger permanent ice-formation. Effectively it was a brief excursion to coldness during an otherwise warm era, due to a coincidence of conditions.”\n\nCO2 levels dropped but very briefly. That plus a dimmer sun and Earth had ice. The issue is you guys are confusing a glaciation with a snow ball. It wasn’t a large ice age. It was some brief cooling and some brief ice sheets in a very warm period in Earths history. \n\nWe know the current warming caused by humans is definitely CO2. Us pumping tons of it into the air is acting as a greenhouse causing Earth to warm. \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/evidence.amp \n\nYou can’t just say myths to fit your, well, whatever thing your trying to prove. That fact is CO2 is a greenhouse gas. The more you put in the air the warmer Earth’s temperature gets. \n\nCurrent CO2 is at 415 ppmv. The highest 5 million years and the last time CO2 was that high, temperatures globally were 3°C warmer than today. There was no ice on Greenland then but there was ice on Antarctica. CO2 levels could be as high as 1,000 ppmv by 2100. That last time CO2 was that high was during the Palogene over 50 million years ago. During this time Earth warmed 5-8°C in 20,000 years and the peak Hearing during this time was almost 10°C hotter than today. Earth was ice free. The reason for this warm period was all because of CO2. The main cause is unknown but CO2 did warm the planet than. And the greenhouse effect is occurring. If we were to remove all the CO2 out of the air alone, Earth would be way to cold for life. But if we had too much CO2. Things will get way to Hot.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sir.

If you compare the West Coast, we see similar temperatures up to Portland and Vancouver than in Europe. Although, sure, it is on a much thinner strip. But at 3:40 you clearly show a circulation map with a cold current around the East Coast of America and a warm one on the West Coast, similar to the warm current in Europe.\nAdd to that the fact that Europe has 2 and a half inland seas (the Mediterranean, the Baltic and the North Sea that, although connected to the Arctic, is still continental crust meaning shallow waters — also keep in mind that's the case for the English Channel and the Irish Sea), then the warmer temperatures and, most importantly, warmer winters make sense. Water acts as a buffer since it takes much longer to cool down than land. That's why part of Russia that are at the same latitude as the UK are much much colder. Scotland, for example, is further North than Moscow. It's a lot warmer, though. Same goes for Norway. If you stick to the US, San Francisco and Sacramento are basically at the same latitude as Washington DC.\n\n\nNow, would ice melting completely nullify those currents? Well, sure, there have been examples of the Gulf Stream halting to a stop and all. But salinity is not the only thing driving these currents. It's also trade winds that are linked to the Coriolis effect. And whatever you do, water to the south will be warmer, pushing it to the surface and making it expand, while colder water will sink.\n\n\nBut sure, climate is complex and it will be a whole mess.\n\n\n\n\nAs for a word that means \"less salty\"?

The remnants of these glaciers are still visible as they steadily recede alias melt. What made the glaciers start melting 20k years ago? Global warming. When did the industrial age begin? Roughly two hundred years ago. That leaves 18k years of melting without humans polluting the atmosphere to any significant degree. The problem with environmental activists tying everything to global warming is that the truth is there's no way to stop global warming or even slow it down and the minute this concept is discredited the need for reducing atmospheric pollution also will be discredited by people who want cheap energy, fertilizer and plastic products from fossil fuels. Unfortunately there are still a lot of us who were taught that the frightening part of polluting the atmosphere wasn't the warming part but the tipping point when a new ice age would begin.

I hoped you guys could have figured it out. \nSo during an ice age Earth goes through orbital cycles known as Milankovitch cycles. This changes that amount of solar output hitting the earths surface. This warms the planet releasing CO2 and other greenhouse gasses this warming the planet. This happens through climate feedback loops and earth enters an warm interglacial period. These changes are slow, taking about 10,000 years the planet warms about 5°C during this time. Which is pretty fact on geologic timescale though not nearly as fast as the current warming. Than once in your in an interglacial, earths climate is stable. \n\nI’ll pop a link to how Milankovitch cycles work and their effect on Earths climate system. \nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sir.

CO2 and temperatures stabilized and global temperatures were very stable throughout the Holocene with some very slight regional warming and coolings through out the epoch. \n\nAs for I want an ice age. Um no, I don’t. The reason why I think we should stop human caused global warming is that humans can not survive a world that’s 4°C to 5°C hotter than today. Not been seen for tens of millions of years. A hot house won’t be good for humanity. But an ice age won’t be good either. The current interglacial is fine. The Holocene is the reason why humans arose. So anything much warmer or colder would be bad. Now are their positives to global warming? Yes, some, but are out weighed by the negatives. And the cooling we were seeing before Anthropoecene warming, we were not going to see another glacial period for another 20,000 years. And human caused global warming has already delayed the next ice age by 100,000+ years or even permanently. Some scientists think we may have even ended the Quanterney period all together. \n\nI’m not saying the worlds going to end as many alarmist claim.

But you read to many blogs on the internet saying that global warming is a hoax but at the same time the stupid bloggers are saying “ice age by 2030”. There the ones with the failed predictions.\n\nAlso Al Gore, Greta Thunberg, and AOC aren’t scientist dude. So stop quoting them. Once again read what it says in peer reviewed scientific journals. You said CO2 lagged temperatures. There’s a reason for that I explained. \n\nHumans are adding CO2 into the air, that CO2 is causing global warming. If we don’t stop it means issues for the future. It’s not hard. \n\nI’m honestly done with the conversation. If all your going to do is say “government conspiracy, hoax!” Than there’s no reason to have a mature conversation. Also all major science organizations from around the world are saying humans are causing climate change. You just think scientist woke up one morning and said “let’s create global warming” it’s stupid. We have known since the late 19th century that greenhouse gases cause global warming. Read the conclusions of peer reviewed scientific research and the scientific literature Instead of saying there’s a political agenda. \n\nI suggest watching Potholer54 he’s a science journalist who goes around fact checking media coverage on science by citing peer reviews. sciencefeedback.org dose the same. \n\n\nAlso just go to these websites on climate change. \nNOAA\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information\nhttps://www.climate.gov\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov\nhttps://www.noaa.gov\nNASA\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov\nhttps://data.giss.nasa.gov\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov\nOther Cites\nhttp://berkeleyearth.org/static/pdf/skeptics-guide-to-climate-change.pdf\nhttps://www.skepticalscience.com\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/category/science\nhttps://climatereanalyzer.org\nhttps://www.climatecentral.org\nhttps://www.climatefeedback.org\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch\nhttps://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/Climate-change-QA/What \nhttps://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Space_for_our_climate/Climate_change\nhttps://public.wmo.int/en\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_168058.htm\nVideos\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIU\n13 Misconceptions about Climate Change\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hphdsLcSTYQ\nAre humans causing the warming?\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nEQghbA3pLM\nHow warmer oceans are effecting Earths climate/weather\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oBIQbja-BPY\nHow Global Warming could cause more extreme cold.\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gHuAwxwAs\nHow the Anthropocene is the 6th mass extinction (possibly)\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kSjTsInyveE\nStar Talk on Climate Change \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CNkVGiSgOM4\nSea level rise\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ziqeZTruWMY\nCauses of an ice age through Earths history.\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ihPWZe87Am4&list=WL&index=114&t=0s\nGlobal Warming is Geological Terms\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YQAFqX8bv84\nWhy we confuse weather and climate \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5cY7fSbUWA8&t=15s\nIs a Warming Climate causing more extreme weather\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wjgCaF9BGUo&t=12s\nNo “Solar Ice Age” Coming Soon", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sir.

According to that logic PETM (Paleocene - Eocene thermal maximum) caused an iceage??? 😂😂😂😂😂 And You mean tropics will get warmer and poles cooler, so tropics will reach 60*c avg and poles will hit -90*c avg????? are you joking???? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\n2. Points are here . Co2 increases temperature. Now co2 content is highest in last 35 million years. last time it was this high, antarctic ice just started forming. means very soon antarctic ice is going to melt to that level of initial glaciation. And it won't stop. It can actually reach to PETM level when earth was thriving with tropical biodiversity due to global warming. \n3. in nature , if you notice, every thing, process, etc, when about to stop, becomes a little more aggressive or unstable, ex- flame starts flickering before getting extinguished. Similarly, seasons get destabilized before ceasing to exist. means soon tropics and temperate zones will stop wittnessing heavy seasonal temperature and rainfall changes. Earth will be a tropical paradise. \n4. Earth's axial tilt changes, solar cycle etc doesn't determine earth's surface temp coz they have been happening since 4.5 billion years still we have evidence of hottest Mesozoic era and PETM, Triassic, late Permian, late devonian etc. So it all depends on co2 level. \n6. Desertification actually decreases average global temp. coz a lighter coloured ground of desert reflects more sunlight than the darker tone of tropical rain forest. So co2 actually increases atmospheric water vapor content which in turn increases global temperature ana global rainfall amount. causing wide spreading of tropical forests. \nSo It's a super global warming period is what coming, not a fake iceage theory.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Python", "channel": "UCcfl45Olv63_OqXOATzddig", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT0xrSjoHNple0hEXbfo2MLH4P1gYhK6gcsgaMjLw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwJUgfa26UOOuOhUep4AaABAg", "text": "With all due respect, global warming and global cooling are natural phenomenon and planetary cycles/shifts that result into mini ice age or the opposite every 300-400 years. The upcoming Mini Ice Age is due to occur in the next 10-15 years, if not sooner. Seek and we shall find the truth instead of living in fear. This isn't to say that our humanity has little or no responsibility for the carbon emission footprint. We are to some extent responsible. However the labor of responsibility lays at the helm of a very small minority, controllers, dark overlords of earth for unrecorded history. They have controlled all releases of technology for time immemorial. Since the start of this 5th civilization, they have also smothered at any costs the materialization of any divinely-inspired quantum technology, that which cannot be weaponized, marketed or regulated for profit. They have forgotten the natural order of things. Natural Selection always has its way. This is the way of it. Their recent obscure and vile desperate attempts (their last best efforts) to restart civilization will fail. Although it may cause pain and panic among the populace, we will nevertheless witness their epic recall or demise. This is the way. \n\nEarth is on a prophetic course toward a great transformation and must revitalize itself to regenerate and renew life for its much needed systems (Geo, Bio, hydro.. etc). If we are aware that our universe is expanding, we must also be cognizant that the solar systems, galaxies, and planetary consciousness within, are also expanding, especially those teaming with life, such as our most beloved Mother Earth - Gaia. In the timeless, all matters are relative. Every evolution taking place in the universe is also taking place in the cosmos, the solar systems, planets, and all beings at the cellular level. For this reason, we are indivisible and inseparable from Divine Intelligence, the Infinite Source and Creator that binds all Multiverse, Omniverse, Universe, sub-verses and Creations together as One. What we do to another we do to ourselves and vice versa for we are One.\n\nOur purpose at this point in time is to learn to activate and raise our Consciousness through prayers and/or meditations by going inward to merge our imbalanced minds with the Silence of the Sacred Heart. This resulting balance and peace will enable us access to our internal and mighty compass, and forge a sacred alliance that will help us raise our consciousness and align humanity to nature with love and compassion, for the transmutation of the self-destructive matrix and ascending transformation of Gaia and all species. \n\nThis is inevitable. It is up to us how benevolent nature will follow course. This will also determine how we will fair in the upcoming mini ice age in 10-15 years, if not sooner. Thought is energy and energy is life. The energy we allow to dominate our minds is the experience or fruits of the womb we will harvest. We collectively have the power to delay or expedite matters of the heart, and  to transform our lives, our beautiful planet, our NOW of Time effectively and indefinitely. Humanity and all species are the collective consciousness of Earth. We are the earth in mind, heart, body and spirit. Rest not our minds on fear and thoughts of separation, illusion, division or confusion. Give permission to the Inner Self, our Mighty Compass and verbally allow this Divine Light to fuse our hearts and minds so that together we raise our collective consciousness to bring about global peace enabling love and compassion to take seat in all aspects of our lives, for our highest light path and the highest good and joy of all.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Naal Desravines", "channel": "UCTRdJf2-ppV6XTsovN_o1EQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS8efGQHxDTRReq2EABRCextWIpspDuz27nppsHtw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

SuperThunderGoodGuy lll  All I have to do to refute your comments is show the impact of solar and cosmic forces on our climate. Your argument relies on the notion that solar and cosmic forces have little to no impact on earth's climate. As I previously stated, climate change = human forcing + natural forcing. Let's say A is natural forcing, B is human forcing, C is total climate change. So, A + B = C. If I show that solar and cosmic forces have a significant impact on earth's climate, the entire equation is changed. It will also show that, no, the models DO NOT include all natural variabilities and that human forcing is certainly not the cause of 100% of the global warming. Hopefully we can agree on this basic logic. With that said, I will have an long list of research showing a significant influence of solar and cosmic forcing posted in a few.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Chris Parker", "channel": "UClhHUnFFDSUstJnfxNZTqAA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTIt75b7cqCezKoeXVtDVwfJtK_OQndWFDiAG6h=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This way during hot periods areas like Sahara will greatly warm up while colder Atlantic air will remain pretty cold (compared to Sahara). Currently wind blows mostly from Sahara to ocean because it is sucked by ocean winds but when they stop, then the only thing driving winds will be density difference. Obviously hot Saharan air will be less dense and will cause sucking colder, humid air from above the ocean to be sucked on land. This will reintroduce vegetation, lakes, rivers and even seas to Sahara similarly how it happened roughly 12k years ago when famous Atlantis was the biggest \"seaside\" city located where we have only sand. Surely we'll have much colder climate up north but at the same time we'll gain huge area of habitable, humid space.

The Maunder Minimum etc. are closely related to solar activity cycles, specifically the 115 year cycle. Right now we're at a minimum, yet still temperatures rise globally and now even in the Antarctic ice cap shrinks. In about 60 years there's the solar maximum. This further speeds up ice melt, and I don't think there is any telling of what effect this will have at the deep ocean current. The massive cold \"unsalty\" water dump can drastically slow down the deep current, but if in 60 - 70 years there isn't much Arctic ice left to melt anymore... that dump is over really fast.\n\n\nThird, the more Arctic ice retreats, the more the cool surrounding meltwater retraits too, that creates a northern barrier for both the westerlies and AMOC.\n\nFourth, the past years we've seen cold air being pushed down from the Arctic, particularly in N-America.

If we keep using them, we'll run out eventually.  & if we're gonna try to colonize other worlds & expand out into the solar system, it's not like there's any fossil fuels out there (as far as we can tell).

So the entire planet was frozen solid at the moment of its greatest CO2 concentration. So much for this idiotic link between CO2 and warming. It is even easy to understand why: all the plants were fucking dead, so for millions of years atmospheric CO2 was retained. Then once plant cover returned in the Cambrian the CO2 was scrubbed right out, as indeed it is being at this very moment.

I have already explained to you in all desirable detail that CO2 is not pollution, is not dangerous and cannot possibly build up in the earth's atmosphere as long as the earth is covered in plant life. Which it is. The concentration of CO2 is this absurdly low - almost nonexistent - here because it is being scrubbed! Continuously! Nothing we do has the slightest impact on this fundamental balancing process of the planet. We do other things that are extremely harmful to the environment: nuclear waste, plastic waste, overfishing and other irresonsible exploitations of the natural world, depleted uranium munititions, chemical and toxic waste and so on. But CO2 is not on this list. Claiming that it is betrays an almost complete ignorance of the planet you are living on. Carbon is what all life on the planet is made of, which is why plants are so hungry for it. They in turn remove the carbon atoms from CO2 molecules and the end result is oxygen. So by insisting on this deranged fantasy that CO2 is pollution you are saying that oxygen, the end product of CO2, is pollution. It is hard to imagine a more imbecilic viewpoint - one that befits the atomized zombies of the three TV-watching generations of humans in world history. There is nothing so stupid and degenerate that you can't be made to believe it when televized propaganda is applied.\nAgain: this has NOTHING to do with science or protecting the environment.

So no, you can't trust anything if a politician, bureaucrat, \"think tank\" or activist provocateur group is saying it. It must be assumed to be lies and examined as such, which you are basically doing the opposite of. Whatever they say you believe. Reason, data or actual science you wouldn't recognize if it gave you a haircut.\nAs for your imaginary increase in harmless - beneficial - CO2, what part of \"a single volcanic eruption releases more CO2 than all human activity in 5000 years of recorded history\" don't you understand? Even if Co2 levels were rising, which they are not, it has nothing whatsoever to do with human activity. And even if they were this is not a problem for the reasons I have stated repeatedly. Plant food, sinks to low places, cannot maintain itself as CO2 in the atmosphere but is stored in rocks, water and soil if it isn't turned to oxygen by plants. It is a non-problem, which you would know already if you were capable of independent thought. Think for yourself! Anyone pushing \"expertise\" in front of him to shut down your critical faculties doesn't trust his arguments or data anyway.\nThe \"climatology\" fraud is just another in a long line of obvious scientific frauds and/or bad ideas. Like epicycles and race biology. This happens occasionally when politicians and bureaucrats decide to legitimize their misrule by the use of science. Of course when they do that it isn't science anymore. It is \"science\" and a fraud. And it should be denied. Every word of this sickening genocidal assault on humanity.should be denied.

{"cid": "UgxNlK5c4Dhye7Ru0iN4AaABAg", "text": "I listened very carefully and there was no mention of the sun and the Maunder minimums, Surely that big ball of hot stuff has something to do with warming and cooling. We are experiencing the longest period of no sun spots in modern recorded history, not far off what happened at the beginning of the little ice age, so is it the sun, or is it humans that are the main cause of climate change(bye the way climate has been changing constantly since the planet first formed). I am not saying that global warming is not occurring, after all we are still coming out of an ice age, BUT is man the main cause? I doubt it, although he probably is contributing some with his huge industrial  and chemical factory's, which nobody takes any notice of, because we are told its CO2 that's causing climate change(if you believe that CO2 is the problem then you need to go back to school). Study the sun, its the biggest influence on this planet by far, Scientist who study the sun very rarely think humans have more than a very minor influence on climate, its the suns cycles that cause climate change not SUV's(although they do harm in other ways). My gas and electric bills(in the UK) are 20% higher because of carbon taxes, Do you really think that 20%, that I and Billions more people pay, will have any effect on climate change? But what i do know is an increase or decrease in cosmic radiation has a huge effect on Earth, but don't believe anything I say, research it yourself instead of believing everything the News or the papers or YouTube tells you.

More concerning though is our magnetic field and its rapid decrease that has been occurring in the last 50 years, so much so that we could possibly have a reversal in the next 20 to 100 years, we know it happens approx every 12,000 years and its been 12,000 years since the last reversal, that coupled with a decreasing magnetic shield letting in more space weather is very concerning and yet, we focus on fossil fuel usage. Ah well, The climate has so many factors and what upsets me the most is the simplicity it is presented to the public, Basically the climate normally does this so if its different it has to be because of humans. We have learnt more in the last 15 years about the Sun alone than we ever knew in total, Id be curious when this information is added to climate models.

Back in 2004, Roland Emmerich (the director famous for \"Independence Day,\") made a Climate-Change fueled sci-fi movie about Global Warming reaching such a hostile pinnacle that the \"Gulf Stream,\" or \"North Atlantic Current,\" lost all salinity due to rampant melting polar ice, and completely shut down. What makes this film fictional is the idea that the current shutting down caused an immediate planetary climate-holocaust that affected the entire Northern Hemisphere, and a month-long, planet-wide blizzard that covered everything down to Mexico and Africa in hundreds of feet of snow. \n\n\nNow, obviously, the speed at which this event happened was entirely fictional. No Ice Age ever came about in a matter of weeks or months. It came about in YEARS, if not centuries. But the fundamental theory that shapes the film, according to this video, is absolutely plausible! If the North Atlantic Current (which powers the entire world's current-system by sheer momentum) were to break down. The ocean's natural recycling of warm water to northern climates would cease. Over time, this would cause an equalization of Earth's latitudinal temperature rules, causing hightened warming at the equator, but excessive cooling at the polar ice caps. The ice caps themselves would, over centuries, replenish their ice sheets and traditional cycles, but at the expense of the warm-temperate climate, worldwide, that enabled mankind to dominate the Earth to begin with. \n\n\nAs this video points out; it would happen VERY SLOWLY, (over a century's length, at the very fastest) so none of us alive now would ever live to see the final result. It might even be happening right at this moment, but since we're at the very beginning of this process, none of us can notice. To us, the Earth seems to be still warming. It'll take years, if not decades, for that momentum we are all used to seeing, to slow to a stop. Decades beyond that to move in the opposite direction. Nothing by Earth's standards moves fast. If an Ice Age of our own cause is approaching, it is not us, but our children, and most prominently our grandchildren, who will face the consequences. \"The Day After Tomorrow\" appears to be a not only plausible, but LIKELY, outcome of our fiddling with nature. It just won't happen at \"Hollywood Speed.\" It'll happen at (pardon the expression) a \"glacial\" pace. We'll live long enough to see the beginning of the process, but none of us will ever live long enough to see the end result of it. \n\n\nAnd none of us may want to.

{"cid": "UgwPDzQaUaEdsqZ9uAp4AaABAg", "text": "It has nothing to do with man made anything. As humans we are responsible for as little as 4% of all the co2 emissions currently. Even if high co2 levels could cause a warming this would not be enough, because it is a non accumulative gas that begins breaking down and being absorbed by all the carbon based life on the planet, and to date there has been no actual science done to show if co2 even has the ability to cause a warming affect. NASA recently released data that shows the planet is getting greener ( more plant life), which would verify that the small amount of additional co2 we are responsible for is being absorbed as fast as we are making it. Also the ocean currents are controlled by orbital influences as are the winds and the jet streams and the rivers of lava beneath our feet. The process you described wouldn’t be enough our cause the ocean currents. And the reason the currents appear to stop during ice ages is because ice sheets don’t flow very well. Interesting the global warming crowd is now doubling down saying the current and future cooling we are heading towards is because of the global warming we didn’t believe them about. 😂 A couple of years back NASA also released data showing the Antarctic ice shelf is about 20% more in volume since we’ve been keeping track. These global warming guys didn’t skip a beat and began to blame it on global warming, and then really got themselves worked up about, wait if there’s more ice then why are the ocean levels rising, it was almost complete hysteria. The oceans haven’t risen, even if all the ice melted, the oceans don’t behave like your coffee cup or bath tube. Land sinks land heaves, increased evaporations so on. It’s just another stupid scare tactic like the ocean currents, we will be drowning but some how all dying of thirst in the same sentence nonsense. Natural systems doing there natural cycles.

The earth is located in our solar system to not only be conducive to life but also one that creates a climatic spectrum of environmental factors to challenge living organisms to evolve. I know, change is hard. But we as humans can enjoy our ability to employ migratory patterns in response to our changing environment as we have always done in the past. The climate of the earth can not be viewed within the existence of human life on earth.

We are in a solar minimum period which will continue into the next cycle++ and create even more cooling. If you want to understand climatic changes, you have to understand solar cycles and solar forcing in addition to ocean oscillation, the main climate drivers. CO2 is completely irrelevant. Atmospheric particle levels were MUCH higher during periods of high volcanic activity which caused much cooler weather. Ice cores show clearly that evergreen forests once thrived on the south pole while ice was completely absent from the north polar area.These are very normal cycles that ultimately sort themselves, obviously. More CO2 = more green plants and faster tree growth. At 400 ppm, CO2 is at deficit levels for optimal plant growth. Global warming is politics, not science. Yada yada yada ... and all of those past 'extreme' cycles happened well before industrialization and the use of fossil fuels. You need to figure out how to control the sun and stop H2O (the main greenhouse gas) evaporation, not people. Good luck with that!  At least the powers that be have figured out that the gig is just about up on the runaway warming propaganda. Now, they're coming up with non-sense for how (human-caused) warming equals increasing cooling. lol  At least they'll have less egg on their faces when the planet hasn't melted down in 12 years.

So as earth settled co2 levels dropped and it doesn’t matter where co2 is in the grand scheme of things cause co2 isn’t the main green house gas ,it’s vapor that’s the main gas and not only that it’s the suns activity that helps determine earths temp and co2 also lags behind temperatures,as the earths oceans warm and it takes along time to do so only when the temps of ocean is warm enough does co2 levels climb,so temps first then co2 and again their models are so WRONG that is why they changed the name from gw to cc,so if the earth does go into a very cold period( due to lack of sun activity) they these paid off United Nations scientists can still say it was due to human beings.\nYou see I’ve been following their lies for almost four decades and not a single one of their so called predictions has come true\nLastly we are actually in a co2 drought ,for optimum plant growth co2 levels in to be around 1200 ppm,yes co2 is plant food,the more they get the better they do ,oh also the more co2 plants get the less water they need.\n\nTo all dumb dumbs that believe this human made gw crap and want to do away with co2 well good luck with slaughtering the entire plant life,animal life and human race,cause that’s what you will do when you remove co2.\n\nLastly if it gets cooler over the coming yrs it could be because we are due to go into a solar minimal,suns activity slowing down.\nYour welcome.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Leanne Patriot", "channel": "UC0t7Jj1mjmJHmCoGYIGI1yA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT7pYLGEY8hbpoDzuT1OsCdT6RuYlfjpCIusg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you turned the map, twisting it so the left side goes up a bit, and kept the right side stationary, keep the the grid as it is, your temperature colors might match latitude lines....Not to mention that the sun's output significantly decreased in the LITTLE ICE AGE, and is now trending downward, in an identical manner. It's a 400 year cycle if you research it. In addition, when solar wind (among other outputs of the sun) decreases, more cosmic rays enter our atmosphere (especially as our magnetosphere lacks it's usual strength-the present condition-falling to all time lows-allowing more cosmic rays to penetrate the atmosphere). Energy from the cosmic rays increase cloud nucleation, causing more cloud formation, AND strengthens storms already in progress. The result is increased albedo, cooling the planet,  more rainfall (snofall), and changing weather patterns, The sun's decreased output is even having effects on other planets in our solar system.

Really, a picture of the last 200,000 years of pretty solid climate data would do, though... slight ups slight downs, waves of natural change within adaptable norms even through massive transitions from glaciation to warm spell and back.  And were you and actual climate scientists there the whole time it would be them saying 'watch out, this change may make crop yields not only change, but shift away from where folk presently live' and you'd be saying 'alarmist alarmist alarmist; it's a conspiracy!' and they'd be right and you'd be like 'as I said all along' and even talked yourself into believing it.  Trouble is, this time there's nothing natural about the shift.  The gradual changes that used to take generations not only are happening all at once, but to say it was happened with ten times the intensity, beyond anything seen in the fossil record short of asteroid impacts would be to understate the matter, and scientists have been warning us since the 1904 (not the 80s as you claim) and now folk are like 'nothing to see here, folks.'  \n\nYou've a lot of research to do for your own sake.  See 'feedback effects' and exponential math and a little thing called entropy, especially in regards to the sudden doubling of energy addition into an increasingly enclosed medium.  Hell... put two fish tanks on a sunny porch, one sealed with a big 'ol block of dry ice and both with thermometers, give 'em a while, and get back to us.

Are you scared of the cold? Cause the way you phrased it, you said \"1° tilt and everyone is dead\", that just states you afraid of the cold.\nIf the poles are shifting, does that alter the weather that drastically?

It would affect sunlight mainly, but the magnetic field is more the worry.\nNow, if we tilted 1° back, we are just colder by a big amount, unless the sun is heavy on solar activity, and that has a big role to play.\nIf the ocean water got warmer for a short time, that also affects more than you think! The west coast of the North American Continent got warmer and that heat later hit Alaska. Alaska broke records by hitting the 90°F temperature range it was not supposed to, but thanks to the Ocean warm-up.\nSo, just a change in a small tilt has not say to kill us.

Not denying the part the gulf stream plays in this, but man is not the cause. We need more CO2 Not less. Ice cores and tree rings show a huge plethora of CO2 in our atmosphere, way before man was ever a factor. This change is cyclical. A natural order. Basic science teaches that plants need CO2 to live. The lower the Co2 the more plants have to work to get it. Which means they lose more water, basically, they are drying out and becoming more flammable.

The most likely influence during this period is variable output from the sun combined with pronounced volcanic activity. We know that from the end of the LIA to the 1950s the sun’s output increased. But since WW2 the sun has slowly grown quieter, yet the temperature on Earth has gone up.\r\n\r\nThe sceptical argument that current warming is a continuation of the same warming that ended the LIA is unlikely. There is a lack of evidence for a suitable forcing (e.g. the sun) and numerous correlations with known natural forcings that can account for the LIA itself, and the subsequent climate recovery.

Self sustaining pretty much with 10% of the water usage of traditional farming as it's a recirculation system. Your basicly just replacing evoporated water. Fish waste feeds the plants and the plants can feed the fish as well depending on what you are growing. We are using tillapia and when the fish get too big you can cull it and have your protein to go with the veggies. We haven't done that yet as it's not a commercial set-up (1,000 gallon tank) and they are kinda more like pets.

We exited the last glaciation about 15k years bp. (Ignoring the Younger Dryas). The previous interglacials were at about 110k year intervals and none of the last 3 lasted anywhere near 15k years. The last interglacial to last as long as the current one was 410k years bp and it only lasted 10k years.\n\n\nI'm going by the Vostok ice cores which simply do not show what you are describing. AFAIK these are pretty definitive, so if you have data that contradicts them, I'd like to see it. And I have seen estimates that this interglacial will last 50k years. I doubt this simply because the average temperatures have been dropping for the last 8k years. The bottom of the \"Little Ice Age\", circa 1800 was the coldest the planet has been in about 8,000 years.\n\n\nWhile temps go up and down over a thousand years or so, the pattern has been that each peak is lower than the last and each trough has been colder than the last.

We're still in the Ice Age and will be so for a long time yet. \n\n\nBut hey, I'm still learning too. Coming into the warm period might be the reason we have agriculture and civilisation. Humans like us evolved over 100k years ago and yet did virtually nothing development wise until 10k years ago.

{"cid": "UgxyXBJWYfhhCWmmxKt4AaABAg.8y7eIpqbaxG8ysJG5zpkxZ", "text": " @wes c  No problem! \nHere is an example of link for albedo: https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/gallery/global_albedo_seasonal\n\n\nI don't know much about GCR. However I can tell you this: clouds are atmospheric humidity (water vapor) transformed into water liquid or water solid. \nTo transform water from liquid to vapor state, energy is taken, - when evaporation occur at the ocean, or on land, it is cooling the environment. This energy is later on released in the atmosphere, when water vapor transforms into liquid or solid. \nAnyway the point here is: there can only be as much clouds as there is water vapor in the atmosphere. GCR won't create clouds out of nowhere. \n\n\nI saw on article on GCR but I could tell it was a weird article as it was denying atmospheric CO2 is increasing - something that we have measured accurately for years. Do you have a reference for an article about GCR and clouds? \n\n\nAbout the sun cycle, it is an easy exercise to answer your question. (clouds are much more complicated). \nRemember the equation on wikipedia: \n\n\n(1-a)S=4 e s T^4\n\n\nyou can easily calculate equilibrium T from this. I'll do it for you: \nS = 1367; % Solar constant\r\na = 0.3; % Earth average albedo\r\ns = 5.67e-8; % Stefan-Boltzmann constant\r\ne = 0.612; % Effective emissivity of earth\n\n\nT = ((1-a)*S/(4*e*s))^(1/4) - 273.15 = 15 (degree C)\n\n\nnow if you google solar cycle, look for images, you'll see the value of S varying between 1367 and 1365 (W m-2)\nif I use S = 1365 I get: \n\n\nT = ((1-a)*S/(4*e*s))^(1/4) - 273.15 = 14.9 (degree C)\n\n\nAs you can see... that's not a big change. The solar cycle doesn't have a big impact on Earth climate (but milankovitch cycle does!! but on much longer time scale.)\n\n\nIn the equation, what has changed and continue to change is global albedo (a) and the effective emissivity of Earth. \n\n\nIf e was 1 (without atmospheric CO2), we would have: \ne= 1;\n\n\nT = ((1-a)*S/(4*e*s))^(1/4) - 273.15 = -18.3 (degree C)\n\n\n33 degree C colder! So it's a good thing we have some CO2 in the atmosphere. \nnow, if the effective emissivity of Earth was 0, that would mean that all heat is trapped on earth... at 0, the temperature would just keep increasing (there is no T equilibrium, because there's only heat going in, and no heat going out - T keeps increasing). \n\n\nOn some planet, such as Venus, there is a lot of greenhouse gas, causing T to be very high. Average temperature on Venus is 462 degree C. \n\n\nIn the next 2 or 3 decades, global temperature will probably continue to rise, as CO2 will increase and trap more heat. \n\n\nRead this one, I think it explains things pretty well! https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Tundra_Hunter", "channel": "UCF5MA1KON8O6j8pqoKY5vTw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR5SUNc3QcYl4MXz91tyTIHeNVGaaTPlYtsFQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also because of temperature, some water gets trapped into Ice (maybe the reason why it gets pulled to  the poles in the first place?).\nAnway, water sinks, goes to the south, comes back up, and does the route again.\n\n\nWhat happens if we warm the wind temperatures?\nIce at the poles melt, letting go of more \"pure\" unsalinated water. This mixes with over-salinated water, changing its density, and stopping it from drowning back again.\nIf this current stops, cold water won't flow back to the equator, not cooling the land on its way, removing a temperature stabilisator phenomena at the same time.\n\n\nSo although the poles get hoter, the waters get less salty, and more \"floaty\".\n\n\nBut if the equator get hoter, more wind turbulances will occure. The land in between the poles and the equator might not get wamredup as much for the waters, but maybe hoter from the winds. We will get more into the extremes, and have less \"stable\" climates.\n\n\nAm I right?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Axel DAVAL", "channel": "UCHNEO8cZQwm_jUFNt4UkpNA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTs06jJBsdJggYh9TMN94s47yIOnz7YG5U_bA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is why icebergs and glaciers contain freshwater. \n\nYou are right in the sense that ice already in the ocean does not contribute to rising sea levels. But the point of this video is to describe how current climate change patterns causing the melting of ice in the Artic lead to an Ice Age, causing higher temperatures near the equator and lower temperatures near the north.  The rising sea levels is also an issue but not caused by melting ice already in the ocean.

I can't find a reference or citation on that, but have read that from several sources.  One of the reasons the term Global Warming was dropped in favor of Climate Change is that Great Britain is likely to get colder due to changes in the Gulf Stream.  \n\n\nThe size of the minimum summer ice layer on the Arctic Ocean is not only getting much smaller, the thickness of it has declined faster than its shrinkage in size.  That is causing greater oscillation in the northern jet stream, which seems to be causing colder weather in the eastern U.S.  I first read about this change in oscillation causing the eastern states cool down about 25-30 years ago so I viewed the national news coverage of the winters back there with perhaps a different perspective than a lot of people.   \n\n\nI first read about a cool down in store for western northern Europe about 10-15 years ago so I'm watching the news on BBC with that in mind.  \n\n\nYour audio sounds like it is over modulating.

If you are right about your second statement (solar cycles), then you are wrong about your first statement (there's no such thing as global warming) because your second statement claims global warming is real (and caused by solar cycles).\nI'm no expert on the whole 'solar cycle' thing, so I'm gonna assume solar activity does play a role in climate change (though Earth's shielding mechanisms are pretty damn good, so I'm gonna go with 'it's but a relatively small effect'), but if we look at the earth's history, then activities of life have played a monumental role in causing climate change through chemical atmospheric alteration. Human activity incorporates machines that add to that, while we've also (in the past) been stripping Earth from mechanisms that lock atmospheric greenhouse chemicals down (trees, for example). \nThe anthropogenic element to climate change is but one of many, it's absolutely true, but if you take a bucket, put it under a dripping tap, wait until it's nearly full, and then pour half a liter of water on top of that, then denying that that half a liter of water had any influence in the bucket overflowing is just nonsense.

It is simply a fallacy to think that you can moralize your way out of a problem created by collective activity. The reality is this problem can only be solved top-down, through concerted collective efforts of entire nations. You cannot solve climate change through a change in what you consume, nearly every product and every service you use is part of a long chain of production which relies on activity that is exacerbating climate change. You cannot as an individual stop the CO2 output by megacorporations in industry and agriculture and transport. All you can do is vote for a government that will pass laws to stop these things, that will direct vast amounts of manpower and resources to undertake a change toward a sustainable infrastructure and economy. Individual activity is only a small fraction of the problem and you won't make a dent in the CO2 output even if everyone went vegan overnight and only ever used public transport, because the majority of the CO2 is produced by industry. The corporations have to be forced at gunpoint to change the way they operate because they will never do it of their own volition, no company will willingly sacrifice profits for their shareholders unless the government makes them. Hence the need to take political power and control the army. Capitalism will never stop climaten change of its own accord, it's the reason why we're in this shit in the first place.

American coasts get to burn while Europe freezes to death\". Actually that's completely wrong. The Jet Stream locks at the N. American Atlantic coast and makes the eastern half of N. America in winter as cold as the Arctic sometimes. Here at Lake Huron I checked on January 21, 2019 and the air at 7,000 feet above sea level was colder than the air at 7,000 feet over any of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS), 2/3rds of the Arctic Ocean and most of Siberia. It's ridiculous. The global warming has fucked up the Jet Stream so much that the North Pole cold is sometimes 3,000 km south over James Bay and the north pole is warmer. Right now it's 7.5 degrees on June 4, 2019 at Lake Huron. The coast of Greenland is warmer. It's all fucked up here in eastern N. America. And it's permanent because it's been caused by this fucking global warming that isn't ever going back to what it was.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "grindupBaker", "channel": "UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTcR5Yo60l8Y-y8hgalXp77iqFF83W8z2bO_4_rpw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwIYSjlAZUXbkiHrJF4AaABAg", "text": "Information I've seen shows the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) to have been as warm or warmer than today. What caused the end of the MWP and the beginning of the Little Ice Age (LIA) is up for debate and the two leading contenders I've seen for what caused it to end are volcanic activity and solar activity. The coldest period of the LIA began in the 1600s, by which time solar activity was being monitored, so we know that in the 1600s solar activity decreased greatly and entered what called a Grand Solar Minimum. This grand solar minimum is referred to as the Maunder Minimum named after the scientist who was measuring daily solar activity at that time. In 1815 the eruption of Mount Tambora caused a volcanic winter which lasted for a number of years and caused the year without a summer in 1816. After the effects of the Tambora eruption subsided the earth began to warm until the 1940s when a global cooling trend began which lasted until the the late 1970s. This is why in the 1970s many scientists and some government agencies were concerned about or predicting the beginning of a new ice age. Here are a couple of examples of the kind of news articles I was reading in the 1970s and what I was seeing on TV.\n\nU.S. and Soviet Press Studies of a Colder Arctic\n\"The United States and the Soviet Union are mounting large‐scale investigations to determine why the Arctic climate is becoming more frigid, why parts of the Arctic sea ice have recently become ominously thicker and whether the extent of that ice cover contributes to the onset of ice ages.\"\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/18/archives/us-and-soviet-press-studies-of-a-colder-arctic-us-and-soviet-press.html\n\nThe Cooling World \n\n\"Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay its effects. They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed, such as melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers, might create problems far greater than those they solve.\"\nhttp://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/newsweek-coolingworld.pdfClimatologists are\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_861us8D9M\n\nBeginning in the 1970s solar activity began to increase causing NASA's Skylab to crash to earth earlier than expected and by the late 1970s/1980s cooling had stopped and warming began. \n\n\"Greater-than-expected solar activity heated the outer layers of Earth's atmosphere and increased drag on Skylab. By late 1977, NORAD also forecast a reentry in mid-1979; a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist criticized NASA for using an inaccurate model for the second most-intense sunspot cycle in a century, and for ignoring NOAA predictions published in 1976.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s solar activity increased to the highest level seen in modern times and is called the Modern Solar Maximum. In the early 2000s solar activity began to decrease which caused the global warming pause. Since the early 2000s there has been no \"significant\" warming and the small amount of warming that has occurred is far below the predictions made by climate models. Based on the paleoclimate record grand solar minimums occur about every 400 years and the last grand solar minimum occurred 400 years ago. The last two 11-year solar cycles have seen a huge decrease in solar activity which mirrors the solar activity seen at the beginning of the Maunder Minimum in the 1600s. \n\nHere is a BBC report from 2015 about the decreasing solar activity:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DueVWamHmYs\n\nHere is a news article from 2018: The Chill of Solar Minimum - As 2018 comes to an end, the Thermosphere Climate Index is on the verge of setting a Space Age record for Cold. “We’re not there quite yet,” says Mlynczak, “but it could happen in a matter of months.”\nhttps://spaceweatherarchive.com/2018/09/27/the-chill-of-solar-minimum/\n\nHere is a documentary about the Little Ice Age: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZFXZ0bATyc\n\nBy the way, during the Little Ice Age witchcraft and Satan were blamed for climate change. In this round of climate change Satan is no longer blamed but humans still are.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "X109", "channel": "UCdClbGo-OCFNd4AOgCfJ-3g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS-d4WKrhAw-AexyHEqQdRpQeGas4w6PjExf0_S=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzNZLSryA8FzZXif654AaABAg", "text": "Not all studies are created equal that being said you're leaving out a massive piece of the puzzle and by you're I mean climatologists but since the piece of the puzzle they're leaving out is outside of their wheelhouse it's almost understandable I mean they're climatologists not solar physicists\n\nLet me go ahead and jump in here and say that there are a million and one reasons why we need to stop poisoning our planet and things need to be done about that immediately if not sooner with that being said\n\nTo clarify what I mean here let me preface this by saying the 90 something percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and man-made line of bullshit the news media tries to feed us comes from a single conglomerate study that's a decade-old that only counted scientific papers put out by climatologists at the time that took a hardcore stance on whether or not climate change was man-made and real if the paper did not take a stance either way or only took a stance on either it being real or it being man-made they were not included so the end result only included roughly 30% of the climate papers available at the time a decade ago\n\nSince then the bread and butter of securing funding for further research for climatologists has been anything having to do with climate change and this has resulted in some dishonesty cherry picking of results and poor interpretations a lot of times just by leaving out highly significant variables\n\nMost climate papers studies and ergo the simulations and predictions based on them only count one type of solar forcing and that is UV exposure which only counts a 4% variance in irradiance which is negligible and occasionally you'll find a study that factors in sunspot variability when in reality there is closer to a dozen different types of solar forcing and many of the other types have a vastly greater impact on our planet and When taking into account they paint a entirely different picture as to why our climate has been changing\n\nThere is one significant piece of evidence that is counted as scientific fact Undisputed and simultaneously somehow has flown under the radar of climatologists whether intentionally or by accident and that is the fact that every planet in our solar system has experienced a significant change in climate during the same time periods as Earth knowing that fact you can realize that either somehow driving your car here on Earth affects the temperature of every planet in the solar system or these solar system-wide changes in climate are being caused by something that affects the solar system as a whole and there is only one thing that can do that and that's the Sun.\n has the sun been doing anything interesting during this period Of time possibly something that correlates with the observation that every planet in the Solar System's climate has experienced a significant change yes there is the Sun goes through Cycles where it is more and less active and while most people are familiar with the seven-year sunspot cycle they are unaware of the larger 400-year activity cycle known as the grand solar maximum Grand solar minimum cycle and if we look at geological evidence and historic records of the climate 400 years ago we come across a time in our history known as the maunder minimum sometimes nicknamed the mini ice age\n\nI know what you're thinking you're thinking but the climate is getting hotter not colder but let me tell you that's the thing the way the solar Cycles work you hit the peak of grand solar maximum right before the start of grand solar minimum and in 2018 the sun started going long periods of time without a single sunspot currently the sun is so inactive that the number of sunspots as of June 4th 2019 hasn't exceeded double-digits in the preceding decades it was not uncommon to have literally hundreds of sunspots on the sun simultaneously\n\nThe other problem with the man-made climate change argument is the fact that greenhouse gases compose of 0.1% of our atmosphere and of that 0.1% carbon dioxide only accounts for 4% and of that carbon dioxide Mankind's contribution accounts for 3.4%\nSo just for emphasis the whole of Mankind's contribution to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in total is 3.4% of 4% of 0.1%\n\nThat's so small of an amount it's ridiculous to think that it has even the faintest hope of changing the average temperature by even one one hundredth of a degree that's like putting a drop of boiling water into a swimming pool and thinking it's going to change the temperature\n\nThere's a YouTube channel that has a video series on this it goes into far more detail the name of the channel is Suspicious Observers if you need any

Because if you are talk about bob from the street-or bob the politician- it does not matter what they think, it matters what the scientists on this subject think from the data. I’m assuming if you are a climate change ‘skeptic’ you have to trick people or yourself in giving half truths all around, and when confronted with full facts you then resort to conspiracy? The data about solar irradiance is available publicly and it show that the sun has not increased its solar out put for like 30-40 years(go check the research, my number does not matter it’s a guess from what I remember) and even decreased a little but yet temperatures have not stopped rising to record highs. This should spell trouble to you hypothesis that the sun is what is making the earth today precipitously hotter. You are in fact acting like independent scientists from around the world are incompetent to verify the legitimacy of the data, and the ones making the data are doing so to get more tax payer money?

Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.\n\nScientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.\n- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nThe current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.1\n\nEarth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.\n\nThe heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.\n\nIce cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warmin\n\nThe evidence for rapid climate change is compelling:\nGlobal Temperature Rise\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century\nThe planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year — from January through September, with the exception of June — were the warmest on record for those respective months. 5\n\nWarming Oceans\nThe oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.\nThe oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.6\n\nShrinking Ice Sheets\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass\nThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade\n\n\n\nGlacial Retreat\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.\nGlaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.8\n\nDecreased Snow Cover\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier\nSatellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier.9\n+ MORE\nSea Level Rise\nGlobal sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century.

In the second place, you can get away from cold easier than you can get away from heat. Staving off cold is just a matter of good preparation, but heat? Heat follows you. It seeps into everything. Sure, I could take a cold bath, but then I can't be productive. And if I don't, I'm sweaty and thirsty and uncomfortable all day (and night), so I still can't be as productive. Thermodynamics is a bitch, eh? And as a bonus--maybe this is personal preference, maybe it's my Canadian-ness--I find that I prefer large, dangerous animals to things like bugs or snakes or what have you. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the former category of creature has a lot more trouble inviting itself into my house. The leggy bois show up whenever they want at this time of year, making me disgusted if not quite afraid, but in the winter, which is a good two-thirds of the year around here, they mercifully fuck off.

Not the same can be said about China. China is the No.1 emitter of CO2 and No.1 emitter of pollutants from burning coal. Worse still, China is at the upwind location of the USA. That means the USA is the country  harmed most by China's heavy pollutants.

The leading hypothesis is that the end-Permian extinction was caused by massive volcanic eruptions that spewed more than 4 million cubic kilometers of lava over what is now known as the Siberian Traps, in Siberia, Russia. Such immense and sustained eruptions likely released huge amounts of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide into the air, heating the atmosphere and acidifying the oceans.\"\n\n\n\nThe End-Permian extinction reminds me of the sudden death of 1,700 people living near Lake Nyos located in the Cameroon Volcanic Line in August 21, 1986. A huge quantity of volcanic gas including CO2 was trapped at the bottom of Lake Nyos under water pressure. The warm water at the top of the lake was unable to sink to the bottom because of its lower density. Therefore, the CO2 was trapped in the bottom where the temperature was lower. However, on that fateful day, an earthquake and possibly one or more landslide disrupted the concentrated CO2 at the bottom of the lake and cause huge quantity of CO2 to rise up to the surface of the lake. \n\n\n \"an explosive degassing of 1.6 million tons of carbon-dioxide occurred, forming a 160 feet high cloud. The invisible and odorless carbon dioxide was heavier than normal air and the cloud descended quickly from the slopes of Nyos and filled the surrounding valleys, covering the villages with an asphyxiating blanket of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is toxic, and at concentrations of 6-8 percent (the normal concentration in the atmosphere is 0.04 percent ) it causes almost immediate unconsciousness and death. \"\n\n\n(For comparison, the scare mongering \"high\" concentration about 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere today is only 0.04% , or about 0.57% of the concentration that is toxic to humans. Therefore, it is foolish to talk about the CO2 at today's level as if it were as dangerous as the sudden release of huge quantity of volcanic CO2 in the End-Permian extinction. )\n\n\nTo prevent future catastrophic events, degassing pipes with water pumps were installed in Lake Nyos to allow the CO2 to be released to the surface instead of allowing the CO2 to be accumulated at the bottom of the lake.  Since the CO2 is released gradually day after day, year after year.

Figure 9.5 shows that simulations that incorporate anthropogenic forcings, including\r increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and the effects of aerosols, and that also incorporate natural external forcings provide a consistent explanation of the observed temperature record, whereas simulations that include only natural forcings do not simulate the warming observed over the last three decades.\"\n\nNow let's see why anthropogenic forcings are being used by the global warming scammers: \nOpen the video \"Corruption Of The US Temperature Record\"\n\nTake a good look at 4:53 of the video showing a comparison of the graph made from RAW temperature data (in blue) to the graph made from \"ADJUSTED\" temperature data (in red).  We can see that the lackey scientists of the global warming scammers have tempered with the real temperature data before 2006 to lower temperatures but tempered with the real temperature data after 2006 to higher temperatures to create the false impression of rapid global warming.

Which is subjective to say the least. But the world was one degree lower before industrial revolution and that is artificial shift for sure. The sun dont make those abrupt changes all of a sudden, all the ice age or global warmings on the past take around hundred thousand years (sometimes more, sometimes less) to occur. The current tendency speaks of only decades or maybe a hundred years to rise another one degree, how is that natural or gradual to you? And why do you dismiss the greenhouse gases protagonism at all? You can create a greenhouse in your backyard and see the effects yourself. We can also calculate the tones of emmissions of those gases into the atmosphere and correlate the information we got.  Also its observable in the solar system, we can easily disregard the sun as just one variable. Venus is hotter than mercury being more closer to us than anyother planet, but having a thick atmosphere make it have almost 400º C instead of the 25ºC it should have by its position on the goldilock zone. As the same way, they are liquid oceans in distant moons like enceladus or Europa, even though they have a frozen crust in the top. Our planet alone does not relate exactly to the ammount of heat and direction of solar rays that it hit us, there is a complex system that alter what it should happen if it wasnt there.

Unlike the cult of climate, the data here will, for all the wrong reasons, provide some degree of accuracy in predicting future climate. For those with the guts to face the truth, mankind was never the driver of climate. The climate already had a reputation for change long before man and like all anthropocentric thinking, man has over assumed itself as the only source of change. In fact, it was changing long before us, and if you follow the changes, you will find no deviation from historic trend has occurred (something that surprisingly, a few people have trouble swallowing). There is a yet bigger picture of cause and effect in and around Earth's environment, the details of which comprise the next major scientific era. But in short, the poles generate cold. The equator generates heat. Warm and cold eras are built on which one gets to transport it's temp over most of earth's surface. So in the depth of an ice age, the equator will be cooler, in a hot house Earth, the poles warmer. There is no greenhouse effect because there is no trapping of the heat like in a greenhouse. The entire \"greenhouse effect\" is built on a very low IQ. Right now, a cold era is dominating in total contradiction to global warming theory. That is why, in the US, we just had the coldest spring ever in US history. A lot of rain is occurring because warm air is being hit with cold that knocks the moisture right out of the air,... just like how every cold era starts.

Rather, more truth would lie, if you ask me, in the assumption that the kind of world economy we are currently enjoying is not, strictly speaking, capitalist. \nCapitalism occurs when two parties trade objects, and both parties consider themselves to have gained more worth than they lost. For example: A hunter trades a deer for an axe at the flinter. The flinter, who has worked to create the axe, values a deer more than the hunter, who is in need of a new axe. In this transaction, worth is created in excess by the experience of value of both participants. This is the sense in which capitalism has a theoretically infinite ability to generate wealth through worth, through essentially people's perception of the value of products.\n\n\nWhat is happening currently, however, is an upper class who siphons that value out of the overall economy. \nAn example here is investment and shares. Shares were initially created so that entrepreneurs could create businesses that were too large for the entrepreneurs to  afford. They did this by selling shares of the future profit to people; people would buy those shares, and in return would (eventually) get profit, while the entrepreneur would now have a vast sum of money to invest.\nThe problem is that those who held those shares would then sell those shares to other people; the stock market. Every time a share is sold for a profit, a bit of that share's value disappears in the profit that is made. \nWhen the top % of the population makes its money by doing so (or employing people who do so on their behalf), then that lost value disappears into their bank accounts, where it effectively doesn't exist. It does not circulate back into the economy. That is why this system requires infinite value; because value is depleted infinitely (over time), rather than created. \nI think that itself makes a very good case that this system that is our downfall is not Capitalism.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Stirgid Lanathiel", "channel": "UCTzgY-DUj1fZPweZqPnYSCQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTkYxbfFzSqXdRmR_E5LtuHkmxxLJYgExOYcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The simplistic, idealized model of capitalism you described doesn't exist, has never existed and never can. There's no such thing as an ideal free market or \"pure capitalism\", economic power is always combined with political power. Capitalism is the mode of production based on private ownership of the means of production. In practice this means capital being used to generate more capital, surplus value being extracted from exploited labor and market speculation.\n\nWhat you described happening currently is correct but it's the inevitable and only logical conclusion of the capitalist market system. It can be no other way.

Value is not an inherent or easily quantifiable trait. \n\n\nThere is, indeed, no such thing as a 'pure capitalist market.' Not in a system where value is given quantifiable representation (money). However, 'capitalism' is not the same as 'pure free market.' As I have argued before. Capitalism can be maintained in a controlled market, and still be capitalist... And it can be overruled in an exploitative market, where value is lost to hoarders faster than it can be created.\n\n\nPlease understand that I am using the term 'capitalist' completely devoid of any political biases. I find that politics muddies the water and makes it impossible to fairly discuss these topics; we get so bogged down in tribalist competition that we forget about solving the issues at hand. Communism offers an alternative to capitalism, but communism in its purest form can only maintain an equilibrium of value at best, and a loss of value at worst. After all, if a labourer gets the same average for their effort as everybody else, even when they work harder, then to the labourer, value is lost and can only be regained by working less hard. (The same problem exists with wages that lie below the minimum living wage, which is a prominent feature of the USA's economic system).\nSocialism, however, offers not so much alternatives to capitalism as safeguards against exploitation and corruption of capitalism. In order to keep the market free, it has to be controlled against the actions of bad players. There's many methods that can be employed, from imposed parameters to active government market undercutting (an example of which is Public Healthcare; the private sector isn't banned from participation, but everyone is ensured coverage at reasonable prices set by the competition of an undercutting Third Party agent, which is the government. Another example is China, whose government buys up farmed produce so that megacorporations cannot control, and thereby reduce, the agricultural options).\n\n\n'Capitalism' is not a dirty word.

Everything else in politics is a smokescreen. I disagree with your assertion that everyone has to be paid equally under communism and historical implementations also prove you wrong. Under Soviet socialism the more highly skilled (requiring higher education) or more dangerous labor was compensated better than average menial work, and excellence in the technical fields like math, engineering and science was encouraged and fostered by the educational system. In China during the cultural revolution when many people were organized into autonomous, self-managed collective communes, they set their own wages according to a democratic system of points awarded based on quality of work, difficulty, work hours, etc. they were not all paid equally but ownership was communal and management democratic and had a lot of worker participation, they would debate issues in local worker councils and express their opinions on the best course of action. This is what communism means, it's about collective ownership and workplace democracy. Private ownership automatically results in exploitation by those with means of production of those without. A market economy even when regulated will still be unstable and periodically crash, it will always lead to wealth accumulation and thereby accumulation of political power by a few elites, thus undermining democracy.

It's a red herring.\nYou're taking 'yeah, climate change is gonna happen anyway' to mean 'therefore the rate at which climate change is currently happening is not in part due to human activity.'\n\n\nBasically: You're being lied to. Nobody in the environmentalist corner is denying natural climate change cycles happen regardless. The normal climate change cycles are not the point. Sure, those would have a great impact. Again; not denying that. But with a denser atmosphere that still allows plenty of light to pass, the world is retaining extra heat. More heat than it otherwise would. And the growing Sahara, which human activity contributed to greatly (albeit that activity was greatly reduced some 3000 years ago; still, the lack of trees in the region is still a fact) doesn't exactly help matters. The desert belt is allowed to grow much faster than it ordinarily would have due to human exploitation of the landscape. China and the South and Midwest of North America have been doing that much more recently, and have been doing it for thousands of years.\n\n\nYes, climate change is happening regardless. But human activity greatly exacerbates it. We're not going to stop it by diminishing our resource use. But we can at least diminish the rate somewhat, and take steps (such as the reforestation siege lines now being built in sub-Saharan Africa) to further reduce the impact of climate change.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Stirgid Lanathiel", "channel": "UCTzgY-DUj1fZPweZqPnYSCQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTkYxbfFzSqXdRmR_E5LtuHkmxxLJYgExOYcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Its like those blowing up in especially amedicanlandd land news when its snowing calling it blizzard lol or when they seem to claim Tornados is a new thing there. \n\n\nFact is temperature goes up and down with several houndred years to several thousand years cycles difference even before use of fossil fuels so how do you explain that? Exactly climate changes over time all the time and have always done. What if you put fear into your dumb population we could add taxes to shit and get richer. Exactly whats happening in my country and probably many more. Ignorant uneducated morons fall for this mass hysteria called climate change which is actually normal regulation of the ecosystem. I checked temperature on Antarctic last summer, it was -62C°. I assume your american and read Fahrenheit = -79.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Climate changes are normal \"in an ecosystem\" just like earth is. People are easily manipulated cause they are dumb sadly.

{"cid": "Ugyela1MnoWf4YQ3I-J4AaABAg", "text": "Um Ah Um, No. Climate Change can not cause an ice age. Why?  An ice age is what happens when the climate changes. Ice ages are caused by the planets rotation around the sun and the tilt of the earths axis over a 48,000+ year time frame.  It is why there was an ice age 12,000 years ago that had just lasted 12,000  years long. There will be another Ice age form over the next 12,000 years. Then, 12,000 years from now. Ice a mile high will be covering Mich, NY, and NJ, in June. This will last for about 12,000 years when it will start to go back to today's temps over the next 12,000 years. THIS IS WHAT MAKES ICE AGES! We are trying to keep up with this 2 oct-trillion ton of burning plasma called THE SUN. Which is shooting threw space at an ave speed of 515,00 MPH. After a while the orbit of earth stretches and we spend most of the year farther away from then sun. Then the sun's OVER WHELMING gravity drags us slowly over 12,000 years back into a more circular orbit like we are today. This process takes about 48,000 years to complete and the earth's axis is changed 4 times during this time frame from a southern tip,  like we are in now, to a northern tip. This tipping is caused by the entropy of the earths electromagnetic shield. This is what caused the last ice age to make ice to be a mile deep in NY 12,000+ years ago. The northern hemisphere was tilted away from the sun for 12,000 years.  And our orbit was just ending a more elliptical pattern around the sun.  We are again now into 1,000 years of the earth going in a more elliptical orbit away from the sun. The temps should be going down but they are not. We should have continued the mini ice age. But the warming of 6 billion people has stop the earth from freezing are pants off. This may be an issue in the next 100 to 200 years... But, and listen carefully... 12,000 years from now? You are NOT going to be In NY, NJ, Or Mich, unless you are standing on an ICE sheet about a mile deep. And for most of that year? It will not be warm and the CLIMATE WILL BE CHANGING!  As to the mini ice age from 1300 to 1850. That is well documented that the Sun went into what is called a GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM during this time. Less pressure means colder temps. This is why we freeze during ice ages. We have less pressure from solar mass ejections hitting us most of the year when we are farther away in our yearly rotation around the sun. Less pressure from the sun on earths water vapor air and you get FREEZING WORLD WIDE TEMPS! To be clear. It is pressure from the sun that causes climate to change. Man may have warmed the planet. But nature will cool  them off no matter how much heat they produce. You are not going to out due the cold of space or the heat of the sun even if you used the whole mass of the earth. Stop with the fear mongering. It gets old. 10,000 feet above your head it is freezing right now even with the sun out full all day, why?

{"cid": "Ugze3dnQpd7AKwCqC2J4AaABAg", "text": "Oh yeah. One more thing. As saltwater around the poles get more fresh from the melting glaciers and ice sheets, the salinity will drop, which, will result in the water being able to freeze at a higher temperature (100% pure water freezes at 0 degrees celsius, obviously). Then the ice sheets will reflect alot of the sunlight back, and they will form a solid platform where snow can sit, which will reflect even more sunlight back. That will also cool down the earth even more. And as the gulf stream is weakened from the previous cooling of water from the ice being melted, the amount of warm water being able to hit the poles is reduced a lot, which also, will cool down the poles even more, to the point where sea water with higher salinity will freeze more easy because of the lower temperatures, which will create ice and do the same exact thing as I mentioned first. \n\n\nSo in theory, the poles will get MUCH colder for a period, and the average temperature on high latitudes of the northern and southern hemisphere will also get colder. But the equator will heat up, because the warm water around there has nowhere to go as explained in the video, which in the end will reverse most of this (For a period). \n\n\nI am located in Denmark btw, and another thing about why Europe is on average much warmer than America, is because we have sea (Island) climate, instead of continental climate (like the USA has). The sea around Europe, (Which is also warmer than that of the USA at same latitudes), will cool down the land in the summer, but heat it up in the winter. Oh yeah and the main mountain ranges here in Europe are also mostly running from west to east (Alps, pyrenees, dinarian alps, scottish highlands, and some parts of the scandinavian mountains), which will block the amount of cold air being transferred from the poles, to mainland Europe because of pressure systems building up on the north side of the mountains. That also explains why we usually get the coldest cold fronts from the east (Siberia/ Russia), and not from the Scandinavian peninsula (We also get cold fronts from there, or Denmark does atleast). Oh yeah and the average altitude in continental north Europe (North of the alps, south of the Scaninavian Peninsula) here is also a bit lower than the US.\n\n\nI am not a scientist. I have just been thinking a lot of this, and been using common knowledge and sense. \n\n\nForgot to mention a thing. It would be really nice if tou could please leave a like. I spent a lot of time on this comment, and it would be kinda sad to see it getting lost in the comments. Oh another thing.

Less rainwater means less flooding, unless you weren't afraid of that in the first place. More rainwater means cheaper water, unless it's already free because you get too much. Warmer temperatures means shorter winters, i.e. longer growing seasons. The problem is that the biosphere prefers to have a few centuries to adapt to change and we're already straining many species, many of which we already strained past what they could adapt much faster than what we generally see in the fossil record outside of extinction events. We tend to like the biosphere for the most part and don't particularly care to find out how much of it we can remove before we have to start supporting ourselves biologically. In addition, different weather patterns means that we're going to have to change our infrastructure all over the world to deal with whatever the new climates become. You start having more droughts, that means more water storage in reservoirs. More flooding, better drainage, and perhaps the need to construct large pipes that take excess water to the places with droughts. More storms, better methods of dealing with them so you don't have a refugee crisis on the coasts every storm season. All of that is expensive, and especially for poorer nations, they're just going to have to change their lifestyle to cope while richer nations like America are going to need to deal with higher costs associated with living the way we want to where we want to. Now personally, I think that some of these solutions should be undertaken even if Global Warming weren't a thing. Honestly, it's pitiful how poorly we deal with major storms that hit cities. But yea, the story of Global Warming for the most part is, we know that temperatures on average are going to rise, and we're not seeing too many positive outcomes and plenty detrimental ones, but exact effects on places are still subject to many things we are less certain about. In a way it's like the fact that we can understand how the universe is likely to end despite the fact that predicting human society past a few decades is currently impossible as there are way too many potential technologies each of which could have major effects on society.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Treviisolion", "channel": "UCPVkTk1mNlc7UGtsTSa0chg", "votes": "12", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZSdp74_3orzhsDMmlUakP4u1_wdlS42eYfHd_2Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There have been a few periods in which the world could have been ice free for a few thousand years, but I have not found any indication that we know for certain. Those were periods where either global temperatures and CO2 concentrations were well above current levels, or the geography lended to a very smooth global temperature with the poles not being much colder than the tropics. Examples include parts of the Cambrian, Ordovician, Cambrian, and Cretaceous. CO2 concentrations in those times were anywhere from 800 ppm to 4400 ppm. The only one that seems reasonable for humans to reach is the lower 800 ppm. I also have yet to see any reliable source saying the glaciers will take any less than several thousand years to melt even if it gets warm enough all of them will (which I also haven’t seen, rather that they’ll be greatly reduced and reach an equilibrium with much less area covered under worst cases). I’m not certain why you bring up solar wind as oxygen and carbon are trace elements in them, the amount of solar wind itself is fairly minuscule itself on the timelines we talk about when talking about Global Warming and what we can do about it, and it’s pretty reduced by our magnetic field, so feel free to illustrate why you brought it up. The increased tectonic activity is new that I hadn’t heard of before, though the principle makes sense. Doing a quick search is bringing only a few studies, so hopefully we can research this more so we can better determine the exact effects. That said, your solution of producing no heat is unfortunately not a solution. Humans themselves produce waste heat, and killing ourselves would doom Earth to burn in about 900 million years when the planet is cooked by our aging sun. My original point, is that exact future effects of Global Warming are still not 100% certain, but they generally aren’t good, and that we need to find ways to deal with them especially as many of them we’d have to deal with anyways even without Global Warming (hurricanes have been around for much longer than we’ve had to worry about Global Warming, and even if we solve Global Warming that doesn’t solve Hurricanes still occasionally coming and destroying coastal cities). Furthermore the point is that humans will adapt. That’s not necessarily a good thing. Humans will adapt to any situation, good or bad. Prevent what we can, fix what we can’t, and Mitigate the rest. Ultimately though, the reason why we’ve decided Global Warming is bad, is because it harms people. The easiest solution would be to create a virus that kills off all of humanity, but in that context then Global Warming is no longer a problem, it’s just a weird tiny blip on the Earth’s paleoclimate. For anyone else who has read to this point: If you are saying that Global Warming will end humanity then I call bullshit. If you are not and think that I’m understating Global Warming, then I feel the statement Millions will die doesn’t apparently mean anything.

You appear to be predicting that we’re in large danger of turning Earth into a second Venus (or to at least produce a climate never seen before when actual reports are that we’re producing a climate not seen for millions of years, not never), and well, I have seen no credible source indicating either of those except yours, and forgive me, but your credentials of random YouTube commenter don’t exactly lead me to believe you over the majority of Climate Scientists. Also I did the math, assuming that the Sun has radiated about 5 billion kg of mass per second for the last billion years, that any mass headed our way was able to make the entire journey, and that the magnetosphere hasn’t blocked any of the heavier elements that reached us, and that a whopping .1% of all solar wind is carbon and oxygen in the right amounts to produce carbon dioxide (2 oxygen atoms for every carbon atom as apparently we’re specifying stupidly obvious stuff), then we’re talking about 600 metric tons over the course of a billion years. Let’s say that I seriously lowballed it and round it to 10,000 metric tons. That sounds like a lot, until you realize that the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere weighs about 3 trillion metric tons. Now I am just a random YouTube commentator so it’s certainly possible I did my calculations wrong especially as they were fairly back of hand stuff. And if you got even an article or something that backs up the idea that we’re gaining enough carbon and oxygen to make any real dent over any scales other than the largest of geological then that’ll be interesting, but so far it doesn’t seem we’ll be hitting even 1000 ppm CO2 concentrations, when Earth has had a whopping 4400 ppm CO2 concentrations during the Cambrian era. That’s not to say it isn’t a problem, but Earth will survive, it’s a big uncaring rock orbiting an uncaring sun, that will kill us all if we let it in a measly 900 million years, in a vast uncaring universe that does not care because it isn’t intelligent or even alive. The Earth will stay that same orbiting rock, until the Sun engulfs it or goes SuperNova. The life on it unless we blow up the surface with nukes, will still be going until photosynthesis fails in 900 million years when temperatures are expected to rise to such a degree (from the sun’s expansion and increased luminosity as it ages, not humans at that point), and we’re talking 50 to several hundred of degrees warmer, with current projections of what humans are likely to cause generally maxing out at 4 degrees celsius under almost unrealistically bad worst case scenarios (we’re currently looking at more likely 2 degrees). Until you have anybody to corroborate your claims, good day. And perhaps you should do some research, and maybe start with the IPCC and their reports as they’re the ones tasked with summarizing all the data we’ve gathered, presenting it in such unambiguous terms, they’ve provided a list of percentages that correspond with specific phrases, and indicate everything from how certain we are that Global Warming is real, whether it’s primarily of Anthropogenic origin, and what the likely effects are going to be as well as what we can do to mitigate it and prevent it, as well as what we’ll need to do to adapt in the cases where we don’t. \n\nI also want to say, that not all your suggestions on stopping Global Warming are terrible, just that you seem to have some crazy theories I have no idea from where you got them, and I’m done with this conversation unless it’ll actually result in something actually productive instead of us having to pride ourselves on knowing basic physics that anyone who wants to discuss Global Warming should be aware of.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Treviisolion", "channel": "UCPVkTk1mNlc7UGtsTSa0chg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZSdp74_3orzhsDMmlUakP4u1_wdlS42eYfHd_2Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Especially when it comes to the Northern Irish border.\n\nThe current quagmire of indecision was a 100% inevitable after the vote decision.

It was madness to go into the negotions with no idea what the country wants to get out of the separation agreement. Decisions like soft brexit or hard brexit or how to deal with Northern Ireland, should have been made before the negotiations started. But since these issues were not settlend within the UK, they couldn't possibly be settled in the separation agreement. And when Theresa May finally defined a position (the Chequers-Plan) - one and a half years late - she lost about half her cabinet. It's as though someone went to a car-dealership to negotiate a lease with no clues whether he (or she) wants to lease a car, a lorry or a tractor. Had the UK government done this properly and defined its goal before it started the process, the UK wouldn't be in that \"quagmire of indecision\" now.\n\n\nWhen the negotiations started, Michel Barnier complained publically how poorly the british delegation was prepared, how little interest his the counterpart David Davis seemed to take (the man couldn't even be bothered to be present the entire time) and that the delegations leaders didn't seem to understand the consequences of their positions. Davis is a brexit hardliner and in retrospect it seems he wasn't negotiating in good faith but deliberately sabotaging the negotations to make sure there wouldn't be a successful separation agreement, thus guarantueeing a diamond hard brexit.  Having someone oversee the negotiations of the separation agreement who wants to cut all ties and doesn't understand why a separation agreement is needed in the first place was a royally stupid move.\nNeither of those issues have anything to do with how complex the matter is. They have to do with infighting due to poor leadership and the failure to make decisions when they needed to be made. The EU has gone out of its way to protect the British people from the idiocy of their leaders.\n\n\nI'm not sure about Spain. But the Netherlands were a founding member of the predecessor organizations of the EU. They have plenty of experience with multilateral negotiations and coming to a consensus within their own country. The fact that Netherlands didn't have a global empire from which draw delusions of grandeur that led lots of Brits to believe the EU would be a pushover and the UK everything they want. So I'm pretty sure, if they had decided to leave the EU they would have known that there was plenty to discuss and decide before article 50 is triggered.\nThe issue there is: British political culture is based on competition and a \"winner takes it all\" approach which is fundamentally incompatible with the more consensus-oriented politcal culture on the continent. British politicians are not used to compromise; most of them see compromise as a sign of weakness and failure.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "MrAranton", "channel": "UCDQEALJIlDemLU5r6pGuLXw", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSmg89Vi5qtX7fvX7mAk-DzkyjaLgwj9U0DGQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I wasn't talking about all Brits, but Brexiters or even more particularly those people in government who felt they could get away with half-assed negotiations. Whether you like it or not: Brexiters did make arguments based on post imperial delusions of grandeur - like \"The EU needs Britain (and access to its market) more than the other way around, so desperately the UK will be able to dictate terms and get all the benefits of EU membership with none of the resposibilities\" or \"once the UK leaves the Britain will be able to negotiate trade deals with the entire world - as though the entire world just waited for that and would make getting a trade agreement with 65 million consumer Britain their top priority...\" And enough people bought into that crap to give \"leave\" a majority. Though, granted; It's possible there were people who voted leave just to give Cameron the finger, not because they actually wanted to leave the EU. We both know how close the referndum was and that almost half the population didn't buy into into the nationalistic \"better off alone\" rhetoric - at least not enough to actually vote \"leave\". I thought that was so obvious it didn't need mentioning.\nThe point I was trying to make is a very different one: The people in Britain should be aware how badly the government bungled the process and not let them evade the consequences because \"leaving the EU is hard\".

Do you want to know what happened the last time that drastic an increase occurred? There was a mass extinction event. The time before that? Another mass extinction event. In fact the only time in the history of Earth that there has been a more sudden increase in CO2 levels in Earths history was after the eruption of a mega volcano that caused the largest extinction event in the planets history, The Great Dying/Permian extinction, which wiped out 98% of all life on Earth including all advanced land based life forms. The natural cycles that you refer to saw CO2 vary between 180ppm and 300ppm.\n\nIt seems we have a rather different definition of what constitutes a serious shift in the atmosphere composition.\n\nBesides all of that even if you take climate change out of the debate entirely a shift towards renewable and clean energy is the logical option. I'm sure you don't like having polluted air to breath and water to drink do you? How about sea life, I doubt you want that to get wiped out by overfishing and dumping plastic into the ocean? Or forests, do you like those? Well if you do then you should support clean energy and sustainable farming.\n\nSimply put there is no cohesive argument against clean energy and a more sustainable use of the planets resources even if you dismiss climate change.

The fact that it already happened without humans (Multiple times...... More times than we probably know and before extinction event's actually happened) begs the question \"is it us doing this\". My point isn't that co2 is not building up, but that there's cycles which allow for co2 to be released at a higher rate. The fact that our planet is warming because of the sun, allows for more vegetative growth and so more co2 to be released........ And that cycle goes on and on until it doesn't and all hell breaks loose. Cycles of the sun have a far bigger impact on our global climate than the use of and release of carbon by humans. You're taking that whole number and blaming it on humans when there is far more at work than just humans on our planet. Whats above us and below us counts too. You mention that the last time there was a drastic change in the amount of co2 being released was because of an eruption - but failed to mention that said eruption caused 100,000 Billion tons of co2 to be released in a short period of time(which is what in ppm??(Parts Per Million)).  Obviously very deadly. Comparing what we do (with incorrect information) and that eruption is of a very impudent manner. \n\r\n\r\n\nIt seems that way because it most definitely is that way. \n\nAs you may have seen, the renewable energy sector has taken a hit throughout this winter and will continue to do so as the world gets colder. Deforestation isn't even happening on that big of a scale taking into consideration how big our world is and how many trees/forest's and all different kinds of plant life there is. Once upon a time (during human times) The Sahara was green. How big are Russian forest's? African? South American? American? European? How many trees and forests do they all have that are untouched. The world changes and so do facts..... Cycles on the other hand, they have proven to be continuously persistent. HOWEVER..... I do agree about plastic in our oceans and over-fishing which steps have been taken and laws put in place to minimize this, so that isn't even a part of this conversation right here. You've gone right off track. And how we deal with fossil fuels and natural gasses needs attending to, I agree. There have been unforgivable mistakes that have taken place and will continue to do so if we don't have pipelines and other means of transport for these goods. I say, we should use both energies (nonrenewable and renewable) to the best of our capabilities. \n\nP.s, I have two legs to stand on.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Dean Andrew MacInnes", "channel": "UCE2aRjy4UB3WikgSX-sWyXw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRQJ-C1SsL2kth1_8ifsYrAvY7X0YIumJFoVQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It gets confined by the South American continental shelf and then the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and then flows north.

The return system starts under the sea ice in the Arctic ocean where it sinks and stays in each Arctic ocean basin for 400 years or so.  Then it finally flows over the choke points out in the north Atlantic (at the very bottom bottom because it is the most dense water there is on the planet) and it flows all the way to the south Atlantic where it runs into the Antarctic bottom water and slowly surfaces somewhere in the south Atlantic.  So stop the winds, stp the rotation of the Earth, stop the 180 days of darkness in the Arctic, tilt the Earth differently and you can stop the AMOC.
