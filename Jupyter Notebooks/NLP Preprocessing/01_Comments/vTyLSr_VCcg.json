{"cid": "UgyN3QBdr76NdfgzKRd4AaABAg", "text": "There are huge integrity stakes with the UNs Security Councils inertia, it is a political stalemate whereby Russia's support of strongman Hassan and Israeli loathing of any improved Syrian political progress is a ground swell  of US led military backing. That support has seen a litany of disastrous results for successive US administration's, from the Clintons, Bush, Obama and now Trump. The biggest failure in the Syrian conflict is political will to be able to refrain from Israeli fears the complex strain of decades long villification of Syrian soveriegnty and the very crux of the Middle East problem, Syria like Iran, Iraq, Libya all over the decades of strife and conflict sought too Nationalise there banking system and there vast oil resources, effectively free from the influence of Western Power and Israel's International Banking systems. That with the percieved threat of an economy that can support science, technology and massive arms build up is the real reason why Syria can not rise from the ashes, border clashes between Kurdish population by Turkish military, massive oil reserves and Russian military placement, makes the Syrian problem vastly complex. Yet there is a solution and Syria, Russia, Turkey, Israel can do it because the world economy needs this part of the world stable let the Russian and Turkish economy embrace Syria's potential, stop Israeli meddling and let Trump organise trade on a scale unprecedented for the American economy. The politics do not have to align both Turkey and Russia have stable robust economies, they are testament to progressive stable political systems, the West needs to expand its global trade and interact with the same aspirations rebuild the world economy and rebuild nations, demilitarisation can occur with economic recovery.   Trump can foresee the necessity of political solutions not military intervention, Russia is as much a global partner in solving the crisis. It's time for a change and if the UN security Council can not resolve Israeli intolerance, create a new model of progression.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Ian Mac Dougall", "channel": "UCUXwRsxvcAh1wRCTFET_Jbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQHNJDS-29qSZhjZMhG0vG-1xH-fxd6A0riQuKr=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyTzifj1EPBWB3bCip4AaABAg", "text": "Thank you, Mr Secretary General, your excellencies, ladies and gentleman, and distinguished guests. I‚Äôm honored to be here today, I stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen, one of the 400,000 people who marched in the streets of New York on Sunday, and the billions of others around the world who want to solve our climate crisis.\nAs an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems.\nI believe humankind has looked at climate change in that same way: as if it were a fiction, happening to someone else‚Äôs planet, as if pretending that climate change wasn‚Äôt real would somehow make it go away.\n\nBut I think we know better than that. Every week, we‚Äôre seeing new and undeniable climate events, evidence that accelerated climate change is here now.¬†We know that droughts are intensifying, our oceans are warming and acidifying, with methane plumes rising up from beneath the ocean floor. We are seeing extreme weather events, increased temperatures, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets melting at unprecedented rates, decades ahead of scientific projections.\nNone of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria. It is fact. The scientific community knows it, Industry and governments know it, even the United States military knows it. The chief of the US navy‚Äôs Pacific command, admiral Samuel Locklear, recently said that climate change is our single greatest security threat.\nMy Friends, this body ‚Äì perhaps more than any other gathering in human history ‚Äì now faces that difficult task. You can make history ... or be vilified by it.\n\nTo be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car. This disaster has grown BEYOND the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action.\nI am not a scientist, but I don‚Äôt need to be. Because the world‚Äôs scientific community has spoken, and they have given us our prognosis, if we do not act together, we will surely perish.\nNow is our moment for action.\nWe need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions, and eliminate government subsidies for coal, gas, and oil companies. We need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free-market economy, they don‚Äôt deserve our tax dollars, they deserve our scrutiny.

{"cid": "Ugwnp2zavaXU8lgLkCt4AaABAg", "text": "Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General, your excellencies, ladies and gentleman, and distinguished guests. I‚Äôm honored to be here today, I stand before you not as an expert but as a concerned citizen, one of the 400,000 people who marched in the streets of New York on Sunday, and the billions of others around the world who want to solve our climate crisis.\nAs an actor I pretend for a living. I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems.\nI believe mankind has looked at climate change in that same way: as if it were a fiction, as if pretending that climate change wasn‚Äôt real would somehow make it go away.\nBut I think we know better than that. Every week , we‚Äôre seeing new and undeniable climate events, evidence that accelerated climate change is here right now. Droughts are intensifying, our oceans are acidifying, with methane plumes rising up from the ocean floor. We are seeing extreme weather events, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets melting at unprecedented rates, decades ahead of scientific projections.\nNone of this is rhetoric, and none of it is hysteria. It is fact. The scientific community knows it, industry knows it, governments know it, even the United States military knows it. The Chief of the U.S. Navy‚Äôs Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Locklear, recently said that climate change is our single greatest security threat.\nMy Friends, this body ‚Äì perhaps more than any other gathering in human history ‚Äì now faces this difficult, but achievable task. You can make history‚Ä¶ or be vilified by it.\nTo be clear, this is not about telling people to change their light bulbs or buy a hybrid car. This disaster has grown BEYOND the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries, and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action.\nNow must be our moment for action.\nWe need to put a pricetag on carbon emissions, and eliminate government subsidies for oil, coal and gas companies. We need to end the free ride that industrial polluters have been given in the name of a free-market economy, they do not deserve our tax dollars, they deserve our scrutiny. For the economy itself will die if our eco-systems collapse.\nThe good news is that renewable energy is not only achievable but good economic policy.\nThis is not a partisan debate; it is a human one. Clean air and a livable climate are inalienable human rights. And solving this crisis is not a question of politics, it is a question of our own survival.\nThis is the most urgent of times, and the most urgent of messages.\nHonored delegates, leaders of the world, I pretend for a living. But you do not.\nThe people made their voices heard on Sunday around the world and the momentum will not stop. But now it is YOUR turn, the time to answer humankind‚Äôs greatest challenge is now.\nWe beg of you to face it with courage. And honesty. Thank you.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Êú¨Ëó§Á¥ÄËä±", "channel": "UCjgQlG6BOW8uGaPDod8tgvA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTt64aQN_kqHCFCkZ464EaM3bqc4mNzr2eOqp9drQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Back when everyone thought the Earth was flat there is a few that were called crazy. Nowadays anyone that says global warming is a made-up myth it's called crazy. The only people that say global warming is real or scientists that are paid by the government. The Earth is only warmed two degrees in the last five thousand years. The Earth is gone through changes of the Ice Age and has fluctuated throughout the years before mankind was even here. The UN and Elites of the world are using global warming to roll out their new Urban agenda, agenda 21 and going green to establish a one nation ruling as stated in the UN new Urban agendas. This is all just a power move to depopulate the world as also stated in the new Urban agenda. The easiest way to explain a lot of weather changes is HAARP. The US government is using Tesla's work to control and manipulate weather. Nothing in this statement is false. Everything I have stated is true and openly admitted on all sides. When the government started heavily rolling out the HARP program the scientists working on it openly admitted that we are working on weather Warfare in weather manipulation. I hope more people wake up to this BS. It seems like President Trump is opposing everything the UN is trying to do. The evil tactics they're using all boiled down to one word.

When he was filming here in western Canada in the middle of winter he told the whole world that he experienced global warming first hand when the temperature rose from well below zero degrees to well above zero in a matter of minutes brought on by strong westerly winds. He called the winds, \"Chinook\" winds and he told the whole world that the locals were \"terrified\" of the Chinook winds...lol..well...hmmmm...I have lived in the area of where he was filming for almost 60 years and I am very familiar with the Chinook winds so i will tell \"the whole world\" the truth about them.  The word \"Chinook\" is a native Canadian word first introduced hundreds of years ago by the local natives and I mean the natives that came here before the white man...ya...those natives. Chinook winds are perfectly natural and have been happening for centuries if not longer and have nothing to do with global warming and I can assure you, no one in their right mind (so that excludes all climate change alarmists) is afraid of the Chinook winds....no one. Who the hell wouldn't appreciate a nice warm breeze blowing through the area to melt all the snow and warm you up for a short period until winter blasts back again, time and time again until spring finally rolls around. We love the Chinook winds around here...we all do. The Chinook winds occur when warm air from the Pacific Ocean blows over the Rocky Mountains and displaces the ambient cold air increasing the outside temperature by several degrees in a very short period of time and there is a very nice chinook arch over the mountains when this happens. Ask any local if they like to see the chinook arch over the mountains and I can assure you they will smile and say yes, bring on the chinook winds...lol..Decrapio..OMG...would you really listen to someone who has absolutely no clue about the science or the facts and this one instance sealed the deal for me on Decrapios knowledge of the science or lack there of. I mean, he can talk all he wants about any other scientific explaination and I might believe him except when I live in the area he is talking about (on another interview, not this one) I realize he has no clue.

Factory farming is disastrous for the environment. Humanity needs to go back to small local farms that provide food for people in the area where healthy animals feed on their natural diets and re fertilize the land without the need for importing massive amounts of grains and soy.¬†\n\n\nAlso I do agree with what you say about people generally eating way too many animal foods. There is no need to eat meat 3x a day or drink 3 quarts of milk a day as seems to be the norm for many in this insane society.¬†\n\n\nIn my opinion we are just too many on this earth which means there are also many more twisted ,selfish,lazy,useless and self destructive individuals who do not care for what happens to this world or future generations as can clearly be seen by reading some of these comments.

We do not eat animal foods because killing and eating them has anything to do with justice.

Many people will become very sick when they abstain from animal foods completely. Because their nutritional types require these foods. This is a rational and logical reason. Why would it not be considered acceptable under human morales when we only take what we need to stay healthy as all sorts of organisms around the globe do in their natural habitats. I am not for mass factory farming of animals. This practice is what's truly disgusting. Animals should be allowed to live in healthy clean environments while consuming their natural foods and be put down in the most humane manner possible. Murdering people in hatred and destroying entire ecosystems to sathe ones excessive greed and hunger for power is another thing entirely.

I have been on any vegan diet you can imagine for years believing I didn't need to eat animal foods until I almost died of malnourishment. I eat animals only to remain healthy and for me that's worth killing them for. Just as any other creature in nature will kill in order to remain healthy and survive. I don't care much for sacrificing this or that food because I enjoy it or it's convenient unlike 85% of americans who overconsume certain foods just because they are addicts without considering the ramifications for their health or for the world we live in. You can make delicious recipes out of any diet. It's just a matter of adjusting. So yes I agree with you when we talk about the majority of the populace. In any case from a purely nutritional perspective I do not agree with or think it is necessary nor a good idea to force people to go vegan in order to drastically reduce greenhouse gasses. I think it's more important to focus on radically changing the unsustainable manner of producing food that now revolves largely around a system that seeks to generate the most profit and not what's best for our planet.

Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood).

Therefore we're not under the law of the old testament. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.\nAnd that takes us back to John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood). That's the gospel.

We had a casual ¬†conversation back then and I found out the inspite of being illiterate he knew about all farming. I realized how dedicated he was in his business, I must say a master in farming methods and practices. But surprisingly he did not know who the president of India is. At that time I realized that though this man is illiterate he is able to sustain his family and that is what is needed. But when I switch on the Television I see disturbing images. Every country in the world is trying to secure its future nothing else and all this is creating an arms race. Fortunately with gods grace all our world leaders are highly stable (Mentally). A leader according to me should be like a fatherly figure. One who treats every citizen of his country as if they are his own children. People experience calm, happiness and peaceful atmosphere in his presence. That according to me are the characteristics of a great leader. But what if one fine day ¬†someone who is not that stable mentally becomes a leader.Because day by day the comfort level of individuals is increasing. Why was the united nations created ? We youngsters expect our leaders to sit together and talk and understand the strengths and weaknesses of every nation and provided them with a fitting opportunity.If ¬†people are truthful to themselves and others they need not fear anyone.

Has anyone thought what a 12 mile earthquake is going to do to Mother Earth, followed by a 12 mile HIGH tidal wave along with the melting of most of the earths crust due to friction along with the release of methane from both poles capped by the ice for millions of years along with the melting of methane hydrates worldwide. Conservatively scientists say our atmosphere is going to be nine parts methane and one part current. Thats only talking about methane hydrates not 12 miles deep methane filled polar caps nor abrupt heating of soil which currently caps methane over a huge area. The 1906 san andreas fault earthquake moved the earth laterally about 160 feet, can you imagine 68000 foot vertical movement followed by ocean wave just as high or higher followed by melting of most of the earths crust followed by ninety five percent methane atmosphere along with fifty thousand to one hundred lighting strikes per day. Assuming none of this happens, our waterways, all of them are grossly contaminated by fukushima, cesium has now spread to everyone on earth, most will die of cancer within five or ten years plus our major fishing sources are all below ten percent, considered extinction levels for those who don't know. Our major source of air, plankton about a year ago was at four or five percent of their former levels due to acidification of our oceans. The amazon, where we get the remainder of our air is now just about extinct as well, we are losing thousands of acres a day there, just check out a view from space to see the huge 24 hour a day plume of smoke as we destroy our last major remaining source of oxygen generation.\n\nHomo Sapiens are truly remarkable, symbiotic is something we live and embrace without even thinking about it. How does anyone expect to survive when Mother Earth breaks and burns as hot as the sun then explodes into space, possibly igniting it taking out the entire fucking universe, I wonder, Mother Earth wonders, Mother Creator wonders and Father God wonders. Hope you hugs your significant others every day, our time is just about up, iminently.\n\nFor those Morons at this late stage still denying climate change, shut up and go back to basic science class, at about the kindergarten level because thats all you can handle. When a substance is changing state its temperature stays more or less constant, lets say the artic ice as it melts keeping the rest of the world cool as it does so, once a substance is done melting heat increases significantly until it reaches another change of state, in this case now water only to steam. For those morons take a glass of water, fill it with ice then expose it to heat, as long as there is ice in the glass the water will stay more or less at a constant cold temperature, once the ice has melted do you see how rapidly the water temperature rises, thats us here on earth, IDIOTS> ¬† ¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Allan Barr", "channel": "UCkIMhLTA2lFlksHvypVMg_Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSRJfkAWJcNSP3bcKaK1jT2yQjEQ7298wDq9qr4DQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgjZPKCsYLzSDXgCoAEC", "text": "Saying leaders of the world don't pretend for a living is a bit laughable. ¬†World leaders pretend to care about the lower and middle class, they could care less. ¬†They are just acting themselves, putting on a face to deceive people into thinking they care. ¬†\n\nWhile I think global warming or whatever you call it is propaganda, I do believe it's irresponsible to damage our environment, and it leaves scars on our souls. ¬†Unfortunately the biggest culprits are big industry who spill toxic waste into rivers, oil spills, nuclear power that can cause catastrophic damage when compromised a la Fukushima, spraying chemicals in the air which are supposedly helping with cooling (yeah right). ¬†The problem is the powers that be, who have the potential to make an actual impact, don't give a shit and will never change anything, no matter how many emphatic speeches are given, because they are the ones orchestrating it. ¬†They applaud the emphatic speeches, and are the ones who put people like Leo up here to tug at everyone's heart-strings. ¬†\n\nBut it's just like how the NBA \"cares\" about kids, throw a commercial on with Lebron James helping children out at a local school, but then go on to be a \"role model\" that tells kids fame, money and power are the most important things because the whole lifestyle revolves around that. ¬†Watching a bunch of spoiled millionaire's who are worshiped like gods for putting a ball in a hoop, have carte blanche to get away with any legal trouble, who engage in a bunch of petty gossip on twitter and play the entertainment game is one of the worst things you can put in children's minds. ¬†It's a complete contraction of itself by telling them these are \"great\" people and enough of them buy it, including myself growing up.\n\nTo really change, it needs to start on a personal level, not buy so much crap we don't need, stop supporting big industry the best we can, and write to them to tell them why, turn off the television, pay no attention to politicians, boycott sports and all the other poison for our minds and work on making our family's stronger, not upgrading everytime a new f'n iPhone comes out, or giving your 12 year old one so he can show off to his friends and enslave his own mind because he's not mature enough to handle it. ¬†We need to start producing things like food for ourselves if possible, or having some tangible skill, being pro-active in our own education and health, learn how to cope with life without pills and pharmaceutical drugs, and investing in the future by exposing all the BS in the world to our children so they don't fall for fancy speech's by millonaire's and billionaire's on how to save the world, instead of raising them in a world of fantasy where it's only cute things and puppy dogs. ¬†We need to teach kids to value integrity and not going for the quick buck, or the easy solution. ¬†Teach them critical thinking and stop promoting that going to college is what education is all about. ¬†What it's all about is enslaving them to the debt system, most kids aren't mature enough to know why they are in college in the first place. ¬†\n\nI don't care how \"educated\" you are, whether it's Princeton, Yale or you're an astrophysicist, if you can't see that people like Obama or any other politician is just a paid actor, you're ignorant. ¬†I'm not saying anyone who goes to college is an idiot, not at all, it's more important to understand WHY you are really there in the first place, and I think that most people who are there who can't see through the most basic logic of someone says something, and does the complete opposite, that means they are a liar and you shouldn't rely on them. ¬†The problem we keep looking to leaders who have never historically done anything but work for the elite, while knowing all the clever tricks to make most people buy into their bullshit and make the masses victims of the Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nI'm not making a judgement on Mr. DiCaprio. ¬†I just think he's being used as a pawn. ¬†I'm not one to say he should put his money where his mouth is and sell off his fortune to help the world, he's probably doing a lot more than many people do, and is doing what he feels is right and is in a position to spread a message he believes in, or maybe he's fully aware that what he is doing is full of lies and is a conniving bastard. ¬†I don't know him personally nor his intentions, and I've never seen him say anything to make me think less of him from the little I've seen in his public life, though I'm not one to follow celebrity's lives. ¬†The point is, no matter how inspiring the speech may be, or what his true intentions are behind it, he's allowed to that podium for a reason: Because he's a useful idiot. ¬†I don't mean than in a vulgar manner but more a sad manner, because when things that are positive and inspirational are just being used by a deceptive and sinister agenda engineered by puppet masters who truly don't give a shit about anyone but themselves and preservation of their wealth and power at the expense of the people, it's one of the worst

Conservatively scientists say our atmosphere is going to be nine parts methane and one part current. Thats only talking about methane hydrates not 12 miles deep methane filled polar caps nor abrupt heating of soil which currently caps methane over a huge area. The 1906 san andreas fault earthquake moved the earth laterally about 160 feet, can you imagine 68000 foot vertical movement followed by ocean wave just as high or higher followed by melting of most of the earths crust followed by ninety five percent methane atmosphere along with fifty thousand to one hundred lighting strikes per day. Assuming none of this happens, our waterways, all of them are grossly contaminated by fukushima, cesium has now spread to everyone on earth, most will die of cancer within five or ten years plus our major fishing sources are all below ten percent, considered extinction levels for those who don't know. Our major source of air, plankton about a year ago was at four or five percent of their former levels due to acidification of our oceans.

When a substance is changing state its temperature stays more or less constant, lets say the artic ice as it melts keeping the rest of the world cool as it does so, once a substance is done melting heat increases significantly until it reaches another change of state, in this case now water only to steam. For those morons take a glass of water, fill it with ice then expose it to heat, as long as there is ice in the glass the water will stay more or less at a constant cold temperature, once the ice has melted do you see how rapidly the water temperature rises, thats us here on earth, IDIOTS> ¬† ¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Allan Barr", "channel": "UCkIMhLTA2lFlksHvypVMg_Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSRJfkAWJcNSP3bcKaK1jT2yQjEQ7298wDq9qr4DQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We had temperatures much lower than the currents ones, as well as much higher ones. At one point, in the Jurassic era, CO2 levels were 5 to 10 times the ones of today, and yet, lower temperatures.\nThe big and the little ice age. Were they because there weren't enough green house gases? What has been changing temperatures since the beginning of what we know as climate? Certainly not green house gases, let alone man-made ones.\n\nWe do need, however, to reduce or eliminate entirely our CO2 emissions. Not for climate sake. but for our own direct one.\n\nI encourage people to research the impact that cosmic rays have on our climate. When one does, one finds a direct and clear correlation between the amount of cosmic rays absorbed by Earth and its climate.\n\nPlease, take a look at this graph and, in the interests of fair information, test its veracity with information from other sources.\nhttp://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/cosmic-ray/svensen-cosmic-rays-tropospheric-temperature-crop.gif\n\nhttp://joannenova.com.au/2010/02/if-carbon-didnt-warm-us-what-did/", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "vacomments", "channel": "UCKawnQtsVn0f_BFx4okwRcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRMOlqt9cD7UqgrAJJeP6ogGY9BueZq6lcTTA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also the question that these climatologists responded to was¬†something like this, \"Do you believe that human activities could have contributed to climate change...\"? Now that¬†is the kind of question that everyone can¬†answer yes to, even the most hardened sceptics would probably agree with that. The problem is with the language used when the results of such surveys are released to the media. That is when the subtle, but dangerous alterations are made in the narrative which distort the true findings.\nAs far as the old smoking chestnut goes, this really is just an attempt to dismiss sceptic arguments without addressing the issue. The simple reality is that there are thousands of scientists worldwide who don't agree with the catastrophic scenario¬†ideas being actively hyped by some.¬†Richard Lindzen [MIT], John¬†Christy[U of Col], Patrick Michaels, are just a few and there are many more.\nIn regards to the laws of physics, the Earth is not exempt from them, that is not¬†the argument. The question is HOW MUCH of the warming that we have observed is due to CO2, and how much is natural. The IPCC modellers¬†have assumed that ALL of the warming of the last 50 years is from CO2.

Only the law of banks and governments are not to undermine, because either the bank will take us all, or the government put us in jail. Every year, the governments of all countries approve billions in military spending instead of the science and technology that will solve the current problems with contaminated environment, cancer, Alzheimer's, Ebola, drought, famine and thousands of other risks that kill people around the world.\nHelium-3 - Moon\nIt is at your fingertips, clean energy for the entire world for 10 000 years, for all without exception, enough to give scientists, engineers a free hand and the means to achieve that objective, and they certainly will not disappoint.

But certainly I am in agreement that it must change. Make no mistake, however, this will not be easy nor cheap. As finding ways to make alternatives work will take decades to transition to. As even what we have today, it's still out of reach for many people.\n\nI myself would love to put solar panels on my roof, but that's 30 grand. I would love to have an electric car (say a Tesla) but that's 100 grand. I'm not rich. I can only do so much. Beyond that, we need solutions to tackle beyond the consumers share.

Hence, we have to design economic policies in a way so that doing the right thing ALSO becomes the economically feasible or even profitable thing, which is only possible if all relevant institutions and companies are equally compelled, by law, to meet certain standards. We must not continue to frame the climate change issue as a fight or a blame game between the smart vs. the ignorant, or the responsible vs. the greedy.

Capitalism incentivizes cooperation and co-creation. The markets in all first world nations are actually either fascist or socialistic. They incentivize greed and corruption. And government is the cause of it all.\n\nGovernment is the problem. Without government force, all businesses and corporations abide by the free market. And in a true free market, the consumer is the king. What we have now is corporations teaming up with government to steal and make money off of the consumers. This isn't capitalism. It's not even close.\n\nCapitalism means nothing more than voluntary exchange between two or more parties. It is the purest of markets. How the government has brainwashed people into thinking capitalism is evil is just one more thing I'll never understand.\n\nThe absolute best part about capitalism is that the greediest of companies have to serve their consumers as best as they can if they want the most amount of money possible. So you can be greedy and selfless at the exact same time in a capitalistic society. You simultaneously are helping people and maximizing your profits.\n\nIn our markets now, if companies want the most amount of money possible, one option they have is to just bribe the government to pass a law saying only they can provide that product. Or the company can push for super expensive and stiff regulations so smaller businesses can't pay for them and therefore can't compete.\n\nBut these corrupt companies are just following their best incentive for money. Without government force, their incentives entirely shift back towards pleasing their consumers to the best of their abilities. Life is all about incentives.

But the science is obscured by big-industry smoke-and-mirrors, as it was with the now-acknowledged scientific truth about the harmfulness of cigarette smoking. In true capitalism, prices for things would represent their true cost. Gas would be $15 per gallon because the companies that supply it would pay for the bad repercussions (externalities) of their product. Then consumers could make a fair choice about whether they want it, or whether they'd prefer the development of something cleaner and less problematic to use as fuel. Government is only the problem if it is a puppet of industry, as it is today in the US. Demand better leaders. Industry exists to make money...period.

Think of how much 1,000 people consume a day. Now think of how much 8.43 Billion people consume a day... exactly. The problem is we're consuming more than the earth is producing. If you really think about it that's why we as human society need to limit the population, so we can balance with earth and how much it produces so next generations can survive.

Therefore we're not under the law of the old testament. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.\nAnd that takes us back to John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood). That's the gospel. Jesus said, Ye must be born again to enter into the kingdom.(accept Jesus as your SAVIOR)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Saved Sinner", "channel": "UCt5d791kM_Rs4ln-dSGcAIQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ERP19FL7ukscpZtOFG5J8FCCZfVVs5ZahfYvm6Qb8CBjQTmxJBkjDblOtIoCVgUxgPDz4feHnlI=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
