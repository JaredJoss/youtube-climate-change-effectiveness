(How does anyone but the insanely rich pull off building a permanent house on the river? And in the capital city???) Such as when I hear the word \"necessity\" been translated into \"has too\" (23:50 iirc), that just makes me suspicious as too what else gets lost in translation... But then I'm listening to wealthy people blaming \"society for the damage done to the environment\" almost makes me sick too my stomach at this point! \nPersonally, i blame the corrupt politicians and the giant monopolies they have enabled and/or enriched themselves from for decades. \nCorporations have shaped society with their filthy psychological manipulations, poisoning the masses with pharmaceuticals and our diets. They control all the economies, the mainstream media outlets, the laws and regulations. \nAnd even when we wise up to the facts and demand change, the people are still rarely acknowledged by those in power. \nI blame the 1% that have more accumulated wealth than the other 99% of the global population. \nBecause id gladly go without the materialistic crap and go back too a less intrusive life. If it meant change, like actual change, not some meaningless targets by some timeframe that most human beings can't properly appreciate, the people who can know they have no horse in the race because they already elderly... \nAnd then you say its only 2¬∞ knowing most people won't think of that 2¬∞ in the overall climatic sense and think its just added onto the highest temps they get daily during a year. \nIts such gross manipulation, just like the oil corporations have been doing for almost 5 decades!\nOh yeah, and if I didn't have too listen too another douchbag blaming \"ourselves\" for this climate mess. \nThere's only one genuinely wealthy man that doesn't piss in everyones pocket saying it \"costs too much to fix this\" and just gets on with it. And he runs one of the most successfull car companies at this time, and builds reusable rockets that land upright, among many other projects in the quest of advancing mankind in ways the world will appreciate for as long as it exists. \nReally, how much longer till the masses wake up to the barrage of BS and accept what most peoples commonsense and intelligence are telling them is anyones guess. But if a highschool dropout like myself can see through it, todays Kids will definitely if they don't already. Lets see if they're willing to join the masses in blissful ignorance in helping the wealthy get wealthier from their futures.... \nSorry for my rant you other 99%, but I was listening to the rest of this somewhat BS doco and it pee'd me right off!", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Jay Orzecki", "channel": "UC7ajjuAurit52DUYrnOcbVQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTYdH3n5_2rwCklewEVF6f_kCyIX2ekNDtAYritoQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgykV8SXdBKD7sJzjmZ4AaABAg", "text": "\"60 meter sea rise\" is a very tall lie. It is all Bull sh..t Everything is fine with Mother Earth and her seven seas because there is NO REAL CLIMATE EMERGENCY, only normal unpredictable weather despite what cruel \"child scaring hysterics\" say! They are wrong and you can relax about your precious children's future.\nAtmospheric CO2 is still too close to starvation-levels at current 400 ppm, so we could be living in a greener and lusher world if it could be boosted to 1,000 ppm again, as in past lush Interglacial periods. Humans are now recycling past plant-material transubstantiated into coal and oil which contribute very little to this huge global CO2 metabolism.\n\nGreen plant photosynthesis must be able to eat atmospheric CO2 to fabricate Carbohydrate sustenance and release O2 gas for us to breathe. Gaseous CO2 is for plants like life-giving breathable O2 gas is for us humans and animals. CO2 is NOT a poisonous weather pollutant and instead we depend on green plants and their productive use of CO2 for our survival!\n\nFACT IS that we live at the tail end of a 10,000-year INTERGLACIAL CYCLE and in just another one or two thousand years we are likely to slowly enter a statistically inevitable ~90,000 yearlong ICE-AGE. The seas in Northern Europe are draining due to the LAND-RISING because of the past pressure of a several kilometres thick ice-cap that  once weighted  the Northern land down. In other areas we see a relative SEA-RISING due to land dropping, especially at the edges of the grinding tectonic plates. Our planet is still ALIVE, and we can see this in beautiful geysers and destructive earthquakes and VOLCANIC eruptions. It is Earth as usual and perfectly normal!\n\nThat's right, our old Earth have had many such ICE & GREEN CYCLES with each averaging a total of about one hundred thousand years! So, we are extremely lucky to live at the optimum habitual time in current INTER-GLACIAL period, when obviously glaciers and polar caps melt and sea-level goes up. This climatic trend will reverse like a pendulum and the world will again grow massive icecaps that drains much of the seven seas all over again! Sadly, green plants and most living things will slowly perish over the next ice-age's many millenniums. Hopefully, the coming Ice-age will leave us a wide survival \"zero-season-zone\" around the equator for our future generations to escape to.\n\nEarth's complicated and varied climate reflects so many factors like humidity, reflective cloud cover, Earth rotational tilt angle, the shape of the annual elliptical orbit around the sun and of course interplanetary and interstellar radiation. And most of all, what \"mood\" our great all mighty shining SUN happens to be in!\n\nWe \"bipeds\" are not as important \"weather-masters\" as we like to think or fear, and I hope you understand that we definitely cannot \"operate\" and \"control\" Earth climate destiny by choosing a nuclear vs. wind electricity providers and driving to shops in a newly manufactured 1830 kg electrically charged (...from?) car instead of keeping the swift old VW or Fiat.  Lunching on vegan or eating genuine human food makes for no change, except for farting-frequency. Ignore slick advertising and enjoy your unique gift of life to the fullest and give the \"climate hysterics\" the \"finger\" because they are out to destroy your mental health for absolutely nothing in return. Trust me, we are so blessed to be alive in this time of geo-history!\n\nFinally, the real environmental problems are associated with foolish over-population, over-consumption, over-fishing, rapidly shrinking animal habitats and species eradication. Pollution of seas and air must stop, especially from China and all over Asia.

It's easy for people who design such things to say that they will survive and be optimistic, but climate change is no joke. Even if we as safe region residents in Asia or Europe are safe, the impacts of the water crisis will HUGELY bend our back bones. The economy will be hit, food will become scarce for poorer society members, and I could go on and on.

{"cid": "UgyE-fg8k3Z1u4wd44F4AaABAg", "text": "According to scientists and geologists there have been 5 MASS Extinctions in history. They speculate on why , the reasons they've come up with vary, asteroids, chemicals, carbon dioxide, global heating and cooling , changes in the Earth's movements in Space.\nAfter a mass extinction the time it takes for the world to reform, reforest , for animals to be 'created ' and evolve again can take hundreds of millions of years. \nWe know scientists generally speaking are concerned about global warming, climate change and the extinction once again of life on our planet - especially animal life and clean water problems. \nThe massive deforestation and  pollution problems especially affecting the oceans ARE a problem . Although the exact numbers it's estimated that 150 - 200 species of animal life, birds, insects, mammals, plants go extinct RIGHT NOW EVERY DAY ! Gone forever from our world.\nWhile we conspiracy theorists tend not to believe in Global Warming and this Carbon Dioxide hoax, the first signs of a mass extinction can sometimes been recognized by an increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . But either way, the problems of pollution are real. Scientists studying these problems believe we ALREADY INSIDE a state of mass extinction. In some cases in the past Mass Extinctions happened gradually over thousands of years .Now these pollution changes and the plant/animal die-offs  are happening rapidly.\nThe governments around the world are only playing lip-service to the pollution problems. Their pollution carbon taxes laws allow any other high polluting business company to buy 'carbon tax credits ' . These credits are issued to businesses which if they use less than the allotted amount allowed , can be sold to other higher polluting business companies for money. Thus, instead of lower pollution or carbon monoxide , these heavy polluting businesses can simply buy these credits from companies that don't pollute, and the amount of pollution in the air stays exactly the same. It's a farce.\nThe other thing, while they focus on carbon dioxide emissions they distract the public from the real problem - that of carbon monoxide.\nIn Agenda 21, 2030, they are going to relocate the world's population into cities . While they say it's to protect the countryside , small farmers do a great job of protecting wildlife usually and growing various different crops . While they are being quietly thrown off their land for a multiple of excuses, mostly engineered problems by governments for the specific purpose of getting them out of the countryside and relocated to cities, mono culture global businesses are doing the exact opposite of what nature needs to flourish - but these companies can obtain huge government grants, loans and bail-outs - again proving governments don't care less about the environment or nature. It's simply being used as ploy to get their whole populations into cities in order to track, trace, spy and control them. \nIf the scientists are right, that we ARE in the middle of a Mass Extinction including humans, then the Earth will continue it's species of life forms until it once again becomes completely barren. People are trying to make changes. Yesterday i put up a video about a man who is changing whole  deserts into green fertile land complete with streams and able to grow crops. \nIf / when the Singularity comes - please look it up if you aren't familiar with this advanced technology - - the powers at the top have the idea that the whole world's population will be connected to computers straight through the brain, into ONE singularity - ONE computer - ONE brain - ONE force - One mind - \nWhile their bodies will have been re-engineered with metal implants for strength - in a science film i saw they were advertising this idea trying to convince people it would be cool, for example you could three metal arms not two - knit 2 jumpers at the same time ? \nIf that time comes and i'm sure it will, the dopey public will accept anything that's sold to them with a free dohnut - or if they are told that to refuse these technologies would lead to their deaths from a virus will eat their skin if they don't - or whatever dumbass reason they construe, the brainwashed, TV addicted, too lazy to think or question obedient conditioned  snowballs of the future will agree to.....\nWhen the world has first become extinct of Real souls , real human spirit , natural extincts and emotions , people who think critically and relate to a past of freedom, have any real honest sense of spirituality , or bravery - when the world's population has become an alien species of computerized brains incapable of independent thought - and unable to remember what a natural human body without mechanized implants looks like ...maybe the natural world, itself destroyed also by pollution, chemical over-load, barren of vegetation , animal life limited, will go into a MASS EXTINCTION. And once again as in the cycles of the past, the Earth in ruins, will rest once again for a hundred thousand years .......the human life extinct .....only to start over once more from the beginning ......and that maybe how the Earth rids itself from this ugly cancer of mechanized human robots - the rising phoenix of the  rebirth  of the Earth and nature.\nMaybe all this has already happened before ......scientists talk of past mass extinctions caused by acid rains, mass die-offs in the oceans and massive amounts of carbon in the skies...maybe that is how the Earth rids itself of predators such as what the human race is becoming. Maybe it has rid itself of us before , just as it did the predatory dinosaurs .......maybe this global warming, climate change is all part of Earth's strategy .......it's  forward -looking plan......", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Athens R", "channel": "UCzSbu6jn9rXaOcVFj4vzDiA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLREEFScxWyJ0EbOvSTnFkBKYPx_oyDRI0jYzg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It states in the bible that Jehovah God will destroy those destroying the earth. Well when do  you think that will happen and  guess who are the ones destroying the earth? Think and look in the bible for answers for a change. This 'adapting' to it is a bunch of nonsense from one end to the other. What about the global trash problem in the oceans?

And that won't happen because of \"developed\" countries. Your luxury is someone else's hell. Don't worry you will also feel the heat of the hell when it comes to your shore. Tell your developed countries to stop going to wars and produce more huge amount of carbon emission and chaos everywhere. Instead they can use that money and energy to build more sustainable lifestyle. \n\nThe rich people emit carbon for fun. I see people chatting s**t in their cars for hours and the keep the engine running. Don't they have brain that it's polluting the air, and the same air they going to breath few moments letter? And governments are greedy scumbags, they put carbon tax and do nothing afterwards. Most probably they just share the money between themselves by the name of increasing their wages. \n\nI've got many ideas from devices that can break the big waves (so that it can't break the shoreline easily) to exatracting silt from murky water.

The term was coined by American engineer Eric Drexler in his book Engines of Creation (1986). Molecular electronics‚Äîa subfield of nanotechnology where individual molecules can become circuit elements‚Äîwould make it possible to manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic level, and this, combined with advances in the physical sciences and gene technology, would make it possible for enormous transformative power to be unleashed.\r\n\r\nOptimists have hailed the positive possibilities of such self-replicating machines. Molecular-level ‚Äúassemblers‚Äù could solve the world‚Äôs energy crisis through low-cost solar power, cure terrible diseases like cancer by boosting the human immune system, completely clean up the environment, and even enable the restoration of extinct species. The cheapness and abundance of materials, since the basic building blocks of the technology are at the molecular level, would make it easy and cheap to create any product, including incredibly inexpensive pocket supercomputers.\r\n\r\nHowever, pessimists have warned against the possibility of such molecular-level assemblers wreaking havoc because they could spin out of control, could be deliberately diverted to destructive applications, or become so incredibly efficient and intelligent that human oversight or control would become superfluous. Central to this argument is that nanotechnology crucially gives nanoassemblers the ability to reproduce, meaning that it would be a small step from an intelligent robot to a robot species. Moreover, historical examples of unforeseen consequences of technological innovation, such as the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or DDT-resistant malarial mosquitoes, have been used to underline the dangers of creating robots, engineered organisms, and nanobots that self-replicate, manifestly multiplying their capacity for destruction of the physical world.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Li Joso", "channel": "UC4-Yy-sWql-wrI8bn7GOwyw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR1r_Yn8HHxVxIP-xRtuDM7PhSYQRgPp5jpiw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

With that kind of sea level rise do not be surprised to see super tsunami's. In the last 20 years over 200 super waves have been recorded reaching between 50 and 200 feet high and these are just babies compared to the giants our future generations will have to endure. There is 5,280 feet in a mile, let's do the math. 72.1785 yards X 200 feet = 14 435.7 feet SO THE COASTS ARE LOOKING AT FUTURE WAVES OF OVER TWO AND A HALF MILES HIGH, HERE IS THE FUTURE; I PROMISE HUMANITY THIS. I can damn well guarantee boating, fishing, surfing, diving, oil tankers and container ships will come to a dead stop because it will be two seriously dangerous to take any chances and lose everything in the ocean. What happens when you take a small fish limited in growth by it's bowl and place it in a pond? It grows bigger so we can definitely see the possibility of megalodon returning.

Top ecologists like Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, have stated that warmer temperatures and higher CO2 levels are conducive to the further greening of the earth. Plants would thrive and the deserts would recede. Plants thrive at 1100 to 2000 ppm Co2 in the atmosphere. The current average is 400 ppm. A tree consumes 2000 gallons on average per year.\n You also would gain agricultural land were there is now tundra and permafrost if the earth warms. So, you can't predict that there would be a net loss of habitat. You would also increase the evaporation cycle so there would be more water vapor  held in the atmosphere at any given time and in places that currently get very little rainfall.\n\nAll these things aside, if you're reading this, let's conduct a basic science experiment.

{"cid": "UgzqM_gt-gPKrvQns8l4AaABAg", "text": "It would be interesting to know what happened in the Arctic during the 10,800 BCE abrupt climate change. We know there were two ice sheets - smaller Cordilleran and bigger Laurentide on North America. The Laurentide perhaps 3 - 4 km thick at some places. \r\n\r\nThere was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.\r\n\r\nAdjusted quote: \"Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ‚àº9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ‚àº10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.\"\r\n\r\nIf interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ‚àº9% of world terrestrial biomass on ‚àº10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km¬≤ in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps CO2 released by burning of ‚àº9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ‚àº10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. \r\n\r\nThere is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?\r\n\r\nOne simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. \r\n\r\nRecent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. \r\n\r\nThe paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w\r\n\r\nImpact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. \r\n\r\nThere are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // \r\n\r\nIt is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible \"string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000‚Äâm‚Äâin diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. An encounter with such a million-km-wide debris cluster would be thousands of times more probable than a collision with a 100-km-wide comet or a 10-km asteroid.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "George Davidson", "channel": "UCtyV7Beit_SWdT2KNr1vfyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx4xXk1jpkfSZ8o717Z5OWTte0w6J1Mh0riw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Their myopic vision of global warming is infantile .... really !\nLet's get is straight, global warming is a very real and very dangerous issue. But will not cause rising sea levels. Even when it gets warm enough for the poles to melt. However, and this is a huge however, what will come will be worse.\nYou see, when the average temperature rises it is true that ice melts. That is kindergarten science. But something else happens simultaneously. A massive increase in evaporation. And it turns out that the effect caused by melting, is more or less equalised by the loss of ocean water by evaporation for every degree rise in temperature. So everything is OK, the ocean levels do not rise significantly. Well, not exactly.\nOcean evaporation happens naturally all the time, even today. We call the phenomenon clouds. And when the clouds get heavy enough another phenomenon happens. We call it rain, or precipitation. It also has the effect of destabilising the equilibrium of the atmosphere, which causes yet another phenomenon, we call that wind.\nToday, when the oceans warm up significantly during the summer, all of these phenomenon combine, and are regularly observed. This causes a tropical storm, or in extremis hurricanes. A hurricane is determined by extremely high winds, atmospheric distortion, and massive amounts of rain.\nHence, rising temperatures will not cause the oceans to rise, but a massive increase in rainfall globally, causing flooding in inland as well as coastal areas. And if you happen to live in an inland city that lies in a terrestrial depression, it will be worse of all, as the rainfall will be significantly higher than the lands ability to disperse it. You certainly will not want to be living anywhere near a river or lake, or a delta.

The total mass of Greenland's ice sheet is a stunning 2.85 million cubic kilometers. The melting is between 195 and 239 cubic kilometers per year (referring to two different studies). This means that to melt it all will take (2850000/200) 14250 years -- using 200 km3/year. Also according to Wikipedia, this will cause the sea level to rise with 7.2 meters. This will equal to (720 cm/14250) 0,5 mm per year, or 5 cm in 100 years (2120 AD).\r\nThis should hardly be a cause for alarmism, and it leaves us with plenty of time, a century, to adjust to the 5 cm rise in sea level, which involves taking a tiny step back.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "daNorse", "channel": "UCZKcYAeBExRPEaBzkOXnwnw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRAQGH6jlVURkfOSUK-ZRlhb0MaPU4yz_2MAURN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The term was coined by American engineer Eric Drexler in his book Engines of Creation (1986). Molecular electronics‚Äîa subfield of nanotechnology where individual molecules can become circuit elements‚Äîwould make it possible to manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic level, and this, combined with advances in the physical sciences and gene technology, would make it possible for enormous transformative power to be unleashed.\r\n\r\nOptimists have hailed the positive possibilities of such self-replicating machines. Molecular-level ‚Äúassemblers‚Äù could solve the world‚Äôs energy crisis through low-cost solar power, cure terrible diseases like cancer by boosting the human immune system, completely clean up the environment, and even enable the restoration of extinct species. The cheapness and abundance of materials, since the basic building blocks of the technology are at the molecular level, would make it easy and cheap to create any product, including incredibly inexpensive pocket supercomputers.\r\n\r\nHowever, pessimists have warned against the possibility of such molecular-level assemblers wreaking havoc because they could spin out of control, could be deliberately diverted to destructive applications, or become so incredibly efficient and intelligent that human oversight or control would become superfluous. Central to this argument is that nanotechnology crucially gives nanoassemblers the ability to reproduce, meaning that it would be a small step from an intelligent robot to a robot species. Moreover, historical examples of unforeseen consequences of technological innovation, such as the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or DDT-resistant malarial mosquitoes, have been used to underline the dangers of creating robots, engineered organisms, and nanobots that self-replicate, manifestly multiplying their capacity for destruction of the physical world.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Li Joso", "channel": "UC4-Yy-sWql-wrI8bn7GOwyw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR1r_Yn8HHxVxIP-xRtuDM7PhSYQRgPp5jpiw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I remember in the 90s when Canada started the moritorium on Cod and found the Spaniard and others and fished illegally with little consequences.   Despite the moritorium and restrictions occurring in the 90s, the cod fisheries have still not rebounded and it's 30 years later.   And this is just one example.   We are killing the world and no one seems to care.   For myself, in my entire life I've had one forkful of fish in 1968 and never have eaten seafood or fish product since.

Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nFrom global warming or climate change there is going to be mass extinctions of humans and wildlife, we do not know when, but from pollution also we are going to face mass extinction.\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. \nCold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things which are not required as a necessity for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.\nWhat about the companies that are going to be shut down. They would have debts to pay, just excuse them.\nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \n\n2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, noodles, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. Humans have to do this before it is too late.\n\nIf this is done, then many jobs would be lost. For that many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. Please don't think farming as a low work. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming.\nIs their any another solution, that humans won't lose jobs and also planet earth will be saved.\nIndustrial jobs or planet earth, which should we save, planet earth is more important. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans after 100 or 200 years. Humans should not want this to happen.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Land based houses on high land do not have this problem. Like apartments the owners of floating homes will have high maintenance fees which will need to be paid throughout all their lives, for many people adequate pension provision or lifelong working into old age will become essential, not possible for many present day people unless the government moves to protect job security and ensure pension income for all.

Greenhouse growers boost plant growth by releasing CO2 into the greenhouse to about 1200 parts per million!

Ice on land that is not displacing the water (most of greenland and antarctica) are not floating in water and so are not displacing the water level. When they melt they will then add fheir water to the ocean. At the end of the last glacial period, sea levels rose 400ft when the laurentide, cordilleran, scandinavian, patagonian, etc ice sheets collapsed and melted. Put some pieces of ice in a seperate cup, alongside the cup of water, wait for the ice to melt then pour it in the glass of water.

Galvanic corrosion is a big deal in the ocean and anything with aluminum in it is very susceptible to galvanic corrosion since it is so high up on the periodic table. Titanium is almost inert in seawater but it's not only very expensive but really hard to work with (watch a video on building the SR71).  Don't even think about Monel or Hastelroy unless you have a defense department budget. Schedule 316 Stainless is fairly cheap and quiet good in marine environments but as soon as you get it underwater in a low 02 condition it will corrode just the same as regular steel. Concretes are great in compression but are useless in tension so you have to reinforce them with something. I remember the ferrocrete craze in the 80's and that was a clusterfuck of epic proportions. There could be a case made for 3d printing waste plastics and forming habitats with that. Then actually encouraging organic encroachment and turning your home into a reef. Then below water windows could have robotic wipers that clean off critters that want to attach to the glass. Oddly enough marine life loves attaching to glass what with it being all smooth and hard. You are not going to build those gleaming white pleasure domes in an oceanic environment without a lot of expensive maintenance. Take it from a long time sailboat owner who loves the ocean.

But the others looked pretty \"meh\" in terms of storm(surge) contingency strategies. And the higher a house(boat), the broader and deeper it needs to have a \"rooting\" in the water to not be able to be \"toppled over\" or even to the side.\n\nAnd there were a lot of constructions shown, that didn't look very \"aerodynamic\", so force of air moving (wind) against their flat surfaces would meet maximum resistance - which translates into kinetic energy, that could move the construction one way or another, depending on the rest of its design.\n\nBut the overall \"security concepts for floating Housing\" was missing entirely in the Documentary. A few minutes before the end, when floods and catastrophes were mentioned, I was thinking \"Oh, now they finally get to it.\", but: they didn't. So, without very realistic concepts implemented into these ideas, I will just \"smile and wave (goodbye)\" at them. Utopian Designs can be inspiring, but they need to be tested and refined with REALISTIC conditions, challenges and threats and then be adapted accordingly - which is why I favor the French Architect most, too, since he kinda mentions, that he also is aware of pragmatic steps of adapting his aesthetic ideas to pragmatic circumstances/conditions.\n\nSo, I wonder, if there is an extra documentary about safety of these floating constructions?", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "BulukEtznab", "channel": "UCK0rcKruUjXV4upDA0dnTxQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSlWhHGY_g19i_8fDd7KaZ4iZ9X_Xn2VPFthGvD=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

While a relatively moderate appartment costs about ‚Ç¨200,000 (and up) in Rotterdam. Note: Upperclass housing in Rotterdam is far more expensive. ‚Ç¨600,000 and up for an upperclass house is not uncommon in Rotterdam (or Amsterdam).\nNote: You can find cheaper housing in Rotterdam. But a) not by much and b) either very small or of low living quality.\n\nTo my knowledge, no taxpayer money is invested in building these houses. I do not exclude that some taxpayer money is invested in innovative solutions of which the design of waterbased housing is one of them. This money usually goes to universities or other nonprofit organisations.\n\nConcluding (with respect to The Netherlands): \nYes. It is currently more expensive. But the expenses are going down each year. It is not that much more expensive (or even cheaper) when compared to the upperclass housing in (for instance) Rotterdam or Amsterdam.
