{"cid": "Ugz7xj_GqWyYgEnoYWJ4AaABAg", "text": "It would be interesting to know what happened in the Arctic during the 10,800 BCE abrupt climate change. We know there were two ice sheets - smaller Cordilleran and bigger Laurentide on North America. The Laurentide perhaps 3 - 4 km thick at some places. \r\n\r\nThere was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.\r\n\r\nAdjusted quote: \"Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.\"\r\n\r\nIf interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ∼9% of world terrestrial biomass on ∼10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km² in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps CO2 released by burning of ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. \r\n\r\nThere is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?\r\n\r\nOne simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. \r\n\r\nRecent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. \r\n\r\nThe paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w\r\n\r\nImpact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. \r\n\r\nThere are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // \r\n\r\nIt is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible \"string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker–Levy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000 m in diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. An encounter with such a million-km-wide debris cluster would be thousands of times more probable than a collision with a 100-km-wide comet or a 10-km asteroid.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "George Davidson", "channel": "UCtyV7Beit_SWdT2KNr1vfyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx4xXk1jpkfSZ8o717Z5OWTte0w6J1Mh0riw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is due to many local and state governments being influenced over the last 3 decades by policies of The Greens, which is to prevent fuel reduction burns. Historically these have been carried out for thousands of years in winter, to prevent the vast conflagrations we are seeing now.\nBush-fire Scientist David Packham predicted massive out-of-control fires will happen if Loony \"Green ideology is not stopped\".\nHe said forest fuel levels had climbed to their most dangerous level in thousands of years because of \"misguided green ideology\".\n\nWild Fires are inevitable in Australia. Uncontrollable conflagrations near residential areas are not.\nGreen activists who actively prevented the usual fuel reduction burns and sabotaged fire-fighting equipment must accept the responsibility for the extent of this summer's fires, along with the many arsonists. Most fires this season were started by humans.\nThe real question is; which US billionaire is paying these climate activists to sabotage fire-fighting equipment, and to start fires?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "1000frolly PhD", "channel": "UCAR0Oi4L0Om4F26uwpANgCg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS9Ee_42WCD5gmEqpIuRejEbGtOetI20pMu5PHr0A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There's only 1 natural predator to the 3 largest species of kangaroos, has been that way for 30,000 years & everything worked just fine until these grass eating hippies started saying \"oh the poor kangaroos, they look cute, you can't eat them\" & so the homosapians were lost as natural predator & kangaroos have been experiencing \"boom & bust\" periods with constant population bottlenecks ever since & these idiot vegans still refuse to just shoot & eat the excess to keep the population in check & instead insist on catching each of the 50 million roos to implant them with contraceptives, at a cost of over $1000 per roo - and HUGE trauma for it!

Durting the middle ages they had the same warm weather that we are facing today. Yes that is documented. Its getting warmer now for about 300-400 years to come, its the suns cycle and not global warming, thats why it gets warmer and warmer each year. Poor humanity if they are being brainwashed for 300 years to come that global warming is the reason for the warm weather, keeping the humanity in fear. But wonder what they will say when its getting colder again, that the sun is dying due to other climate changes?

They used advanced mathematical analysis techniques to study the climates of rocky surfaced planets and moons in our solar system.  They found they could accurately predict their long term average surface temperatures by knowing just two strategic facts: their distance from the Sun and their atmospheric pressure.  This formula has worked correctly for Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Pluto, and for Earth’s moon, Europa, Callisto, Titan, and Triton.  Their predictions have been proven accurate to within one degree Celsius.  Like the value of Pi, this mathematical relationship will never go away because it was created by Nature, not by man.\r\n\r\n     Nikolov and Zeller found that the specific gaseous composition of the atmospheres of planets and moons are irrelevant to determining their long-term average surface temperatures.  For example, the atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, while Earth’s atmosphere contains only .04% carbon dioxide, yet that information was not even needed to predict temperature.  The logical conclusion is that atmospheric gases only contribute to warming by their physical mass, which increases atmospheric pressure.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Christopher Calder", "channel": "UCvSKssyAcpW72YG-0bXTcEQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRQJSEALvByp3i1iJLqW6sUr_tYpFnItD0S4CZu=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwADXjLsA0ojSlo-XZ4AaABAg", "text": "Climate change is only small not as they are putting it all over the media. The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly  up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

Don't take my word for it, I challenge you to get you a King James Bible and read for yourself. Before someone goes bashing against something, don't you think they should know what they are bashing?? Our Heavenly Father wishes for none to perish but for all to come to repentance and call on Him. He does not desire sacrifices, for Christ was the sacrifice for all:\n\n*For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.*\n*For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved.*\n           *John 3:16-17*\nYou see the Bible is not a book of hate and condemnation, but of hope and of love.

CO2 emissions 60% are from electricity production and heating systems during winter and 25% is cars. We can solve those 60% with measure that will collect CO2 on source where is produced. Collecting 10% CO2 mixture of gases that comes from every chimney of some electricity production power plant is much easier and more efficient that collecting from air (do not trash garbage on the street).\nRest 25% emissions from cars should be moved to electric cars .\nI'm too for capture from air but first things first. Please distinguish these two things capture on source and capture from air. \n\nThanks!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Kloko Loko", "channel": "UCTjA6jHHcAVRQY2dJSHscaQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRMtnoxfu_eKMhZE6R3QUbeZRFtVfY4ImiLqe3M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's about the effects on the agricultural and forestry sectors, which had hundreds of thousands of hectares of produce and timber plantations destroyed.

But that data point needs to be qualified with the fact that the last two years have seen death valley break the global record for hottest average monthly temperature twice in a row, far surpassing the 1913 situation. Climate change is about how much heat is in the atmosphere: average temperatures over a period of time are a far better indicator of that than individual maximums.\n\nAustralia may not be hot along the coasts, but climate change has certainly made it drier along those coasts, to the point that the bushfires burned right up to the water this year, for the first time I'm aware of.\n\nYou call climate science a religion, implying it has some kind of dogma involved.

My point was more about media trust in the face of conflicts of interest. Given that I don't get my information about climate or environment from The Guardian or SMH or whatever, but from primary sources and independent news outlets, I think it's a valid point to make. Maybe I should've made that clearer.\n\nRe. subsidies, in 2017, fossil fuel subsidies in Australia were $29 billion. [1] In 2013-14, fuel excises brought the government a revenue of $10.8 billion [2] (and falling by the year due to increases in vehicle efficiency). So those numbers don’t quite stack up. And even if it were true that petroleum wasn’t net subsidised, it still most certainly wouldn’t be true for coal, which is a more pressing issue, and really deserves the focus at this point.\n\nHere’s a quote along the same lines from source [1].\n\n“The under-pricing of fossil fuels, particularly coal, was found to be the largest source of effective subsidy. When the wider social and environmental costs of fossil fuels were taken into account, the IMF found that price paid for coal was typically less than half of its true cost.\n\nThe report found that if fossil fuels had been priced appropriately, global carbon emissions would be reduced by 28 per cent. Significantly, effective fossil pricing would also lead to a decrease in air pollution deaths by up to 46 per cent. The elimination of fossil fuel subsidies would also increase global government revenues by 3.8 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe upward trend in global fossil fuel subsidies echoes similar analysis by the International Energy Agency that came to the same conclusion, particularly in relation to direct government support for fossil fuels.”\n\n[1] https://reneweconomy.com.au/global-fossil-fuel-subsidies-reach-5-2-trillion-and-29-billion-in-australia-91592/ \n[2] https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BriefingBook45p/FundingRoads", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ted Hennicke", "channel": "UCAxoCEyOjFuSpuVj-dUSYmQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLThdPGVpakpOZ_v9i2UJGYufMU0rcntraU3P09f8Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(They want to tax you more, but environment won't be better I can assure you that, don't know that? See this comment after 2022).\n\n3. Don't plant trees if you don't have plan and don't understand food-chain. You can't have tree near by trees, one lights on, everything burns. (Better don't plant especially if it's NOT planted properly).\n4. Climate change is sponsored by Soros and other elites. Greta is his puppet.\n5. Big companies are responsible for war in Iran. That fuel that they want it will be used to improve AI (which works worse than human, for now).\n\n\nBurning trees in Australia is the same reason as burning Amazons.

Do you think for yourself, or just rephrase verbatim from news propaganda about how we’re all doomed unless we change yesterday? \n\nDespair is a useless emotion, better to turn it around into something practical, like I’ve done. I do not accept that we’ve sealed our fate, because the Earth is over 4.5 billion years old, and never before have species been aware of gas levels in the atmosphere and tracked the data - that in itself is a massive advantage. The Earth has it’s own ways of balancing out impacts, for example where Bushfires burn and heat the upper atmospheres, very quickly this turns around to rain events. Where the Oceans absorb heat, the icecaps melt (even if just for a season). When the Earth’s orbit distances itself from the Sun (solar minimum) we see hemispheric cooling, contrary to the popular belief of “Global Warming” because it doesn’t actually warm the world over, there are inconsistencies which is why “climate change” was adopted. Scientists are desperate to remain relevant in the modern age of technology and global information available in seconds from a device in the palm of our hands, which is why they have to come up with terminology and ideas that we’re approaching a doomsday in order for them to secure funding that keeps them employed and food on the table for their families.\n\nWater Vapour is the most prevalent Greenhouse Gas, yet we hear nothing of it, because it doesn’t sell and doesn’t sound as bad as Carbon Monoxide or Methane or Carbon Dioxide. \n\nChildren do not owe their parents anything, because they were not cognisant of the decision to be bought into this world, it is the realm of the parent to plan the life for the child, and not bring them into disadvantage caused by short sightedness. Like you, I also fear for food availability in the future and have chosen not to bring extra people into this world. I’m okay with that because I feel that is responsible. I do not buy meat, partly out of principle and partly out of price, there is still plenty of dietary protein available from plant based food. Our ancestors also ate a majority plant-based diet, it’s only that excavations have located animal bones in close proximity to human remains that they’ve deduced that they ate animals - but the associated plant matter that was once there has decayed a long long time ago, having left little to no trace people believed that meat protein was a staple, which it wasn’t.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Joe Bloggs", "channel": "UC4tCfjRJhdes9LqDgmZNRUg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEF8WfWL77KsiQFdxV3YFfLB3MGbHKI-n6Hg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Not rocket science!

To try to claim they couldn't measure is just another cop out! You know full well this year's fires are much bigger! Additionally we know that the 1939 fires were put out after just over a month of burning for the longest burners, with a day of RAIN! We have had a week or torrential rain & flooding in the bushfire areas this year but the fires have persisted despite that, which makes it abundantly clear that these fires are far more intense doesn't i! We also know that the majority of the 1939 fires were started deliberately by people thinking they could protect their properties & selves by backburning. How many amateur people today look at the fires they are seeing & think \"oh I think I can start a fire & maintain full control over it & it will be a good idea\"? The fact that people aren't dreaming of doing that tells you that they know the fires today are far worse than the 1939 ones!\n\n\nHow much evidence do you want that this year's fires are worse?

Note also that on two of the four measures that I used, the current fires are the worst. \n\nIn comparison to previous years, this is less intense than either Ash Wednesday (1983) and Black Saturday (2007) which left a (far larger) toll in human lives and homes (nearly as great as the current fires), in a much shorter time period. I believe that this is due to better management of the fires (especially prioritizing people over property, as well as better resources to draw from,  as you pointed out), better education and communication of the affected communities, and a more fortunate location of the fires. But the very length of the fire season is very draining. \n\nOn your point about the ability to back measure where forests have burned, I stand corrected if I left the impression that attempts to compare hadn't been done. Although my point about it being difficult to measure and to make accurate comparisons with today's fires still stands. As an example, one scientific paper (MacFarlane, Australian Forestry, 1988) estimated that 79% of Victoria's mountain ash forests burned during the 1939 fires. (For comparison, Victoria contains about half as much forest as NSW, where the bulk of this current fires have been, and most of it is in the central highlands Northeast of Melbourne). If this is true, the current fires may well have some way to go to catch up, in terms of area burned. My point isn't to say that this publication is the truth, but to show that making seemingly simple comparisons is fraught with uncertainty. So the scientifically judicious viewpoint is \"we don't really know\", which is what I stated. With the rise of aerial photography and satellite imaging, it is much easier to make such measurements today, and errors are much tighter. But this wasn't the case in 1939.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Brendan H", "channel": "UCGdtcKxBLXIHh9h8T8jpalw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQVUS8t3yRGMiE8H9ZGRxb5XFMyFd1G7BxmPQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This season I watched the Turramurra blaze (an arson one) from my home, I'm too far away to have seen the actual flames & I didn't even see the 737 fly over & drop it's fire extinguishing load, probably due to the smoke, watching that smoke was scary! The speed the sky went from nothing to orange to black was freaky! Nothing like those in Victoria are describing, but watching it over a half hour period, after having been in the ones in the nearby suburb years earlier, it is obvious the difference between now & then!\n\n\nIn terms of arson, there is less arson in NSW this year than most! People are too scared to be lighting fires. Just because the coal industry supporters are promoting stories about 200 people who don't speak English & don't live anywhere near any bush lighting BBQ's on their inner city apartment balconies & their neighbours are calling the police to report them & the police are attending & giving them official cautions for lighting fires, doesn't mean there's suddenly an influx of arson! Traditionally most bushfires in Australia have been the result of arson, now it's mostly lightning, especially for the large ones. Here's a full story on the largest Australian bushfire ever & how lightning started it https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html & here's the weather systems being caused by these mega-fires & how they light more fires https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-01/why-bushfires-that-spin-are-incredibly-dangerous/11834006\nApparently though, you're not interested in any of that, because I'm just an Australian, not an Australian business person & you're only interested in businesspeople's views for some reason, maybe because they tend to lean right & think global warming is a hoax? (at least they say that, they all know it's not, they just say the political lines of their party). Fyi, there are MUCH easier ways to identify Aussies talking about the fires, simple terminology & spelling will give away who's Aussie & who's not with ease, but I really don't think you want to hear from Aussies, only a very select sub-group of Aussies that you have found to be spouting your pre-decided views. If you listen to general Aussies, you will find your claims are NOT supported at all!\n& starting a gofundme page for ONE person right now just shows how out of touch & disconnected from what's going on these people you are associating with are! It's not like there's 1 single mother out there that's lost everything you know! Centrelink are on the ground, with their mobile services & online support to assist those sorts of people & the red cross is there too, linking them to the various services & people donating clothing & other needs & those professional services are also providing physiological support & long term support for rebuilding, to try to separate individuals from proper long term support instead of just donating to established services imo just shows those people to be selfish & wanting to make it about them, instead of about the people they're claiming they want to help. I'd put it to you that it is even possible that those people who are talking about Aussies being scum (lighting fires) may themselves be the scum of the earth & may not even be passing those donations on, but rather pocketing the money. Like it or not, there are bad eggs out there & you certainly sound like you have found some!\n\n\nIn Sydney at least, you cannot have a conversation with anyone without the topic turning to how bad the fires are this year & how we've never seen anything like it before (mostly referring to the air quality, which is an inescapable reality of daily life right now! Better since the recent rain, but even tonight, when I went outside after dark to water my garden, at first I thought it was raining, but the ground was dry, I then realised what I was watching in the torchlight raining down on me was ash! That's even when the air doesn't smell of smoke & when there's no obvious reduced visibility! And that's from LIGHTING fires NOT arson ones!)\n\n\nhttps://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me If it's in a metropolitan area, it's arson (or idiot), if it's in a non-metro area, it's lightning, if it's near another fire it's ember or firestorm lit.

I think we both agree on that?\n\n\n\"So the scientifically judicious viewpoint is \"we don't really know\"\" rubbish! The numbers for this fire season are 10 times more bush burnt than in 1939, we know for a fact the numbers from 1939 were NOT recorded as over 10 times less area burnt than was in fact burnt!\n\n\n\" 79% of Victoria's mountain ash forests burned during the 1939 fires. (For comparison, Victoria contains about half as much forest as NSW\" That's just straight out deception on your part isn't it! You're comparing 1 mountain tree species with entire forests of another state! So I googled mountain ash trees to see how common they are & found, surprise surprise, they are limited to mountain areas - which is not a lot of Victoria is it! They are also a rainforest tree & only grow in areas with seriously high rainfall, which again tells you they are not found in much of Victoria! Additionally, wiki says \"Most of the E. regnans forest across Gippsland was cleared for farmland between 1860 and 1880, and in the Otway Ranges between 1880 and 1900\" so yeh, you've provided absolutely nothing to indicate in any way that the stats from each even, this one showing 10 times the area of 1939 being burnt were off at all, let alone off tenfold! In fact, when we look at other stats from the past, we see that there is usually an over estimation not an under estimation, so if the 1939 numbers are off, it is far more likely to be similar to temperature reading of the past & that in the future it is found that they were seriously exaggerated NOT downplayed! There is no question these fires have burnt FAR more area than the 1939 ones - unless the flat earth someone changes amounts burnt over time, that's the only way I can see the numbers could be as far off as you are claiming", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Why are humans supposedly so important?\nDo you know that the entire population of 8billion puny humans could be sardined into a 3KM square cage? \nLastly, surely you know that Earth revolves @ 1000MPH and hurtles thru space @ 70,000MPH on an elliptical orbit with the sun and other planets that takes 26,000years. During that time...changes on Earth take place...research that please?\nThe energy required to propel Earth and the Sun and planets on that orbit is far beyond any human comprehension....\nThanks for your reply also.......Keep studying!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "BANG HEAD", "channel": "UC4XXgcIwLwXCvYDWpPks-OQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8l-DlLq_M6RG7XoSXo2XCEyCGfe5kwP9c2Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Matt 4:17 For God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son that whomsoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. John 3:17 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 4:10 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 Jesus Christ came to save His people from their sins. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. Heb 9:22  Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us. Eph 5:2 Christ died for the ungodly. Rom 5:6 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace. Eph 1:7 Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah, the Son of God, who fulfilled over 300 prophecies, who came to save His people from their sins and from the wrath of God to come. Jesus was born to a virgin, lived a sinless life, willingly went to the cross to die in our place, was buried in a tomb, rose from the dead on the third day, and was seen by many over the next 40 days. He ascended back to heaven in the presence of many witnesses and is at the right hand of God the Father interceding for the saints. Jesus will return soon to judge the living and the dead. \n\nThe times of ignorance God overlooked, but now He commands all people everywhere to repent, because He has fixed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed; and of this He has given assurance to all by raising Him from the dead. Acts 17:30-31 We implore you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God. For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.2 Cor 5:20-21 And there is Salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12 Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ; but you must repent and obey Him. Believe, repent, endure. Now is the day of Salvation. 2Cor 6:2 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

{"cid": "Ugw1r1U8ZZPBJWBnpj54AaABAg.93oMQdgAHDZ93xRamjJCXI", "text": " @Nick002  We wrecked stuff because of our sin. I totally agree. But I assure you that God is the answer to everything. He can and will do what is necessary to fix all things even if it means growing the landmasses or the size of the planet. God is all powerful and can be relied on regardless of human understanding; we must humble ourselves and ask and He is gracious to give.\nThere are videos out on YT now that claim the exact opposite about population control. Now the supposed experts claim that population control measures have backfired and as a result the coming lack of people will cause great harm. I've seen the vids and actually watched one of them.\nJesus is your Salvation; you need to come to Him. He died to pay for the sins of all who trust in Him and repent of their sins and endure to the end. You need Jesus because every one of your sins will be judged and punished by God either paid for by Jesus on the cross, or by you forever in hell. You need Jesus. And trust me; one who fled from God for many, many years, you want God. \n\nRepent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand. Matt 4:17 For God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son that whomsoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. John 3:17 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 4:10 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23 Jesus Christ came to save His people from their sins. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. Heb 9:22  Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us. Eph 5:2 Christ died for the ungodly. Rom 5:6 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace. Eph 1:7 Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah, the Son of God, who fulfilled over 300 prophecies, who came to save His people from their sins and from the wrath of God to come. Jesus was born to a virgin, lived a sinless life, willingly went to the cross to die in our place, was buried in a tomb, rose from the dead on the third day, and was seen by many over the next 40 days. He ascended back to heaven in the presence of many witnesses and is at the right hand of God the Father interceding for the saints. Jesus will return soon to judge the living and the dead. \n\nThe times of ignorance God overlooked, but now He commands all people everywhere to repent, because He has fixed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by a Man whom He has appointed; and of this He has given assurance to all by raising Him from the dead. Acts 17:30-31 We implore you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God. For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.2 Cor 5:20-21 And there is Salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12 Salvation is by grace through faith in Christ; but you must repent and obey Him. Believe, repent, endure. Now is the day of Salvation. 2Cor 6:2 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Heb 10:31 Follow Jesus ONLY; HOLY BIBLE ONLY. peacewithGod . net // esv . org (I am not affiliated with these sites.)  \n\n“I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” Jesus Christ Luke 5:32 \n\nTo God alone be glory.

It feels comfortable, not too hot, not too cold. \n\nNow you start to chill with ice. \nIt gets colder and colder as the minutes tick by, eventually it is just  a few degrees above freezing but it really feels fine! \n\nNow, you take that hand and plunge it into the other pan, the one that still contains lukewarm water. \n\nOUCH! It BURNS!\n\nWhat happened? The temp in the first pan changed so slowly that your mind and body barely perceived the shift. Eventually you experience it to be the new normal. By comparison, lukewarm (the center) now feels VERY HOT. \nIf cold is left and hot is right, far-left is now the new center. You can even put your hand in FREEZING water below zero celsius (salt added) and it feels quite tolerable... you could even get used to it as frostbite starts to kill your fingers. \n\nOn the other side, if you now try to put your hand into HOT water, which previously would have felt like a nice comfy, freshly poured bath, it hurts, you feel a BURNING PAIN and instinctively flinch, jerking your hand out of the water which, despite being only bath temp, now feels BOILING. \n\n\"I definitely don't want to touch that you think to yourself. \" \n\nThis is what has happened in politics and society due to a constant flow of increasingly far-left propaganda, television series, movies, magazines, school and university curricula, laws and govt policies. \n\nAll parties are \"progressive.\" \nAll media is \"progressive.\" \nAll curricula are \"progressive.\"\n\nThe presence of \"right wing\" or \"fascist\" media and politicians are merely a distortion of your perception of \"center.\" \n\nThis incremental shifting to create a new \"normal\" is sometimes called Hegelian Dialectic.\n\nDid you ever ask yourself what is the destination of all this \"progress\"? \n\nHere is a clue, Read Orwell \"1984\" and Huxley \"Brave New World.\"\n\nHuxley was an insider, his brother was directly involved in the long term plans we are now seeing come to fruition.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Forest Denizen", "channel": "UC0tJpbqZeOC5R6K_i42mgzg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS8Y4QAHCviTROp3YId6OkOYnlf_QKAf9CShw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
