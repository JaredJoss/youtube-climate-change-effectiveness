{"cid": "Ugw-p_aVHKyD9HcHw5N4AaABAg", "text": "Ok climate change is a real thing that the democrats did not just make up but this is time time I think its taking it too far. Trump can speak for himself he's a complete idiot. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's approach is horrible. Im not trying to sound like a radical republican I'm saying the point of view of a non socialistic democrat. While the Green New Deal doesn't eliminate planes and cars and cows, it is a horrendous proposal for 3 main reasons. 1. It costs $93 trillion. Our GDP is $44 trillion. We couldn't sell all of our countries assets and pay for this thing. No country would be willing to give us a loan of that amount and no other country even has that much money. Its just unreasonable. 2. It crazily decreases the freedom of people and increases dependency on the government. Im not saying that declaring climate change as an emergency is socialism, im saying the Green New Deal is socialism. This is the Old Red Deal again. The Green New Deal is basically Marxism disguised in a modern form. I know government spending increases are bad and thats why spending on a wall doesn't make sense either. But this Green New Deal will drive taxes up crazy. We know from 1920's and 30's that lower taxes even for the wealthy are beneficial to the economy and that raises in taxes can turn a recession into a depression. Government spending is not good. These high taxes demotivate people to work because most of their money is taken by the government and it gives the government so much money that they use to redistribute to everyone. This dangerous cycle caused by extremely high taxes continues as the government tries to make everyone the same. But the truth in humanity is not everyone can be the same in opportunity and ability and eventually the government is going to run out of using other peoples money. This socialism turns into communism eventually. We've seen what this system does before in Russia and Cuba and Venezuela. The Green New Deal will trigger this cycle. Its the simple truth of communism that the system doesn't work and its an unrealistic utopia. It makes a bad problem worse. Again im not saying Trumps actions are proper either and I agree that climate change is important, but the Green New Deal a. k. a. Marxism is not the way to solve it.\nEdit: Also climate change is a natural thing. Its been happening forever since the beginning of time. 15 years ago Al Gore said we would all be underwater in 12 years if nothing was done.

It draws thousands of school kids in the streets every week, some accompanied by their teachers ( yesterday’s march drew over 10.000 people, I think, with the presence of the young Swedish girl who had been demonstrating alone in front of the Swedish parliament since August). All of a sudden, our political class woke up, and with election coming in 4 months, every party claims to be greener than the others. France is starting to do it too. This has so far ,to my knowledge, not been relayed in international news, but I think it should. Not only is the citizen taking over from our failing politicians, but teenagers, saying: ‘we don’t want to be left with the crappy planet you are making, now it’s your responsibility to act, it’s our future you’re playing with.’ Why don’t you do something similar in the US big cities?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Myriam Ickx", "channel": "UCK7hmGi5rdYhIWhj1PCpxYw", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQviPdV3NuP_oLDw7AbxIRNjLeV0X4Un8WItZ497w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The bigger problem, IMHO, is if a foreign power comes up with an alternative fuel tank or plane first, taking out our fuel supply would turn an entire battle group into immovable chunks of easily targeted metal.  They lighter alternative energy tanks would be free to pick off the $6.2M M1A1, or simply avoid them, to be further able to cut off food and fuel.  Use your imagination.  \"Tesla Tanks\" if you will.  Hydrogen cells could be refilled at lakes and rivers.  Small nuclear technology could be developed. Mobile command centers could use solar and wind.  Also, looking at Puerto Rico, we could save billions or have more people \"Up\" buy using some of the technology used by sail boots and yachts.  Solar panels and 2' windmills are common.  Switching to low power accessories will allow each off the grid house to run off batteries.  Certainly cheaper than the unreliable wires we run house to house now.  One woman in Florida had built a house with power, plumbing, and sewage.  This house WOULD be up and running in a near miss hurricane. The problem was that Orlando would not be able to bill, (for sewage, I think). so they made her reconnect.

You see when I was a sophomore in HS I had a since teacher that told our whole class that by the year 2000, and due to the \"New Ice Age\" everyone living north of Kentucky would be living in and igloo. When I told her I did not believe her she said the science was real and could not be refuted. She also disliked me for questioning her. LMAO!\n   In 1993 Al Gore wrote in his manifesto on global warming that by the year 2008 all of the cities along the coasts would be partially under water due to polar ice melt. Unfortunately for all the AL and his band of chicken little types this did not happen. When asked by a reporter in 2018 (10 years later) why this has not happened yet, he replied, \"Well......, It just hasn't happened yet.\"\n   A few years ago and before the words \"climate change\" was the new buzzword for these scares that have not happened, they all used the words \"global warming.\" It was good old Julian Assange and his merry band at Wikileaks who hacked into the emails of the International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC and broadcasted them to the world. Oh My! What a revelation they were!! These pseudo scientists had bragged to one another in their emails about \"fudging the numbers\" so that their scary \"global warming\" plan would work and they could get people to go along with it.\n\nLadies and Gentleman...NEEVR EVER let someone from any form of government use the Hegelian Principle on you. Hegel said that governments will:\n1. The Tale,\nStir up the populace with a FEAR (Future Events Appearing Real) problem,\nThe Hook\n2. Wait for the reaction, and when the populace was frightened enough, which is,\nThe Sting\n3. Come up with the solution, which this time is to get you to pay a \"carbon tax\" that will be used to offset your \"carbon footprint.\" Which actually means you will hand the international bankers (their handlers) your wallet to pay for a non-existent problem, which is \"Climate Change.\"\n It's kinda like watching the movie \"The Sting\" isn't it?

Go check the NOAA and NASA websites.\n\nThe 6% shift in agricultural production from food over to fuel production had nothing to do with reaction to climate change, but rather a move to alternative fuels in response to the middle east quagmire that President W dropped us into.\n\nAnd you make a strawman argument with your third post, as I never said anything about the industrial revolution or how fossil fuels built our prior technological base.

You see a scientific consensuses allows for people to disagree, but the overall community of scientists reviewing the same data come to the same conclusion.

Global warming is not specifically related to the problems with fires in California.  The problem with California is that it's the desert and now 40 Million people live there.  I lived there for 4 years and it's a tinder box.  We drain the water off it even further for our houses and farms and this is what happens.  We build houses near/in the woods and act surprised when they get burned down.  The cycle near San Diego is predictable... The fires come and burn off the dry kindling on the sides of the hills and mountains.  Then the rains come and cause mudslides because there's no kindling left to hold the dirt in place.

There wasn't exactly a worldwide community of humans back then throwing up CO2 into the air, so why'd it change then?\" Even doing that gets you labeled as a climate denier. \n\nMaking someone contemplate that the earth is a rock flying through infinity, and that it is barley allowing life to live on it due to some lucky chemistry and physics (keep in mind there's a reason we have trouble finding other life in the universe), well that turns out to be too complicated. It's much easier to just say someone is a climate denier. They're either paid off or too dumb to understand. \n\nOh the irony of that type of thinking as Al Gore and Solyndra runs off with money for doing nothing....   \n\nIt's almost the same as religion back when they thought the earth was the center of the galaxy. People who pushed against that thought were labeled as heretics. Socrates was killed for just introducing new ideas into his society. \n\nThe far left tries to push that it is the party of science while it mocks the history of science. Science does not exist in safe spaces. You need to have constant questioning and you need to assume you are wrong in the world of science. The far left that Seth Meyers pushes is the opposite of that. They always assume they're undoubtedly correct and that others are morally (not just factually) wrong. \n\nBTW\n\nIf you're afraid of climate change then you're kind of missing the big picture. Eventually the Earth is going to be swallowed up by the sun (ignore the fact that life will burn up far before that though). No amount of clean emissions is going to save you from that one. \n\nIf you think the earth is going to became like Venus, then how about you pool together a large sum of cash (Bernie can get millions overnight apparently) and then gather the A Team of global scientists, engineers, chemists, physicists, blah blah instead of forcing the false idea that the government is going to fix things?

Social ownership can be public, collective or cooperative ownership, or citizen ownership of equity.\"   @Brain Slugs ", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "MoodyMoose", "channel": "UCrZZNw2IzuDutvTG1tMSJ9g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSG7cJkTHQ3gqMhfkFpPCSbSpmGqPIAs4TryA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I agree with you that we must defend our freedom.  On the other hand, from the moment we accept that an economic regime governs our moral values.  Is not our freedom of action also limited?  If we close our eyes every time our system is uneven, we never fix the shot.  We must adapt our system to the reality of today, not the one of 1776.  The wealth of the Nations of Adam Smith is good, but we must not forget that at the time there was a triangular market.  England, Africa, Antilles, goods were routed from England to Africa.  In Exchange we bought raw materials and slaves.  These slaves were sold in the West Indies for raw materials, the invisible hand which had to breathe in sound management, never manifested itself.  It is not for nothing that there have been people like Karl Marx.  Karl Marx reacted in the face of the social life of his time.  Children who worked in the mines, or elsewhere.  That being said, I don't think his vision was perfect either.  But there is probably something in the middle that could better adapt to mankind.  We must apply the same logic that Jesus told the men of his time.  God did not make man for the Sabbath but the Sabbath for man.  Our system must be done according to humanity and not humanity according to the system.\n  Certainly we will not find a perfect solution, but at least we must try.  We can try and deceive ourselves as a society, but what does not seem logical to me is to accept the flaws without attempting to correct them.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Tec no", "channel": "UCoTQOiQeyXB_9K52qATSquA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgwtwq_1JitBCBfEV2_o1uRu6VPUh72gv_qg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It can be turned into grasslands if you want to & that's a rather smart thing to do to fight climate change, given that grasses in those regions are generally C4 plants & c4 plants make up just 5% of terrestrial bio-mass but account for 23% of terrestrial carbon sequestration. All trees are C3, none are C4 & with C4 species evolving last time the planet warmed in direct response to that as trees died, the logical thing to focus on is the restoration of grasslands not forests anyway. In the US, grasslands are the most endangered eco-system, with less than 0.5% of the original grasslands surviving today! They are the original \"Buffalo planes\" & support diverse wildlife & plant species, many of which are now endangered due to habitat loss.\n\nThe main reason for grasslands destruction is disruptions of natural cycles, with grasses not being allowed to reach maturity & then have their keystone species fertilise, prune & spread their seeds. On grasslands, the keystone species is large grazers, they do the job bacteria do in wet forests, breaking down decaying matter. Without them, the land desertifies. Since the advent of effective guns, we have removed the vast majority of the large grazers from the planet! Total ruminant numbers, including all domestic cows, sheep, goats etc alongside the bison, wildebeest, deer, moose, antelope etc are now at record lows! We have never had so few large grazers on the planet in human history! If we want to save the planet, we need to start with the world's 5 billion hectares of grasslands & get them functioning again, either with wild grazers or livestock managed to behave like wild grazers, moving daily & letting natural grasses reach maturity & seed before allowing them to graze again. \n\nSaving the forests is great, but climate change is going to kill them anyway! If we want to save the world, we need to focus on the C4 plants & getting carbon back into the soil where it belongs! Half the world's grasslands functioning properly again (only large area currently doing so is the Serengeti) for 10 years would see atmospheric CO2 back to pre-industrial levels! This is cheap & doable now, we all should be pushing for it! Close down ALL feedlots & put all available cows back on grasslands under proper, regenerative agriculture, holistic grazing management!

But that doesn't make arguments in favour of cutting down on meat consumption any less valid. Meat is consumed too much in the West, and becoming more popular to the East. It is a health concern for many, and an environmental concern everywhere. Fish is less of a health concern, but as much of an ecological one. If we can survive, without killing off our population or forcing population control measures, by being smarter, why wouldn't we? Growth should be focused on cities ('economy of scale' means that the bigger a city/town, the more efficient per capita for everything from water use to land use) and effort should be made to coax people into more plant-based lifestyles. Among other things.\n\nHumans have always attacked our environment, primarily for food, even before agriculture. We can trace the arrival of the first humans into the Americas by the wake of extinct megafauna they left. Since agriculture, it's only become worse. Estimates of original post-glacial forest cover in the UK, for example, exceed 50%, where now forest cover is around 13%. Most of the land in the UK is covered by pasture (29%), then cropland (27%); and much of the crop is used for fodder.

However, due to the ... activity of RuBisCo, some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated, resulting in loss ... and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration.\nIn order to bypass the photorespiration pathway, C4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO2 to the RuBisCO enzyme. ...Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO ... CO2 is incorporated into a four-carbon organic acid, which has the ability to ..(extra processes here).. use this CO2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C3 pathway...\nThe primary function of kranz anatomy is to provide a site in which CO2 can be concentrated around RuBisCO, thereby avoiding photorespiration. In order to maintain a significantly higher CO2 concentration....\n\nC4 plants have a competitive advantage over plants possessing the more common C3 carbon fixation pathway under conditions of drought, high temperatures, and nitrogen or CO2 limitation. When grown in the same environment, at 30 °C, C3 grasses lose approximately 833 molecules of water per CO2 molecule that is fixed, whereas C4 grasses lose only 277. This increased water use efficiency of C4 grasses means that soil moisture is conserved, allowing them to grow for longer in arid environments.\n\nToday, C4 plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant biomass and 3% of its known plant species.[10][16] Despite this scarcity, they account for about 23% of terrestrial carbon fixation.[13][17] Increasing the proportion of C4 plants on earth could assist biosequestration of CO2 and represent an important climate change avoidance strategy. Present-day C4 plants are concentrated in the tropics and subtropics (below latitudes of 45 degrees) where the high air temperature contributes to higher possible levels of oxygenase activity by RuBisCO, which increases rates of photorespiration in C3 plants", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It also has an additional half a million other animals like zebra, lions etc\nThere are 5 billion hectares of seasonal grasslands like the Serengeti in the world (the pink on that map I linked to), for all to be fully funcitonal would therefore require 10 billion large (cow sized) grazers or 5 billion bison sized grazers (they're double the size of cows) or 8 times the number for sheep sized grazers like antelope & deer (80 billion animals total).

That is the numbers that were present before humans started shooting them!\nCurrently there are 1.5 billion cows on the planet & around 1.1 billion sheep & goats. Pigs & chickens aren't ruminants or large grazers, so we'll exclude them, so if 96% of the world's ruminants are only those 2.6 billion cows, sheep & goats & the sheep & goats are only a 1 to 8 ratio on size, that means we have less than 1.8 billion cow sized ruminants total on the planet instead of the previous 10 billion, even including the 4% of wild animals remaining. Rounding up to 2 billion, that means that methane emissions from ruminants like cows, wilderbeest, bison etc are now 1/5th the emissions from pre-industrial revolution, so I'm assuming you have graphs showing methane emissions have decreased to only 1/5th of their former levels in the last 200 years right? If not, then clearly ruminants aren't impacting methane levels are they - or actually they are, the shortage of ruminants means burning is needed to replace them & the latest NASA study actually shows that burning grasslands is the missing link to explain methane levels.

And?\" therefore, as that is the weather we are increasingly dealing with, they are therefore the plants we need to be focusing on growing. We can also use them to produce food & therefore leave forests alone to save species there.

Koppen climate classification semi-arid cannot grow forests! It's that simple! & most of that land has been grassland for 300 million years.

Layer chickens require 45kgs of maggots per year (1/4 pound per day) & in return produce 25,000 calories worth of eggs per year per chicken, so there's about another 15 million calories being produced from that too, which even without the cows outperforms most crops vegans eat, but the cows are producing over 30 million calories per hectare you will see if you do the calculations based on crop yield next to food needs & growth time\n\n\"and, because it's a neighbour, NZ:\" Antarctica's closer, why didn't you use that as the comparison?

My first comment was primarily a call for the regeneration of forests worldwide, and certainly not a call to ignore grassland.\n\nYour first response linked to a page which you claimed showed desert etc in white.\nGreen has the ability to grow forests or crops, pink is semi-arid & only has the ability to grow grass or livestock, white is desert, tundra or mountains with minimal agricultural potential\n\nTo be clear, this is false. Look again. Green, orange, and white are 'humid', 'arid', and 'outside extent of agriculture' respectively. For example, the South American rainforests are in white. Not desert, just not currently 'within' the extent of agriculture. But this is clearly false, as areas we know to be agricultural in Australia, Scandinavia, the USA, Canada, etc are marked in white. So I don't know what to do with the map.\n\nAnyway, after that, much of your first response does make sense. I do not agree with any of your solutions, but we do agree on a few key points.\n\nIn the US, grasslands are the most endangered eco-system, with less than 0.5% of the original grasslands surviving today! They are the original \"Buffalo planes\" & support diverse wildlife & plant species, many of which are now endangered due to habitat loss.\n\nSure. Don't forget about original forests there either, though.\nhttps://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/brochures/docs/2012/ForestFacts_1952-2012_English.pdf\n\"Since 1630, about 256 million acres of forest land have been converted to other uses—mainly agricultural.\"\n818 million acres of the 2.3 billion acres of land area in the U.S. is forest and woodland today as compared to around 1 billion in 1630.\n\nBut even ignoring forest... why is the answer for grassland to promote domesticated herds? Why not wild?\n\n\nwe need to start with the world's 5 billion hectares of grasslands & get them functioning again, either with wild grazers or livestock managed to behave like wild grazers, moving daily & letting natural grasses reach maturity & seed before allowing them to graze again.\n\n23% of sequestration is done by C4 plants. OK. In hot climates suitable for C4 plants, I agree that where land offers potential for them, let 'em rip.\n\nYes, we agree. But again what reason to choose livestock over wild grazers? As long as humanity is addicted to animal food, there will be little responsible management of such herds. There is little now, as you yourself are pointing out. The issue of biodiversity is also important. The long list of ruminants you posted is great. Would it be better to continue raising cows in their place?\n\nhttps://www.iucn.org/commissions/world-commission-protected-areas/our-work/grasslands\n\nGrasslands are, like forests, an important ecological feature, and we agree that they should be protected. Protecting them surely does not involve amassing herds of domestic cattle in them...?\n\nHalf the world's grasslands functioning properly again (only large area currently doing so is the Serengeti) for 10 years would see atmospheric CO2 back to pre-industrial levels! This is cheap & doable now, we all should be pushing for it! Close down ALL feedlots & put all available cows back on grasslands under proper, regenerative agriculture, holistic grazing management!\n\nWe can agree on closing down feedlots, and surely agree that the further destruction of any forest or grassland for agriculture is something we want to avoid. Why not just stop promoting livestock agriculture altogether? There's a definite feeling I get from arguments like yours: \"I believe the climate is changing, I want it to stop, but I want to do it by promoting human management of ecosystems in order to raise meat, rather than looking at what the land used to look like worldwide and promoting a return to it through the retreat of humankind and replenishment of prior ecosystems.\"\n\n\nForest, grassland... the destruction is continuing. Why rave about the wonderful benefits of flooding grassland with cattle while never once appearing to consider, and certainly never admitting, that a reduction in meat consumption even in just the world's wealthier nations would contribute tremendously to slowing climate change?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "A Man, Alive", "channel": "UCV9UAd5TW6usutQLoR_3RIQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQgtkyyhB8n9QjW4vc9P0_ry_HZiNCE20FYHSizyw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That's my whole point. Crops can only grow in \"humid\" areas, if you want to use land beyond \"humid\" for agriculture, then the only option is livestock agriculture for that land, since crops are incapable of growing anywhere outside the green zones. The pink areas marked on that map are in fact \"semi-arid\" not \"arid\" & as such are highly suitable for animal agriculture, as they are the planet's traditional grazing lands, the lands where large grazers are the keystone species.\n\n\"areas we know to be agricultural in Australia, Scandinavia, the USA, Canada, etc are marked in white.\" yes they are. Those lands are far lower in productivity than the green & pink areas, but yes, people will push the boundaries & try to farm beyond the zones considered as usable. The areas beyond that zone in Australia for example are grazing at a rate of 1 cow per 10 hectares instead of the regular 10 cows per 1 hectare used within the pink area. They also require installation of watering points for the cattle at regular intervals as there are no rivers or other natural drinking water sources in that area, no doubt the reason kangaroos evolved the abilty to hop in order to travel over 100kms per day, along with the ability to drink water only once every 3 days, so that they could graze those lands that are up to 300kms from the nearest water source, with each grass plant spread a few metres apart. Because humans have found a way to use that land agriculturally, doesn't mean it's actually within the accepted range of agricultural land. Same with the cold & altitude in the other areas you mention there .\n\n& btw I said & you quoted \"with minimal agricultural potential\" I never said it can't be used at all, because I'm quite aware that some of that land is in low level agricultural use\n\n\"So I don't know what to do with the map.\" A map like that I've found very hard to find, I wish there was a clearer one, but that's the best I've found, but it is a very good general base. I mostly actually just wish there was a larger version of it. Anyway, if you want to see the base, but more complex data used to create that map, try here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification That is what that map is based on, Koppen climate classifications as to what grows in what climates \n\"For example, the South American rainforests are in white. Not desert\" because again that map I linked to is just showing 3 categories, arable, livestock & unsuitable. It doesn't separate out dry desert, tundra or excessive rain or altitude, it just puts them all into the white category. Crops cannot be grown in areas getting over 60mms of rain every month in the form of daily heavy storms, it simply washes away the seed & also all nutrients as well as failing to provide the required drying off period for crops to store, likewise cattle cannot handle that level of soggyness under their feet to eat perennial grasses planted in those areas, as they suffer fungus, having evolved to live on dry grasslands, therefore, those areas are outside the range of agriculture for all commercial crops & livestock we currently grow in the world. If you look in detail at the koppen classification map you'll be able to see what the problem is with each area you think doesn't belong in the white category, I was just simplifying it with the 3 colour map.\n\nI'm going to separate my responses for easier reading :) next to come soon", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Don't forget about original forests there either, though.... 818 million acres ... is forest and woodland today as compared to around 1 billion in 1630.\" Just editing what you wrote a little further with ... where removed to make the numbers there clearer. 46% was forest when whites arrived, now 34% is forest. I dont' have the numbers on grasslands, but I think we both know that they were substantial, given that they supported 30 million bison (who are double the size of today's large bulls), so when there are now only 0.5% of those grasslands remaining, I'd say that is a MUCH more serious problem than forests that have only seen a 10% reduction don't you? 99.5% reduction & extinction v 10% reduction & extinction, pretty clear cut to me!\n\n\"mainly agricultural.\" yes & lets be very very clear here, the bison planes were already the perfect environment for cattle, there was no cutting down of ANY forests in America for livestock! That entire 10% forest clearing was for crops! If you want that 10% back, which seems to be really important to you, then the ONLY way you can acheive that is via the reduction of CROPS! You cannot achieve that via the reduction of grazing land, as it is different koppen climate classifications & forests simply do not grow on semi-aird lands, likewise, if you try to grow crops on them, the result is a dustbowl, because they are simply not suited to the constant planting & harvesting of pioneer species, short growing, short rooted crops. I mean tbh no land on the planet is suited to that! Anytime anyone plants crops anywhere, it will always cause serious land damage because nature designed pioneer species to act as short term erosion stoppers ONLY, they were never meant to be harvested & replanted repeatedly! There is simply no ecologically friendly way to plant a field of pioneer species on their own & then remove them a few months later leaving the ground bare. Never has been & never will be! This is why we are losing 75 BILLION TONNES of carbon rich top soil through crop production every year! (and that is a hell of a lot of carbon going into the air!)\n\n\" why is the answer for grassland to promote domesticated herds? Why not wild?\" \n1. We know full well that if the grazers don't keep moving & allowing the grasses to fully regrow between grazings, that we will damage the ground probably just as much as not having them there & we will certainly still cause the plant species extinctions if the plants can't reach maturity & produce seed, therefore whatever animals are used MUST move regularly.\n\n2. cost. Who's going to pay to constantly move wild animals? & are they really wild with that happening anyway? Wild animals will spread out & remain in a small area & act exactly the same way as cows do if there is no threat to them & therefore cause exactly the same damage as badly managed cows. Just look at zoos around the world to see this. \n\n3. the alternative to human herders or fences for wild animals is predators that keep eating their weak & babies if on their own. For that to work, very large areas of space are needed so that animals can form very large herds to feel safe from predators. After a fortune is spent on securing corridors or huge continuous chunks of land for this, predators now find they cannot easily target young or weak animals in the large herd & so they turn their attentions to easier prey, such as lone human children & most people have an objection to living near this, therefore removing the available land for this system, resulting in a situation such as only 0.5% of a country being set aside for natural use & any animals that venture beyond it's boundaries being shot. \n\nNot very effective for large scale genuine conservation is it! Compare that to Alan Savory's property in Zimbabwe, where he uses a domestic herd to tend & repair damaged land in a controlled way, while also letting wild animals live side by side with them. Because the domestic herd is doing the main seed spreading & fertilising work, it doesn't matter that the elephants & zebra are wandering around on their own or in small groups & in fact, he uses them to his advantage, by creating as I said above, with a large protected herd, therefore causing the lions that are sharing the land with the goats & cows to not even bother trying to kill the domestic animals, but rather to go for the easier solo wild animals. I don't see a situation like this https://youtu.be/q7pI7IYaJLI?list=PL1mdVN1WPaRkJ7K-1vi2VTLfyL2Z9W7zF&t=652 as negative for the land, when considering that it is funding the presence of all the wild animals now found there.

{"cid": "UgwzYwlW8d5S-D6TTKh4AaABAg.8rbFiFyOOAZ8sB1jAd9oq8", "text": " @A Man, Alive  \" In hot climates suitable for C4 plants\" yes they are only suited to hot climates & hot wet climates we will want for our crops (the c4 rice conversion project is an interesting one for that for the future though) , so yes, they will be limited to that area in genuine usefulness. C4's cannot be used in cooler climates efficiently (although \"painted mountain corn\" is an interesting little project that really should be getting way more attention from people with a genuine interest in feeding the world, since it's a c4 growing over 5000ft altitude in areas with only 2-3 months frost free!) so overall I'm not suggesting c4's be planted outside their native range in cold areas (unless climate change changes their native range, then we should extend them to the new hot dry areas). Cooler areas c3 plants are better & cool wet areas, trees or permanent plants are better for the environment than pioneer species repeatedly removed & replanted.\n\n\"I agree that where land offers potential for them, let 'em rip.\" remember though that because of that extra step in their photosynthesis, they require extra energy to fuel it, so they are very heavy feeders, evolving alongside large herds of grazers that were smothering them with manure each time they were pruned. They are used to a situation where almost all their growth is recycled into fresh fertiliser for regrowth via grazers eating them, pooping it out & dung beetles burying that seed filled dung under the surface where erosion & sunlight don't wash away or deactivate the nutrients. For c4's to grow well they need extensive quantities of fertiliser, needs to be a whole herd of animals not just one of two (if not using chemicals, corn uses MASSIVE amounts of chemical fertiliser to grow it for humans to eat!)\n\n\"But again what reason to choose livestock over wild grazers?\" because I'm paying to fund this (as are 95% of the population) & you're not. Again, if you want to fund it, go ahead, but otherwise, you need to accept where the funding for this is coming from & it's coming from meat eating & also from trophy hunters! The left side of politics is contributing next to no funding for any of this & unless you do, it will remain a pipe dream & never eventuate! Look at even basic proposals like the \"buffalo commons\" & the trouble funding that! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Commons\n\n\"As long as humanity is addicted to animal food, there will be little responsible management of such herds.\" on the contrary, feedlots are a problem, but if consumers demand grass fed, then economics actually causes responsible management, since the moving daily results in 4 times as many animals being fed on the same space, so farmers have financial intensives to manage well. \n\nLets put this a different way, The Great Barrier Reef is in trouble! Climate change is hitting it hard, but so is nutrient runoff, feeding crown of thorns starfish that then eat it to death. The Australian government has trialled a number of different strategies in the agricultural runoff area, all voluntary. It funded the conversion of over 1 million hectares of cattle farms to holistic grazing, paying for water points in each paddock & extra fences, but no ongoing funding, that was it! Farmers get that if they agree to train in the system & follow it, but there is no enforcement, they can convert back to regular if they choose to. Not a single cattle farmer has converted back! Not only that, many of those farmers have now used the profits they have made from their quadrupling of meat production to buy additional farms in new areas & self-fund the infrastructure for holistic grazing on those as well. In most cases, they have bought dilapidated land with serious damage to it for super cheap prices, since it can't grow anything & they are restoring that land back to prime quality land, many becoming entrepreneurs, buying poor, selling after repair, buying new & repeating. Each time they do that, they not only improve that land for themselves & their cattle, but also for native animals & plants, all while making lots & lots of money. Nothing wrong with getting money for repairing the planet.\n\nNow right alongside & mixed into these cattle farms is the sugarcane industry, also with huge runoff issues & also put under voluntary programs to reduce fertiliser run off & use it more efficiently. Now again this is more profitable to the farmers right? Less fertiliser costs means more profits? (and the Australian government removed all fertiliser subsidies decades ago in an attempt to reduce use & encourage better land management practices, so fertiliser costs are high) So here's how that one's going http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-11/laws-not-stopping-fertilser-runoff-to-reef/10348718 complete fail. Even tightening & still a complete fail! 100% compliance with run off rules from grazers, very low compliance from crop farmers because there's just not the financial intensives with the crops as there is with the cattle management \n\nAnd additional to all of that, there are some extreme tactics needed at times with very poor quality land, tactics that can only be achieved with domestic animals, such as the overnighting pens seen in that Savory video above, not to mention issues like a lack of available large herding animals for use in many countries such as Australia. It's easier to herd cats than kangaroos. Bison could certainly be used though if people preferred them in America, but right now, they will need to be eaten to fund the operation - unless you are offering alternative funding options", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Would it be better to continue raising cows in their place? \" \nlook there are many areas of the world where what I would like to see is the creation of new Serengeti style areas. Map out an area for a new wildlife refuge, with millions of hectares of land involved. Map out an annual migration route for a large herd & then begin doing like Savory is doing on his property, but mega, mega scale!  Bring it up to 50,000 cows & goats instead of just the 500 he has! Pay 100 or so herders to manage that herd & run them through the migration route & in the process improve the land, bring them full circle & continue them into round 2 of the migration route, siphoning off some of the livestock to continue paying the wages of the herders. When local wildlife rescue groups find wild babies that have been orphaned or otherwise need care, give them the basics & then release them into the domestic herd. Grab some from the Serengeti as well & breeding programs in zoos & add them into the herd. by having a herd that large, they will barely have any contact with the humans anyway, will just be in the middle of a moving mass of animals. Year after year repeat the migration route, collecting more & more stray wild animals as they realise that this mega herd is the safest place to be because we now start releasing some predators into the area to reduce the need for the human herders & restore instinct. As the wild animal percentage in the herd increases, gradually reduce the number & level of herding, just some gentle nudging & monitoring to ensure they are learning the migration route & passing it down to their babies. Eventually the last of the domestic get pulled out & the herd allowed to continue doing it's own thing, just with radio trackers on some of them & some basic supervision, which potentially doubles as tourism dollars, or carbon credit dollars.\n\nThat would be great to see imo, but you know what, right now there's no funding for land for that. If it happened, the land would improve & then become the target for acquisition for corrupt politicians & it would crash & burn, not to mention we still can't even stop poaching! So yes, I'd like to see wild animals used BUT we have 12 years to reverse climate change! That is not going to happen in 12 years! Livestock CAN & that is why that must be the first avenue we go down imo. There is nothing wrong with using livestock anyway on land currently devoid of wild animals. It's a much more environmentally friendly way of producing food than these repeated pioneer species crops are, especially when combined with the massive numbers of animals we are dehoming & poisoning to protect those crops! Livestock on grasslands has FAR less carnage all round than that has!\n\n\"Protecting them surely does not involve amassing herds of domestic cattle in them...?\" well right now the only people offering to fund what's needed are meat eaters & hunters! So do you want trophy hunting or herds of cows? & if neither, then unless you have an alternative funding proposal, you are actually condemning the grasslands to their death. Think of it like child labour, you might not like it, but when the choice is that the child works or starves to death because they couldn't afford to buy food, then my vote is to let them work short term while addressing the main problem & also improving their working conditions until that's done. Child labour I would want almost completely ended long term (paper run etc is fine with me), cattle farming I have no problem with as long as it's managed properly, so no doubt we have different views on the long term on that, but isn't the short term goal the same? To fix climate change & to improve the lives of cows etc while figuring out what the next step is?\n\nOne more point on that too, which you're not going to like, but it is reality. Your link is for temperate grasslands & they are hugely important, but so are the seasonal grasslands found in warmer climates, they are probably even more important than the temperate ones for climate change reversal, since they're the c4's, while the temperate ones will be a mix of c3 & c4, likely tending towards mostly c3's (long term c3's will potentially need more protection as they will lose their current areas to more tropical species, but they may pick up new tundra land too, time will tell) anyway, back to the bit you won't like, using that Barrier Reef run off zone as the sample area. That region has seen HUGE increases in species diversity https://youtu.be/oPLXsqS9SSc?list=PL1mdVN1WPaRkJ7K-1vi2VTLfyL2Z9W7zF&t=105 but how that is done & particularly how the natives are brought back from apparent oblivion is with the use of cows as tools to repair the ground. In areas that have had years of chemical fertilisers used, soil is dead! There are insufficient microbes in the soil to allow the growth of the native grassland species (1/3rd of all the world's arable lands are damaged to the point that they can barely produce crops anymore due to overuse of chemical fertilisers causing serious damage to soil microbes & without the microbes, the plants can't turn chunks of iron into absorbable iron, can't turn shells & dead animal hoofs into usable calcium & magnesium etc etc) These lands take decades to restore with regular grazing, never restore without grazing, or alternatively, they can be restored in only a matter of months with strategicly used cows as tools. This is what mine restoration does to turn rocks from the middle of the earth into soil & this is what these Barrier Reef farmers have also been doing to access native plant seeds that were dormant for decades due to a loss of microbes. it looks horrible, but remember it's only being used at night here (mines do it day & night) but 2 weeks of this can return most, if not all native plant species to an area https://youtu.be/fnv1tDuzjiM?list=PL1mdVN1WPaRkJ7K-1vi2VTLfyL2Z9W7zF&t=158 Farming has damaged the planet & so now properly managed farming has become the best way to fix it.

It would obviously be good to get free birth control out there for any woman in the world that wants it in order to stabilise global populations, but that will take time, so in the meantime we need more food (or less waste) to feed a growing population. I know my food space requirements because I grow 100% of my plant based foods myself, but I don't think you realise the space needs of your foods. \n\nVegans like to talk about how they've heard that their food CAN use less land than meat eaters & yes, grown in the most efficient way possible, 1 hectare of rice paddies can feed up to 500 people on starvation level rations, especially when vegan is thrown out the window & fish & ducks are added into the paddy for malaria & pest control & fertilisation, but the reality is that a typical western vegan diet is incredibly demanding on land requirements & more than that, it demands not only the precious arable land, but the best of the arable land! \n\nThe vast majority of the bulk of your food is likely grown on land with enough water to grow rice, but is likely producing enough food to feed maybe 1 person per hectare not 500 due to your choices in low efficiency foods. If you want to stop rainforests from being cut down, you need to think about the space needs of the plants you eat & then add into those considerations how much fertiliser they need as well & how much damage that does to the land long term https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/arable-land-soil-food-security-shortage\n\nWhat's your food growing space profile? What's your chemical fertiliser use profile? (and remember that if you don't have livestock sharing the land your crops grow on, you will need chemical fertiliser) & what's your food waste profile? http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/infographics/fruit/en/ I'm guessing the bulk of your food is probably in the 45% waste categories, would I be right? Additionally, what's your crop waste profile? What percentage of the plant grown for you & fertilised for you do you actually consume? & what happens to the rest of that crop that you don't eat? How much land to you make look like this https://grist.org/industrial-agriculture/2011-04-13-big-ag-washing-away-midwest-topsoil/\n\n\"Why not just stop promoting livestock agriculture altogether? \" because all the problems you've linked to & talk about are coming from only crop production & a few from badly managed livestock production, therefore making reductions in the production of animals like ruminants the worst thing you could possibly do if you believe in what you are saying. Pigs sure, but not cows\n\n\"There's a definite feeling I get from arguments like yours:\" The feeling I get from your arguments is that you've been told lots of stuff about what's damaging the environment & have bought it without question but sadly some of it's not actually accurate. To your credit, you do actually seem to research though & step outside the vegan propaganda world & I really hope you can continue doing so. Even if you don't change from being vegan, there are still a LOT of options out there that I think you're missing that have SO much potential, but climate change has become an industry & such a strong movement now that some of the legitimate solutions are not even being noticed. We could fully reverse climate change within a decade with minimal changes though holistic grazing, but we could also reverse climate change within a decade by better allocation of currently available money into legitimate climate reversing strategies such as bio-char. If all tree planters out there were instead sent out to \"rake the forests\" & pack that leaf litter into drums with only 1 small hole in them & then put onto a fire to remove everything except the carbon from that drum & that bio-char then thrown back into the forest, they would actually have a MUCH bigger impact on reversing climate change than they are today!\n\nChina has stopped taking recycling from the developed world & so paper materials for recycling are currently building up in massive quantities around the world. If we were to build some bio-char plants & charcoal all that paper waste & then load it onto the back of empty trucks as they go to farms to collect produce, then dump it all into the cropland, where it will hold 70 times it's weight in water, as well as retaining fertiliser & so reducing the need for fertiliser applications & irrigation, we could seriously impact carbon levels in the atmosphere, since we would be locking all that paper carbon out of the atmosphere for 1000+ years! All while increasing food production from the same amount of land! Those bio-char burners can even be designed to burn using the wood gasses that escape during the burning process, so there's not even any carbon emissions needed to do it! There ARE options to REVERSE climate change! We can get atmospheric levels back down to pre-industrial levels within 10 years & very easily, but you need to remember that none of the ways we can do that are new! Bio-char was used in terra-preta before whites even arrived in America! Holistic grazing is 300 million years old, so since we've known about climate change for decades now & still not carried out these reversing actions, it's important to ask why not & to ask what is causing the problems & therefore what can we GENUINELY do to get this problem fixed in the limited time we now have left & holding out for a unicorn is just not helpful for anyone other than those wishing to profit from disaster & don't make any mistake about this, people ARE doing this for profit & they ARE profiting from disasters! The sheep need to wake up & fix this problem from a grass roots level! If you don't want to eat meat that comes from regenerative animal agriculture, then add bbq charcoal to your shopping list each week & bury it in your own backyard & then begin burning it in your community, anywhere that trees look like they might be suffering from a lack of water, anywhere that looks like it could have pollution run off issues, take a little garden trowel, make an opening, put the charcoal pellet in & close it back up again. Do a bag every week & have all your friends join you to do the same. Go to grasslands near you, go to forests near you. If everyone does that or the meat for a decade, this problem will be fixed!\n\n\"a reduction in meat consumption even in just the world's wealthier nations would contribute tremendously to slowing climate change\" ONLY if what it's calories were replaced with was more beneficial & you have suggested no foods that meet that criteria. Switching from factory farmed to grass fed & therefore forcing conversion to efficient grass feeding systems will do FAR more to reverse climate change than trading meat for beans or almonds! Both those options & almost all others, with current agricultural practices would result is FAR HIGHER greenhouse gas emissions than grass fed meat will! You seem to forget that you are still farting out all that methane when you eat the beans instead of the cows. Your methane is only lower than the cow because you only ate a tiny fraction of the bean plant. The rest of that bean plant was either burnt or broken down by microbes & in the process gave off exactly the same amount of methane as it did when it was broken down inside the cow. The difference being that because the cow wasn't involved, the fertiliser used to grow it emitted nitrous oxide, an ozone destroying greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than CO2!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilac Lizard", "channel": "UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGkX_HWGU7YQWfd4S7JjzOYt1udApZCOIIE1ZG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

At an avg of 15k miles per year the 25 gallon delta between 40 and 15 means 600 gallons of gas difference. 600 gallons create 19.4 to 19.6 lbs of CO2 each for a total of 11760  extra lbs of CO2 in just one year. Per car. That doesnt even address all the other trace gasses and nitrogen oxides that come from the same gallon. 11760 times 100,000,000 is over a trillion lbs of carbon that didn't need to go there. \n\nThat's the simple math, you can handle that right? According to Scientific American April 09. Releasing a \"trillion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere may cause a most likely peak warming of 2 degrees C which many identify as the danger point.\" But that's back to CO2 alone. Ot doesnt account for the many other greenhouse contributors....or the other stuff coming from tailpipes.\n\nSame article references emissions must be below 1990 levels by 2050...meaning U.S. must cut by 90% and on path to zero emissions. Of course a 1 or 2 degree rise will already be calamitous. Shall I go on?\n\nAlso, lest you wonder, there's approx. 1.42 billion cars in operation worldwide.

To prevent this we can allow for controlled fires to burn off this fuel load (this is often considered risky around populated areas) or we can remove this fuel load manually.

Kamala Harris, (D-Calif.) Elizabeth Warren, (D-Mass.) Bernie Sanders, (I-Vt.) and even former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, (D-Tx) four of the most prominent announced or prospective candidates for President.\n\nThe goal of the coordinated barrage appears to be undermining the nascent candidacies through the dissemination of memes, hashtags, misinformation and distortions of their policy positions.\n\nBut, the divisive nature if many of the posts also hints at a broader effort to sow discord and chaos within the Democratic Presidential primary.\n\nSo, just like in 2016, there appears again to be a coordinated anonymous attack underway, focused on finding real fissures in the Democratic party and blowing them up into the most extreme chasms possible. So as to maybe sway the election but potentially to sway Democratic voter's enthusiasm for this race, and certainly to turn them against eachother.\n\nBut, whereas the 2016 campaign was marked by the creation of thousands of fake social media accounts that would ultimately be fairly easily identified as bots, this time the effort is a little bit more advanced;\n\nSome of the accounts are believed to be highly sophisticated synthetic accounts operated by people attempting to influence conversations, while others are coordinated in some way by actors who have identified real individuals already tweeting out a desired message.\n\nTens of thousands of other accounts then work in concert to amplify the core group through mentions and retweets to drive what appears, on the surface, to be organic virality. \n\nThis looks just like what we saw in the 2016 campaign, the social media side of the information warfare against the Democrats and helping Trump, by Russians and by the \"Four-chan,\" community.\n\nAnd, once the primaries are over, and a nominee has emerged, it's only a matter of time before WikiLeaks begins releasing stolen E-mails and other data from their campaign.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "TWSTF 8", "channel": "UC0M2HlpOrYwCptQSh_Uge7g", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkgOwe9ZbeheN3PJYytBK8Jtsg3h5Xht6cTog5AA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The person you're responding to never got into any details, but you're touching on the details... the end point is still the same: taxes on the wealthy were higher, and it worked then. You're building a strawman argument around just the \"90%\" number alone, while still agreeing that it existed. There were a ton of exceptions in it that made it dramatically lower, but stating this just means that NEITHER of you are incorrect, because those taxes were still higher in the end. You are certainly aware that is all these people are saying when they say this, so that error is on you.\n\nAnyways, you're going to have to prove that it's \"much easier now to transfer money, and headquarters, and offices, to other places with less rate\"... because while that is still a concern, it feels very superficial, and probably wrong in general. The USA is a huge market, and regardless of where a company's headquarters are, tapping into that market is going to come with dealing in it's taxes. In addition to this, a lot of production moved out of the USA as the tax rate lowered... 1950 and onward. Was it a trend started by the high tax rates then, or are there a lot more details that contribute to how these things happened? It's business, so certainly the latter. Could a higher income tax on the wealthy work now? ...In conjunction with other tax rates being aligned to make it more effective not to leave: Yes it could. This goes back to your whole point: If it wasn't the superficial \"90% rate\" that made it work, but all the very complicated details and exceptions inside of it... why wouldn't a similar thing, complicated details included, work now? Is it likely to find that balance? I don't know, and you clearly do not either.\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong, but I am saying the crux of your arguments are clearly falling on guesses and misunderstandings.

{"cid": "Ugy5t7aOnewh-BMIoMp4AaABAg", "text": "By the Oxford dictionary definition of emergency—a serious, unexpected, and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action—climate change does not qualify. Yes, it’s important and we need to figure out how to mitigate it, although it’s doubtful we’ll be able to do it in time. It’s not as if Climate Change is a giant asteroid headed for earth as some type of extinction event. Climate Change is more like a slow burn where things get ever-so-slightly warmer over the coming decades and centuries. Folks will ultimately need to find a way to move away from the equator and say goodbye to an inch of beach every few years. What will happen are new patterns of migration as people move to newly-temperate climates from areas that become too hot to live in. The big problem will be fighting over resources as more people begin to occupy smaller and smaller areas of the globe, but that’s centuries away. Besides, who is going to be the first to give up all their modern conveniences—all the things which exacerbate the problem? I certainly won’t.

{"cid": "UgzeGOfAGic5OXtz-yF4AaABAg", "text": "Dr. Seuss warned about climate change aka global warming years and years ago.  Heck 1917 J.R.R. Tolkien began writing what would eventually be published as the Lord of the Rings now know as the Lord of the Rings trilogy in which the evil orcs cut down the forest to build war machines to destroy the Earth.  Sure it was subtle and you probably didn't even realize that Tolkien was an advocate for the trees and conservation when you sat in the dark room with 50 strangers, eating junk food, throwing their paper and plastic trash everywhere and quoting lines like, \"a wizard should know better\" and \"It takes a long time to say anything in old Entish, and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say\" but indeed the evil orcs were cutting down the forest much in the same way the Lorax found greedy people were doing in the book of the same name by Dr. Seuss.  It seems our parents showed us two of the most influential authors of all time and then forgot their message entirely.  We need trees to breath.  If anyone takes a stand on the left or right as they say then they start name calling and labeling them.  I'm an American.  I'm not a Republican or Democrat.  I don't want power for the sake of power but only want a better country and Earth for my children to one day raise their families in.  I don't want to enslave people into making me shoes in a third world country for pennies a day while they live in extreme poverty and then smile and say they are happy to have the work while military forces pocket pay offs to keep them in line.  The things some of these companies do is criminal and they sit in power beside the politicians.  We are blinded by this struggle of two factions to give us a choice so once we become so disenfranchised by one if we choose we can switch to the other when in fact the same people are supporting this system from the curtain and we once again watch a particular television channel and are indoctrinated into believing so much of this crap.  I fell for it with many Americans after 911 and we sent US soldiers into a country for control of oil under the guise of stopping terrorism.  I remember wanting to enlist and going to the National Guard and testing and then my back went out from a car wreck.  My cousin and my step-father's grandson both went to Iraq.  They both came back but they were both different.  My step-father's grandson had been wounded by an rpg and suffered from PTSD.  He committed suicide a few years after returning.  My cousin is still carrying on but he has a PTSD service dog.  War is hell.  Destroying our atmosphere and trees is dumb...just dumb....fossil fuels are harmful if you've ever seen someone huff gas you know this to be true.....no one talks about nuclear detonations but those mushroom clouds can't be good for our ozone.  We are responsible for about half of the detonations many of which were tests not including nuclear power plant disasters like Chernobyl.  As of 1998 we were responsible for 1,032 of 2,053 detonations.  Sorry for seeming to be all over the issues but they are really one issue, what is best for the American people and all of the Earth's people.

No control on pollution until America was forced to do it. After WWII America entered the Golden Age of Consumerism and development.  No one thought it was as bad as it was as well no one wanted to pule back on the reins and take the chance to stalling the economy.  \n\n\nAfter Mao died and Deng Xiaoping took control of the government he recognized how Mao and Mao's form of Communism had no future and proceeded to turn China around in the 1980's. This led to China's Golden Age of Consumerism and it was completely out of control far more than America as China was repressed for so many years. As the situation got worse after 2000 government corruption was off the scales and control was difficult at best. \n\n\nChina even adopted capital punishment for the most extreme cases of corruption in an effort to gain some control.  This took a long time, China is much larger than America. \n\n\nI returned to Shanghai China to set a manufacturing facility in 2007 and I immediately saw so many changes with regulations and monitoring of manufactures.  This was in Shanghai, and when I traveled north to Suqian to visit other factories it was virtually the same as it was in the 1990's!  It was explained to me that it will take more time for the ENFORCEMENT of these new regulations to take effect. \n\n\nFinally about 10 years later the government was finally able to enforce existing regulations and enact new laws to curb not only pollution but corruption.  \n\n\nIts easy for people who have no real knowledge of first hand experience of China to point a finger and criticize.  Once you DO get what the situation really is it becomes clear that its not as it seemed.\n\n\nFurther to the American example of rules and regulations can take good deal of time before they're enforced.  The slaves were freed after the Civil war however were the now former slaved able to enjoy their new \"freedom\" and \"equality'?  NO, they did not, while the federal government had its laws the states and local municipalities had their own, and the federal government could do very little about it...very much like China. \n\n\n\nAs a kid growing up in the 50's and 60's I saw \"Colored Only\" and \"Whites Only\" signs and this was in NY, not the south.\n\n\n\nSo no, I'm not smoking any \"tea\", rather I have first hand knowledge and experience from working overseas for 33 years.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "tihzho", "channel": "UCINGPLbUbrwZKRyWcZqsAHg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRyP5m17iFeyQMorxH-NrEsLHEGCsisO5Nd_CnrwQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nothing he says makes any sense at all; for the most part, it's just a lot of incoherent notions and infeasible ideas that are barely even strung together and usually end up going nowhere. What he often seems to do is dream up some odd, hypothetical situation and then devise a ridiculous proposal to address the imaginary non-problem he's just complained about (e.g., everybody in the world has been \"laughing\" at the U.S. and treating it \"unfairly\" because up to now American negotiators have been \"suckers\" according to Trump) before then mysteriously trailing off into \"We'll see.\" A vague, meaningless expression, but one often laced with menace or allusions to a threat (frequently involving tariffs and messing up another country's economy), that does nothing but create fear and uncertainty.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Martin Rayner", "channel": "UCOt3l44usowctPwM5_qc2aw", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSATOQbNXTkFXvXK0DW_wwL-eLeiUJ-PT3oDi2ZOg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In Science and Education in August 2013, for example, David R.

Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils- Axel Morner, whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work.\"\n\n\"From The National Review: In truth, the overwhelming majority of climate-research funding comes from the federal government and left-wing foundations. And while the energy industry funds both sides of the climate debate, the government/foundation monies go only toward research that advances the warming regulatory agenda.

{"cid": "UgylB1HdzLiAyBCVN-d4AaABAg.8racc2XUmnP8rqTsdHNp7e", "text": " @Mr. Sarcastic Not true, the bible is full of verses about having in excess and not helping your fellow man:  I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” Matthew 19:23-26  The saying was a response to a young rich man who had asked Jesus what he needed to do in order to inherit eternal life. Jesus replied that he should keep the commandments, to which the man stated he had done. Jesus responded, \"If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The young man became sad and was unwilling to do this. Jesus then spoke this response, leaving his disciples astonished.  The \"Eye of the Needle\" has been claimed to be a gate in Jerusalem, which opened after the main gate was closed at night. A camel could only pass through this smaller gate if it was stooped and had its baggage removed. This story has been put forth since at least the 15th century, and possibly as far back as the 9th century. However, there is no widely accepted evidence for the existence of such a gate.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "mjc 427", "channel": "UCfD85Q772TmGQewsWGGbgcw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT0RizvYejUobN35htBUkwFkVHBzxP9mmaj_g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

No one wants that (well, most - sure can dig out some hippy that does). \nThe US government currently gives bucket loads of corporate welfare to fossil fuel companies. Trump is actively trying to stifle green incentives and push fossil fuel back to fore as a solution. If even a fraction of that was given to green, it would be possible to become a market leader.\nWe can't predict the future, but we can take good guesses. \n- Fossil fuels will run out, that is guaranteed. \n- If get Fusion, we can potentially synthesis fuels, to then use fossil infrastructure. But all of the infrastructure for renewables, works better and is more effective with fusion, then combustion. So even if hope get fusion and that'll solve issues, renewable still wise investment.\n- Rest of the world believes in climate change, that is a very large market to sell stuff to...\n\nThey say next 17 years as a no going back tipping point. I believe, If we sit about doing nothing, and does turn out climate change is an issue, and we're past that tipping point.

When Hitler became Chancellor the Nazi party got 43.9% of the vote, which is decidedly less than half the country. They came to power because Germany employs a system of proportional representation, rather than a voting system like that if the US. Hitler and his party then took advantage of a clause in the German constitution called the Enabling Act, which essentially meant that if a majority of the parties voted with him, he could basically declare a national emergency, seize control of the various branches of government, and become a de facto dictator. Because of various issues at the time (many of which were caused by the Nazi party in order to establish that there was an emergency), the parties voted in Hitler's favour, he got what he wanted, and the Nazi rise to power was complete. \n\nImagine that. A leader creating a false narrative to make people believe there is a national emergency, so that they can use the situation to seize power and/or get what they want. I wonder which 45th President of the United States could be doing that as we speak?
