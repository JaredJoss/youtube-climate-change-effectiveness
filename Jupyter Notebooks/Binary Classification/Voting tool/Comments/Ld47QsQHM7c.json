Our polar north is somewhere in Siberia right now. It isn't in what we know of as the north pole.. And what happens at our poles? Everything freezes.. So if the poles move, the old poles will naturally thaw and the new poles will freeze over. If it stops in Siberia, cool.. That's frozen anyhow. It might head down by Japan too though, freezing over the Sea of Japan.\n\n\nThe point is, the polar shift is why Antarctica and the Greenland are thawing out right now.. Once it settles, the new poles will freeze over and things will return to normal pretty much. The Equator will adjust too slightly, which will make some regions permanently warmer.

How is it that, according CO2 can increase 12 ppm, about 3%, and the earth cools.\n \nUSA's NOAA data demonstrates the current climate trend is one of fewer intense storms versus the number of tropical storms. The ratio of Hurricanes (> 120 kph winds) to Storms (>65 kph winds) has been on a downwards trend now for 150 years. \r\nThat the oceans have become calmer is supported by the work of Klotzbach and Landsea (2015) who reported 5 years ago \"the global frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a downward trend between 1990 and 2014.
