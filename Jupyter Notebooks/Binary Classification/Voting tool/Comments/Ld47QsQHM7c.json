Our polar north is somewhere in Siberia right now. It isn't in what we know of as the north pole.. And what happens at our poles? Everything freezes.. So if the poles move, the old poles will naturally thaw and the new poles will freeze over. If it stops in Siberia, cool.. That's frozen anyhow. It might head down by Japan too though, freezing over the Sea of Japan.\n\n\nThe point is, the polar shift is why Antarctica and the Greenland are thawing out right now.. Once it settles, the new poles will freeze over and things will return to normal pretty much. The Equator will adjust too slightly, which will make some regions permanently warmer.
