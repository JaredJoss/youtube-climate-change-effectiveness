{"cid": "Ugyav_sHg7wm2Dse-D14AaABAg", "text": "HOW TO EXTEND THE DATELINE OF EARTH‚ÄôS POLE SHIFT ?\n\nToday, there is no promise fulfilling people, scoundrels are getting dignity and honor, incapable and worthless are becoming the leaders, deterioration of modesty, ladies becoming naked even though they are wearing gowns, increasing sodomy and adulteration, increasing bustards on earth, boys and girls engaging in illegal sex even before puberty, flattening of earth, earth becoming illuminated and decorated, spontaneous destruction of crops, entering wild animals into human inhabitations, engulfing of land by seas, quick passing of time, remaining the Arabic text of Quran without Its soul, Mosques of Arabic Quran reading Fujjar become huge buildings where there is no Guidance, scholars of Fujjar become the worst creatures, etc. These are all indicating the Last Day (Doomsday) as taught by the Three-Time-Knower Lord through His Messengers. Lord has taught through his Messenger that during the Last era, the concentration point of men will be women. But today, it has become worse than that, the daughters are being raped by their fathers and grandfathers.\n\nIt is told in verse 6: 158: ‚ÄúWhat they are waiting except the Angels come to them or your Lord, or some of Lord‚Äôs signs come? Belief in them will not benefit to any soul who has not believed in them before, nor have they earned some good through their faith‚Äù. Now only the Ten Crucial Signs of Doomsday are remaining to appear that are taught by Lord through His Messenger. The Ten Crucial Signs of Doomsday are: ‚ÄúThe sun rising from the west, the appearance of Antichrist, the second coming of Jesus, the smoke which spreads throughout the earth, the coming of the Beast from the earth, the appearance of Gog & Magog, the earth downing to deepness in three places (one in the east, other in the west and third in Arabian Peninsula), the fire from Yemen which leads the people to ‚ÄòMahshara‚Äô (the final Judgement place)‚Äù. \n\nLord has taught through His Messenger that before three years of the appearance of the last pseudo-prophet Antichrist (Maseeh-A-Dajjal), there will be a shortage of rainfall. Rainfall and cultivation will be less 4 by one-third in the first year, and two-third in the second year, and the third year there will be no rainfall as well as cultivation. Plants and trees will dry and wilt. All the water will evaporate, and mankind will be in great agony that even they have to eat their children to survive. Sun will rise from the west on that year, and the duration of that day will be equivalent to one year. On that day Antichrist will appear as the chief of the Israel Army. He will conquer the entire world except ‚ÄòHejaz‚Äô (Provinces including Mecca and Medina of Saudi Arabia). He is the utmost form of Satan with the ability to make rainfall and crops, and make the dead alive, and his sedition and destruction will affect the entire mankind. The Arabic Quran reading Fujjar all over the world who reject Adhikr (the Insight) will become his followers. There will be neither a scholar nor a common man who will not be attracted by the pseudo paradise of Antichrist. Antichrist will make copies of attractive ladies and gents using blood drops by means of cloning. Thus he will fulfill the sexual ambition of the Fujjar. After that, Lord will bring Jesus again on earth as explained in verse 43: 61, and he will kill the Antichrist. Then all the Fujjar (the true disbelievers) as mentioned in verses 4: 150-151 who had accepted Antichrist as a prophet and even as the lord will be killed by the other people belonging to the Messenger Muhammad‚Äôs community. Consequently, Jesus will rule the earth for seven years as Mecca as the capital.\n\nFor a detailed understanding, read the explanation of verses 4: 158-159 from Adhikr which is the Best Interpretation of the Lord‚Äôs Book as mentioned in verse 25: 33. It is mentioned in verses 22: 65; 30: 25; 33: 72 and 55: 7-9 that Adhikr is the Balance and the Trust to keep the universe in its equilibrium. Adhikr is the Splendid Book mentioned in verses 41: 41-43 and the Wise Reminder mentioned in verse 3: 58 through which the Impartial Lord has provided every solution for mankind to postpone or extend the dateline of earth‚Äôs Pole shift and thus increase the life of the universe. \n\nSince this is the Last Period, the aim of publishing this book is to keep the universe in its equilibrium and forming harmony with mankind. So, it is an inevitable duty of those who receive this book to propagate among the whole of mankind irrespective of nation or religion.\n\nFrom the Book \"HOW TO EXTEND THE DATELINE OF EARTH‚ÄôS POLE SHIFT ?\"\n\nwww.straightpathonline.com", "time": "6 days ago", "author": "Huda Adhikr", "channel": "UC8A-5HAbG_SOk0K1Xm4Mu6Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQhSGCMAukR2nf_p4cGiGSaF1y69ZIoAIKH8gslKzG-lhHNvA15t0h8cgXvndJ3=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyW6N-Q5ZorVOsKDY94AaABAg", "text": "Only through Jesus the Christ the only begotten Son of God you can be saved because John 3 says: \n\n3 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: \n\n2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.\n\n3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\n\n4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?\n\n5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\n\n6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\n\n7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.\n\n8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\n\n9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?\n\n10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?\n\n11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.\n\n12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?\n\n13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\n\n14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:\n\n15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\n\n16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\n17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\n\n18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n\n19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\n\n20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\n\n21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\n\n22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.\n\n23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.\n\n24 For John was not yet cast into prison.\n\n25 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.\n\n26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.\n\n27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.\n\n28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.\n\n29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.\n\n30 He must increase, but I must decrease.\n\n31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.\n\n32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.\n\n33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.\n\n34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.\n\n35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.\n\n36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\n\nJohn 3\n\n\nWhat is written above and below is the truth because Acts 10:34-35 says:\n\n34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:\n\n35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.\n\nActs 10:34-35\n\n\nGalatians 3:28-29 says:\n\n28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\n\n29 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\n\nGalatians 3:28-29\n\n\nColossians 3 says:\n\n3 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.\n\n2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.\n\n3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\n\n4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.\n\n5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:\n\n6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:\n\n7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.\n\n8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.\n\n9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;\n\n10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:\n\n11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.\n\n12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;\n\n13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.\n\n14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.\n\n15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.\n\n16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\n\n17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.\n\n18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.\n\n19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.\n\n20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.\n\n21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.\n\n22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;\n\n23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;\n\n24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.\n\n25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.\n\nColossians 3\n\n\nBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\n\nWhat is written above is only the truth in love.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Smokey Mcb", "channel": "UClKvwdV54CxF4T7R9VK9DaQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/idwMDjbydknTSFiLaxoTqfzqK23TmeJG5r7UPzNjhik4DfedJKqLZPA-u9LpvtELNmC3-7gG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
