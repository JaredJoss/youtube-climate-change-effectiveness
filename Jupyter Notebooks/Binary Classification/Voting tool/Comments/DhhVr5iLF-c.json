I think people should perhaps reduce their meat intake, which is what we're doing in our household, but I don't think it's necessary for everyone in the world to immediately go vegan as you suggest. It's all about balance. \n\nA typical vegan argument... the suffering of animals. Unfortunately, that's how our world works and that happens in nature anyway. I think making animals suffer, and killing them slowly is horrible - I think they should be killed quickly and painlessly where possible.  \n\nThere are all sorts of articles you could send me, and I could send some back too, I just think we should be focusing more on energy production, and fossil fuels... as well as carbon capture.

{"cid": "UgzRMVmHsNxp17iGs9p4AaABAg", "text": "Sir David Attenborough has said that reforesting our lands and feeding our populations with better food using modern technology is the best solution for ourselves and our planet. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/c3bdUk4qa0Y\n\nMany people have believed the carbon dioxide demon when the truth is quite evidently right in front of their eyes. The stripping of forests for plantations and habitats has changed the climate. \n\nThe planet‚Äôs climate has been controlled by life forms for 3 billion years as seen by earths carbon dioxide level of a mere 0.04% against our two neighbours mars and Venus that have 90%+ carbon dioxide. The burgeoning human population struggled to feed its own with grains that caused forests that bound soils and moisture to be ripped up and replaced with dry fields with no topsoil retention. So plant life‚Äôs grip on the climate was weakened and the climate shifted slightly. \n\nThe solution is to return the forests and feed the population at the same time. New plant factories in the Netherlands (53¬∞N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.\n\nBuild plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\nUse cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\nUse goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\nUse agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\nUse marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\nUse minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon‚Äôt be misanthropic. Be positive. Be useful. Help flora and fauna control climate and don‚Äôt demonise plant food (carbon dioxide).\n\nIt‚Äôs now possible with plant factories to make a country like Britain self-sufficient in food and return its arable land to forests. It just requires the focus of resources.\n\nThe individual can also help reducing the rape of forests by moving away from grains into plant and animal fats and proteins with the keto diet and live longer and healthier lives.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Jeff Harmed", "channel": "UCiNa7yDepQw78yq27hNkdPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQbPBg6gp-7JtbrHa-Lt8WakRy_Scr4HF_5PHSW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We Can Reduce Eating Non Vegetarian Foods If Population Is Less\n\nIf population is less, then we can reduce eating non vegetarian foods as it is said that non vegetarian foods are causes of some problems in humans. \nIf some cold countries have less vegetarian foods, then they can import vegetarian foods from other countries who have more vegetarian foods.\nNon Vegetarian foods should be consumed only once a week. We must eat eggs once every week, take wednesday as the day. And on every sunday we should eat one non vegetarian food.\nOn one sunday eat chicken, next sunday eat goat, next sunday eat pig, next sunday eat fish and next sunday eat cow and stop eating meat of all other animals. \nIn india country people do not eat cow and only a few people eat pig, so india on one sunday should eat chicken, next sunday goat and next sunday fish. In pakistan pigs are not eaten, so pakistan on one sunday should eat chicken, next sunday eat goat, next sunday eat fish and next sunday eat cow.\nIf this is followed then the world won't need to do fishing much as because of too much fishing some big fishes like sharks and whales and penguins would get less fishes to eat.

{"cid": "Ugyd4ufX5CF4L7xwyfZ4AaABAg", "text": "10. We Can Stop Eating Sweets, Cakes And Stop Drinking Liquor, Wine And Beer\n\nWe consume sweets and cakes. We make it from many things such as wheat, coconut, etc. and add sugar to it. But what we want is the sweet thing to consume which we are getting directly from fruits. The fruit is naturally sweet. So if we want to consume sweets and cakes, we do not have to prepare it, just we have to eat fruits. So all the sweet manufacturing companies can be shut down. If you shut down a sweet manufacturing company, then so many paper boxes need not be manufactured which are used to pack the sweets.\nLiquor, wine and beer are also made from fruits. So if you want to consume liquor, wine and beer, just eat fruits. If this is followed, then you do not have to set up liquor factories and prepare cartoon boxes for liquors. Send everybody to the rehabilitation centres those who can't live without liquor.\n\n11. To Stop Using Perfumes And Powders Which Is Not A Necessity\n\nWomen's could simply keep a flower in their hair instead of using perfumes and powders. For men, it can't be helped. For bad smell in body both men and women should exercise and sweat, it would reduce the bad smell.\nIf you stop using perfumes and powders, we don't need perfume and powder manufacturing companies. So many perfume and powder bottles need not be manufactured, cartoon boxes need not be manufactured for packing them and transportations can be reduced. All of this would result in less pollution.\n\n12. Could We Stop Drinking Cow's and Buffalo's Milk\n\nWhatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow's and buffalo's milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. \nFor infants whose mother's have died or mother's who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow's and buffalo's milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use lime with tea and coffee. A lime should be cut into a few pieces and cooked with tea and coffee or something else can be used instead of lime.\n\n13. A Manufacturing Company Which Is Not A Necessity For Human Beings, If It Is Stopped, Then We Have The Following Benefits\n\nWhen a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings, if it is stopped, then we have the following benefits.\nThat company which is built in a place, that much land is saved, machines does not have to be manufactured, for machines to operate oil is needed and many other things, for which we have to make oil manufacturing company and all other companies for all other things like cartoon boxes, plastic ropes and plastic cans, registers, pencil, pen, stationery products. To make cartoon boxes papers are required and to stick papers gums are required. To make gums so much dough is needed and caustic soda is needed. If we don't manufacture cartoon boxes then that dough can be eaten. Transportation is needed to deliver things to all the shops. Roads have to be constructed. For transportation we need vehicles and to operate vehicles petrol is needed, to get petrol we have to set up oil rig platforms in the sea or land and to deliver petrol to a petrol pump that petrol is needed to be put in a drum, a plastic drum has to be manufactured and then many ships have to be manufactured for shipping the petrol to all the places. For all this works so much land is lost and so much pollution is created, from that pollution humans, land animals, sea animals, aerial animals and earth is suffering. Also many transportation items which requires huge trucks for transportation a driver has to drive only at night and his day life is lost. Surely at night time driving the driver would become sleepy sometimes and accidents do happen. \nAll of this can be reduced and this will be our benefits if we stopped a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings. When you stop making a manufacturing company then all the problems related with it won't occur.\n\nDue to coronavirus pandemic it would be better if we don't open the companies which are not required as a necessity for humans. It would be help in preventing from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n14. Why We Should Manufacture Less Nutrient Foods Like Horlicks And Bournvita\n\nBournvita, Horlicks should be given to only persons who cannot exercise and are too weak. For others who have deficiency and are not too weak, they should eat natural foods and exercise so that the foods would get absorbed well in their body and their deficiency would be alright. If still they cannot exercise and get tired easily, they could do some light exercises or yoga in their spare time which would take long to get tired. If this is done, we won't have to prepare so many horlicks, bournvita and other nutrients foods like that. So then we don't have to prepare the plastic, glass or paper pack bottles and hence less pollution.\n\n15. To Reduce Television Time\n\nTelevision programs is for 24 hours a day. A human works for 8 hours a day, 1 hour for getting ready in the morning, travelling time assume for 2 hours a day, half an hour would be spent in relaxing, talking to friend's for half an hour, talking with family for half an hour, 1 hour spent in a park and sleeping time for 6 hours. Altogether 19 and half hours are spent for weekdays. So only 4 and half hours are left. In that why television is then for 24 hours. Well non working women's and students going to schools and colleges have extra free time. As television is for 24 hours now, then many students instead of spending their time in studying watch television more and study less. Non working women‚Äôs in their free time instead of watching television could do some other activities. Television should be shown in evening from 7pm to 8pm, cartoon shows should be shown for kids at that time. From 8pm to 9pm teenagers programs should be shown. From 9pm to 11pm programs should be shown for grown-up peoples. If you watch colour television for more than 2 hours, the rays coming from television affects your health and eyes.\n\nAt present due to problems going on in the world, 24 hours news channels are required. So we can keep news channels for 24 hours. Sports channels can also be shown for 24 hours. \n\nOn Sundays television can be shown for 9 to 11am in the morning and 2 to 5pm in the afternoon and 7 to 11pm in the evening.\n\nAlso in a year so many movies are made. In a year there are 52 weeks, so only 52 movies should be produced in one country. One Sunday one movie should be watched. Their should be no production of video or CD cassettes of the picture, only uploaded in the internet, so that if anyone wants to watch any movie again, they can download and watch it again. \n\nAlso if their are only 52 movies in a week, there would be less downloading of movies in the whole world due to which there would be less amount of internet radiation.\n\n16. How Much Should Be The World's Population\n\nHow much population should the world have, that our earth can handle the pollution created by our work in which no harm comes to any living beings and the earth, it should be researched and that population has to be maintained.\n\nFor example if our earth can handle pollution of 1 billion people, then the world should have only 1 billion people only. We would have to have one child only from now on till the population reaches 1 billion. As if everybody had only one child, population will decrease. After that everyone can have 2 children's. When 2 children's are born, then population will increase. When the population reaches 1.5 billion, then everyone should have only one child till the population reaches back to 1 billion. After that everyone can have 2 children's. In this way population can be maintained. \n\nBut if the world doesn't want to keep the population limited, then this would lead to disasters. The world should not want that to happen. \n\nIn countries like india and china population is too much. In china people's are having 1 child only. In india the government has said to people to have 1 child only, but it is not followed. India has to agree to have one child only. Even if india agreed, still it would take a long time to reduce population for both countries. \nTo reduce population fast, this method should be used. \nCouples would be 1st born, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on. In this when a person is marrying another person, and they are 1st and 2nd born and also their father, mother and grandparents are 1st and 2nd born, then they can have 2 children's.\nIf the persons marrying each other are 1st and 2nd born, but the man's father or mother or grandfather or grandmother is 3rd born, 4th and so on, and the woman's father, mother and grandparents are 1st or 2nd born, then they can have 1 children. Also if the man is 3rd born, 4th and so on and his wife is 1st or 2nd born and wife's mother, father and grandparents are also 1st and 2nd born, then they can 1 children.\nIf the man is 3rd born or 4th and so on and also his wife is 3rd born or 4th and so on, then they should not have any children's.\nIf a man and woman are 1st or 2nd born, but both their father's, mother's or grandparents are 3rd born or 4th and so on, then they should not have any children's. In this way population can be reduced fast.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugzw2USrLNq6LV2lcsh4AaABAg", "text": "World Climate And Pollution Problems\n\n1. Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped\n\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. \nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \nWhat about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. Well companies and people's on one side and the earth on one side, which should we save, the earth is more important.\n\n2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\n\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.\nThis must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth's pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won't even have to research on how to clear the earth's pollution.\n\n3. Pickles should not be stored\n\nMost of the people buy pickles to eat, while some make it at home. If pickles are bought from a store then a company has also to make glass bottles to store the pickles. If made at home then still glass bottles are required to store the pickles. \nBut if we make pickles at home and only cook how much is needed for one time then we won't need glass bottles to store the pickles. Glass bottles when manufactured it creates water pollution.\n\n4. We Should Stop Using Makeup Products\n\nMany women's all over the world do makeup. Makeup is not a necessity for humans. Instead of doing makeup to look beautiful, women's should do exercise daily. If they exercise and sweat, eat fruits daily, they would have less dead skins and be naturally beautiful. They could save so much money if they stop using makeup products. If this is done then all the makeup manufacturing companies can be shut down. In this way all the pollution resulting from the makeup manufacturing companies would also be stopped.\n\n5. How To Reduce Transportation In The World\n\nIf one country invents a thing and then exports it to other countries in the world, much transportation is needed. Instead of that the invented thing should be taught to every countries in the world. If done like this transportation would\nbe less needed. Only raw materials should be imported and exported\nfrom one country to another. Countries should not import and export eatable things if it can be produced in their own countries. If one country has excess agricultural food grains, fruits, then only that country should export that things to other countries. If this is done, so much pollution can be reduced because of less transportation.\nIf one country has invented a thing and they would think that if they taught other countries the method to invent that thing, then they would lose profits, but that will not be the case as other countries when they will invent a thing, they will also teach the method to invent that thing to all other countries in the world.\nIf pollution problem was not present then no problem, one country after inventing a thing could transport it to all other countries in the world, but now as pollution problem is present, then this should not be done.\n\n6. Electricity Pollution\n\nWe create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.\nAs I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not a necessity for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. Then maybe we could provide electricity to the whole world from windmill and Solar panels which are not pollutant. If we stopped producing electricity from coal, water, etc., then the pollution resulting from them won't occur. Shouldn't we take this step to protect our earth as already our earth is suffering so much from global warming and climate change. Is their any other choice, I don't think so. \nAt present the world is researching how to solve the pollution problem, it would take how many years I don't know and also would it possible or impossible, God knows. Could we wait till that time when scientists would find how to solve pollution problems and till that the earth won't have a major natural disaster, nobody knows. We must shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans.\n\n7. Free Things To The Peoples\n\nAs I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless and lose their business. \nSo to solve this problem the world has to make food, clothing, shelter, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government's of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people's who have lost their source of income, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.\nMany people's should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming. \nA book must be written about how much amount of food of any type a person should consume, to cook foods half or full, because if we eat too much of a thing then some problems arises due to that. The lands of the companies can be turned back to forests, trees can be planted or turned into a farm.\n\n8. Firecrackers should be banned\n\nFirecrackers should be banned because it is harmful for animals. Animals have different levels of hearing and when we burst crackers which have a loud noise the dogs run away from that place. The dogs may hear the noise more louder than humans. When we fire the rocket cracker up in the sky and it bursts and if any bird is near to the explosion then that birds internal organs are damaged and they die just because of that explosion sound. Also peoples who have asthma illness, they face problems during Diwali. So much papers and threads are used in manufacturing crackers. The persons working in the manufacturing companies also suffer.\nNow when their are animals rights for not harming them, then this step of banning firecrackers must be taken.\n\n9. Hair dye manufacturing should be banned\n\nPeople use hair dye to colour their hairs. The hair dye manufacturing companies after production dumps its waste in rivers or seas which pollutes the water. So all hair dye manufacturing companies should be shut down. For the sake of our planet earth this step must be taken.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The earth goes through natural heating and cooling stages as of right now we are going through a heating stage. Yes it does heat up but humans are drastically speeding this up and making the effects bigger and worse. So many ecosystems can not accommodate to these changes so quickly so they die off just like the animals in the polar ice caps they are sufferings from this. And it‚Äôs mostly because of carbon dioxide and how we use and harness our energy... we have been depleting the earth of its natural resources for many many many many years and still haven‚Äôt actually got a hold and tried to switch to more energy efficient and earth friendly resources. Now concerning the hurricanes and things like that. Hurricanes yes are natural but think about it they happen in warm mostly tropical areas and as the earth heats up more places get warmer and warmer and as the oceans rise there is more water to get sucked up or evaporated which makes a PERFECT place for a hurricane to start therefore causing more and more this is just like wild fires, for example in California they have been burning the forest‚Äôs for well more than 3 years and we still continue to this day to cut down trees which eat up the carbon dioxide for a piece of paper called money. And people just don‚Äôt realize what‚Äôs going on because they wanna be these big rich thugs but just weren‚Äôt informed on what‚Äôs going on and what we need to fix. Our goal is to make and earth that for generations after people and our children will be able to live on not for a lifeless planet that the own humans destroyed. This is very saddening because it is happening today and changes are even bigger and people still don‚Äôt realize. If we don‚Äôt do something soon it will be to late and it would be terrible to live through the changes.

Yet the IPCC (United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has no geologists among the hundreds of appointed authors of its Fifth Assessment Report of 2014 and its Sixth Report due in 2022 (see my Technical Note 2019-10). Thus IPCC incredibly lacks both geological input and long-term perspective.\n2) IPCC‚Äôs very existence relies on public belief in manmade or ‚Äòanthropogenic‚Äô global warming (AGW) by CO2 emissions. Moreover its appointed authors, mostly government and university researchers, are nearly all biased by strong vested interests in AGW, i.e. reputations (publications, lectures) & continuance of salaries & research grants. Similarly, major universities have abandoned their scientiÔ¨Åc impartiality & integrity by hosting research institutes mandated to conÔ¨Årm & act on AGW, e.g. Granham Institute (Imperial College), Tyndall Centre.\n3) The often-repeated ‚Äò97% consensus among scientists that global warming is man‚Äôs fault‚Äô (CO2 emissions) is untrue. It refers in fact to surveys of just a relatively small group of ‚Äòclimate scientists‚Äô (a fairly new type of scientist, with strong incentives for bias; see Bullets 2 & 15), moreover only those who are ‚Äòactively publishing‚Äô.\n4) ‚ÄòClimate change denier‚Äô & ‚Äòglobal warming denier‚Äô are despicable & dishonest terms for ‚ÄòAGW doubters‚Äô. No educated person disputes global warming, as thermometers measured 1¬∞C rise from 1850 to 2016 (with pauses).\n5) The ‚ÄòGreenhouse Hypothesis‚Äô, on which IPCC‚Äôs belief in AGW is based, is that atmospheric gases trap heat. But this old (19th century) notion is merely an idea, not a hypothesis, because it is untestable, impossible to prove in a laboratory as no experimental container can imitate Earth‚Äôs uncontained, well-mixed atmosphere.\n6) IPCC computer models are so full of assumptions as to be extremely unreliable, e.g. forecast warming for 1995 to 2015 turned out to be 2-3 times too high ! A likely reason is that the greenhouse idea is nonsense, as explained in recent publications by several scientists. See Bullet 19 for an equally drastic failure of IPCC models.

Evolution Ô¨Çourished, CO2 enabling plant photosynthesis, the basis of all life. Extinction events due to overheating by CO2 are unknown.\n8) Through the last 12,000 years (our current Holocene interglacial period), CO2 was a mere 250 to 290 ppm (parts per million), near plant-starvation level, until about 1850 when industrial CO2 emissions began, making CO2 climb steeply. Nevertheless CO2 today it is still only 412ppm, i.e. under half of one-tenth of 1% of our atmosphere\n9) Until man began adding CO2 about 1850, warming (determined from ‚Äòproxies‚Äô like tree rings) since the 1600AD Little Ice Age peak was accompanied by slowly rising CO2 (measured in ice cores). A simple explanation is CO2 release by ocean water, whose CO2-holding capacity decreases upon warming.\n10) Supporting this sign that CO2 is a consequence, not cause, of global warming, a published study of 1980-2011 measurements showed that changes in warming rate precede changes in CO2‚Äôs growth rate, by about a year.\n11) Since the 1850 start of man‚Äôs additions, CO2‚Äôs rise has generally accelerated, without reversals. In stark contrast, the post-1850 to present-day continuance of warming out of the Little Ice Age was interrupted by frequent small coolings of 1-3 years (some relatable to ‚Äòvolcanic winters‚Äô), plus two 30-year coolings (1878 to 1910, 1944 to 1976), and the famous 1998 to 2013 ‚Äòglobal-warming pause‚Äô or ‚Äòhiatus‚Äô (Wiki).\n12) This unsteady modern warming instead resembles the unsteady rise of the sun‚Äôs magnetic output from 1901 toward a rare solar ‚ÄòGrand Maximum‚Äô peaking in 1991, the Ô¨Årst in 1700 years !\n13) Modern warming reached a peak in February 2016. Since then, Earth has cooled for 3 years (now April 2019).\n14) The ‚ÄòSvensmark Theory‚Äô says increased solar magnetic Ô¨Çux warms Earth by deÔ¨Çecting cosmic rays, thus reducing cloudiness, allowing more of the sun‚Äôs warmth to heat the land and ocean instead of being reÔ¨Çected. In support, a NASA study of satellite data spanning 32 years (1979-2011) showed decreasing cloud cover.\n15) Vociferous IPCC-involved climate scientist Dr Stefan Rahmstorf (Wiki) of the German government‚Äôs Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, recipient of a US$1 million personal research grant from a private foundation, wrongly said in his 2008 article ‚ÄòAnthropogenic Climate Change‚Äô: ‚Äúthere is no viable alternative ‚Ä¶ [to CO2 as driver of modern warming from 1940 to 2005 because] ‚Ä¶ different authors agree that solar activity did not signiÔ¨Åcantly increase‚Äù during that period. Yet nine years earlier, in 1999, famous physicist Dr Michael Lockwood (Wiki; FRS) wrote, in ‚ÄòA Doubling of the Sun‚Äôs Coronal Magnetic Field During the Past 100 Years‚Äô, published in prestigious Nature journal: ‚Äúthe total magnetic Ô¨Çux leaving the Sun has risen by a factor of 1.4 since 1964‚Äù and 2.3 since 1901 !! See for yourselves the striking overall 1964-91 climb in solar-magnetic output, recorded by the strong overall fall in detected neutrons (proportional to cosmic rays), in graph 3 here ‚Ä¶ https://cosmicrays.oulu.Ô¨Å\n16) Lockwood showed averaged solar magnetic Ô¨Çux increased 230% from 1901 to 1995, i.e. more than doubled ! The Ô¨Ånal peak value was 5 times the starting minimum value !

Then ‚Äòsawtooth‚Äô cooling proceeded, through the Dark Ages and ‚ÄòMedieval Warm Period‚Äô, into the Little Ice Age, paralleling a 1,000-year unsteady solar decline; and ‚Ä¶\n18) ‚Ä¶ before that, between 8000 and 2000BC, Earth was occasionally warmer than today for hundreds if not thousands of years, as shown by tree rings, shrunken glaciers, etc.. Then unsteady cooling from 3000BC into the Little Ice Age paralleled unsteady solar decline following the Holocene‚Äôs ‚Äòsuper-Grand‚Äô Maximum near 3000BC.\n19) This 4,500-year cooling contradicts IPCC computer models that instead predict warming by the simultaneous (slow) rise in CO2. This is the ‚ÄòThe Holocene Temperature Conundrum‚Äô of Liu et al. (2014). See also Bullet 6.\n20) Embarrassingly for AGW promoters, the 8000-2000BC warm interval (Bullet 18) was already, ironically, named the ‚ÄòHolocene Climatic Optimum‚Äô, before today‚Äôs CO2/AGW hysteria began. The warmth probably beneÔ¨Åtted human social development. Indeed, it was cold episodes, bringing drought and famine, that ended civilisations.\n21) Cross-correlating post-1880 graphs of solar-magnetic Ô¨Çux versus Earth‚Äôs temperature suggests a 25-year timelag, such that the 2016 peak temperature corresponds to the 1991 solar peak. The lag is probably due to the ocean‚Äôs high thermal inertia due to its enormous volume and high heat capacity, hence slow response to warming.\n22) IPCC, ignoring the possibility of such a time-lag, claims that simultaneous global warming (until 2016) and solar weakening (since 1991) must mean that warming is driven by CO2.\n23) The last interglacial period about 100,000 years ago was warmer than our Holocene interglacial. Humans and polar bears survived ! CO2 was then about 275ppm, i.e. lower than now (Bullet 8).\n24) The simultaneous rise of temperature & CO2 is a ‚Äòspurious correlation‚Äô. Warming‚Äôs real cause was a solar build-up to a rare Grand Maximum, which man‚Äôs industrialisation accompanied by chance. So IPCC demonising CO2 as a ‚Äòpollutant‚Äô is a colossal blunder, costing trillions of dollars in needless & ineffectual efforts to reduce it.\n25) Global cooling now in progress since February 2016 can be predicted to last at least 28 years (i.e. to 2044), matching the sun‚Äôs 28-year decline from 1991 to today, and allowing for the 25-year time-lag (Bullet 21).
