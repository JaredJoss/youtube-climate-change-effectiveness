{"cid": "UgxJCcZb_hyCMU75UU54AaABAg", "text": "The reason people argue about the proposition of climate doom via man made global warming is very simple - not a single piece of empirical evidence exists to demonstrate the notion. Decades after climate headlines went from climate doom resultant of a coming ice age to climate doom via alleged man made global warming no repeatable experiment has been constructed to demonstrate either idea. Even the claim of observational evidence of co2 warming an area of the planet over a decade by Berkley Earth has been pulled apart for numerous reasons one of which being temps actually dropped over the period!!. \n\nYou might think that over the decades an observational facility would have been created to replicate climate variables and how they interact. A mini earth if you will, allowing realistic manipulation of co2 levels to validate or otherwise the claim. But no, nothing of that kind exists and it is easy to see why. \n\nThe IPCC concedes that climate is a chaotic system variables are not nailed down and neither are the myriad of interactions that dictate where the climate will go hence their conclusion that predictions with any degree accuracy are impossible. Computer Climate models are an interesting attempt at juggling what little knowledge there is but even with manipulated temp records they cannot get the warming right bar the notable exception of the russian model\n\n\nWithout empirical evidence and pertinent models there remains only the various predictions to gauge the validity of man made warming doom\n\nBut headline claims buttressing climate fear have all failed. Notably Kilimanjaro still has ice and snow, the Maldives have not vanished under rising seas, the polar ice caps remain and if the Manhattan highway is to be underwater as per the claims of James Hansen, the inventor of the tale, it needs to get a move on because at present rates it isn't going to happen.\n\nIn contrast robust research of over 800k yrs of ice core data irrefutably show warming precedes co2 rise NOT the other way round. Additionally  unadjusted historical temp data does not show continuous correlation between co2 and rising temps. Furthermore modern professional data bereft of manipulation (satellite and USCRN) show nothing unusual in a warming trend that started thousands of years ago after the last deglaciation. \n\nDoomsday via man made co2 is the greatest emperor's new clothes story of modern times future generations will wonder why the scientific method was ditched for failed computer models", "time": "10 months ago (edited)", "author": "Bertie Blue", "channel": "UCGyI5Vb4RPWfeWdBtlPgRbw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRJ_rTYSBHULVC-ghq9rnZ1UyiarxWjT_gMe7aJ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The primary reason that rainforests are being cut down is to make bio-fuels which are carbon neutral and are purchased to meet carbon targets set out by the UN. Forests that were untouched in the US are now being cut down to be used for electricity plants in the US and europe also to meet carbon targets. Vast expanses of beautiful rolling hills in Scotland have been covered by wind farms that use one ton of rare earth metals each to produce.

Maybe we are already in the point of no return where this will produce like a chain reaction to other events very fast with devastating events eliminating a lot of creatures and species on earth as has happened on the past but basically because of os supervolcano eruptions.\n If a shark will kill a man its all over the news..but its not same popular the crimes that we do to millions of animals and creatures to our planet..we are more than 8 billion and we have more than 6 billion cows to feed us..can you imagine if we were not the top predator and another species would use us as we use other intelligent animals for our needs?Do we have the right to abuse and destroy life on earth just because we are more intelligent?And thats another lie..animals are much more intelligent of what most of the people would know or believe.. like crows and octopus that can recognize faces..we are so ignorant, arrogant and destructive..our ego should become much smaller when we realize that we are just a primitive species one of the millions of other intelligent species that live on the universe and forget all the lies that religion and governments are feeding us..", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Spyros Mitrakos", "channel": "UCLn_HlRINUCFi6CvJY4ZeQA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS5sQZxYF55yFG9RL5IRG-x63xfFeCoaT8_eg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

CO2 is part of a natural life cycle on our planet, thanks to green plants and photosynthesis.  The historical record shows a global temperature that correlates to levels of green house gasses in the atmosphere.  Long before human civilization there was a lot more CO2 and Methane in the atmosphere, and there was also a lot more liquid water sloshing around.  Over time and with the proliferation of green plants the atmosphere lost much of its carbon as it was sequestered into those plants and into the ground.  Please do more research.  There are tons of things that can be done in industry and infrastructure that will not only grow economies, but improve the quality of life.  We need to look past possible immediate economic hardships to developing a future that can support a continuously growing human population.

This is well below the average number of sunspots,” the panel said last spring, adding with “high confidence” that Cycle 25 “should break the trend of weakening solar activity seen over the past four cycles.” The panel said the expectation that Cycle 25 would be comparable in size to Cycle 24 suggests that the steady decline in solar cycle amplitude seen from Cycle 21 through Cycle 24 has ended and that there is no indication of an approaching “Maunder-type” minimum. Cycle 24 peaked in April 2014 with an average sunspot number of 82.\n\nDoes everyone understand how screwed we are? This means cycle 25 will be about 70-80% the intensity of cycle 24 and cycle 26 will be non-existent. We are now guaranteed at least a Dalton Minimum level solar retreat and probably much worse.

First of all let's start with the little picture at the beginning where it said Earth survival. That's a cute little thought that is absolutely absurd. The Earth Will Survive, it has always survived and that is not what climate change is about. Climate change is not about the Earth survival, but that little quip is thrown in there to cause alarm and guilt. Next there is a common phrase that the climate is changing. Yes the climate is changing, it has always changed. But then the examples of floods and storms and drops come, and that is climate being confused with weather. Then there's a comment about scientists agreeing about climate change but that is another falsehood. This consensus they are talking about has been debunked repeatedly and if you don't know how are you have to do is Google it and find out. Also there is a matter of CO2 being a greenhouse gas. It has been proven that CO2 is not the cause of climate change, nor is it a major contributing greenhouse gas. In fact CO2 is beneficial to the atmosphere and to life on Earth. Don't be fooled by this propaganda called a documentary on climate change.

It is unlikely that any of this warming is down to a stronger greenhouse effect, but if any of it is, the proportion of the greenhouse effect caused by CO2 is so small that it can be safely ignored. What causes the greenhouse effect? During the day, it is all caused by the ozone layer and clouds. During the night, most of it is caused by clouds. Not only is the heat reflectivness of clouds stronger than that of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, but the cloud cover is really substantial. Google \"Earth from Space\" and see how much cloud cover there is. Most days it's between 20 and 40%. Now compare that with CO2 cover at 0.04%. Yes folks that is one twenty fifth of one percent.

{"cid": "UgzFqPBPTdh5HRWAsnV4AaABAg", "text": "Ah, yes.  First it was called global warming, but because people were not seeing much evidence of unusual warming, and the climate models failed, they simply call it climate change.    What an easy way to reposition a crisis to align with what happens naturally to the earth, so you can always claim you are right.  All you need is to get the media propaganda machine going,  make big dramatic movies and select imagery to show what you want,  get the uncritical youth all riled up, and make bogus claims about what \"scientists\" are saying (being careful to shut out any scientists with opposing views) and you have yourself a nice little crisis you can exploit for political purposes.   Alexandria Occasio Cortez' own political manager is on record for admitting that their new green deal is more about political usurpation than the environment!\n\nThe alarmists have been so effective with their propaganda that people don't even see the evidence under their own noses.  Here in Canada we've had the coldest weather ever the last few years.  We have been consistently getting colder Springs and Falls for the 4th or 5th year in a row now.  Last Winter was very cold in Eastern Canada, with no thaw, causing huge flooding of our rivers in Spring.  This very Fall is the coldest on record, with early snows in the prairies, a cold October in the east and forecast for an unusually cold November.    I think that we are experiencing global cooling as the next ice age is upon us, just like all the climate experts and alarmists claimed in the 1970s!!  Of course, the climate alarmists always deny their opposition the ability to use actual weather phenomena, claiming things like \"localized effects\" etc- effectively shutting out any inconvenient facts that don't align with their narrative.  If you ask me, Canada occupies a pretty large chunk of the global real estate, so I wonder how the alarmists define \"localized\"?  (They do the same thing when people bring up the global warming period of the ninth century which allowed Vikings to colonize Greenland and North America - somehow the entire Northern Hemisphere is naught but a small \"localized\" area in which weather occurrences are not representative of the globe!  But the occurrence of a hurricane in the Carribean, now that's fit evidence for global climate change!). \n\nThere are no mega-droughts or unusually poor harvests, nor are there more or worst hurricanes and floods than before.  Only the usual weather events we've always had.   I love how they show dramatic images of glaciers receding, but never mention how the glaciers were doing this in the 1920s and 30s (there are many dramatic images from that era showing this - all this hype is nothing new!).     What we do have are unprecedented levels of populations occupying every nook and cranny of earth, exacerbating pressures on natural resources as well as ecological niches.  Large swaths of forestlands are being cut down, concrete cities expanding all over the planet - all of these things create localized heat sinks an affect drainage patterns for water, making lands less arable.  More people are living in fragile environments and coastlines where natural weather phenomena are most keenly felt.  In my lifetime the earth's population has more than doubled - with the largest increases in vulnerable third world countries - so no wonder more people are being impacted by whatever powder the weather blows our way!\n\nIs climate changing?  You bet - its done that for a loooong time.  Do humans impact the earth?  Sure we do, but what of it?  We always adapt and do just fine.  Taxing us and destroying our economies will not improve the lot of humans on earth, will not change the weather one iota - quite the contrary, it will make us less able to adapt.  The solution is not to propagate panic, but rather, to seek solutions to real problems, such as overpopulation, pollution, etc.  Everyone is so obsessed with carbon that you don't hear them talk about those issues.  I suspect it has to do with the fact that carbon hits at our economic base and is a more powerful tool to exploit for globalist political purposes.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Jack Rabbit", "channel": "UC4HdSiekyzodraQnW6WnoIw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/JWpQSxCiqXLC3HwH0HX9PbmWsE34R44XDV9uZndQPKDdQkh0jE0ShO9Lv2OTb-ZHKqj_gPZV=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and reflects some of it back to the surface, acting as a sort of ‘blanket’ that warms the planet. That’s the greenhouse effect; it is what makes life on Earth possible.\n\nWhen we burn fossil fuels (as we have been doing since the industrial revolution), we release excess CO2 into the atmosphere, which accelerates the greenhouse effect and causes the planet to warm at an increased rate. That’s called anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming.\n\nThe planet’s climate is heavily influenced by the global temperature, so when there is a change in that temperature, the climate changes as well. That’s the climate change part.\n\nNow, the planet’s climate changes naturally. It always has and it always will. This can be due to a range of factors including increased or decreased solar activity, changes in the Earth’s orbit, changes in the Earth’s axial tilt, etc.\n\nWhen the climate changes naturally, it occurs over periods of tens of thousands of years, which is plenty of time for life to adapt to the changing conditions.\n\nSometimes, a cataclysmic event will happen that alters the climate so drastically and rapidly that mass extinctions occur; like when a massive asteroid struck the Earth, sending an enormous cloud of dust and debris into the atmosphere which shrouded the surface and prevented sunlight from getting in, causing the planet to cool down extremely quickly. This is (most likely) what killed the dinosaurs. If there is rapid, large scale climate change, many life forms cannot adapt, and die off.\n\nThe climate change that we are seeing now, which is caused by anthropogenic global warming, is occurring at an unprecedented rate. We have seen nearly 1 degree of warming in less than 150 years. That is NOT natural. It may not sound like a lot, but, again, that kind of warming usually happens over tens of thousands of years, not hundreds. \n\nIf we allow it to continue at this rate, life as we know it will not be able to survive, We are very finely adapted to certain environmental conditions, and we are altering those conditions.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "John Hazenhousen", "channel": "UCAInveimE6y_4Aj63xDUwmg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTHxP6cGjbCjp-90XSSdRmuoHM9opb4mAf6ZYKL=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzxoBWeA-IfIFidPuN4AaABAg", "text": "Currently I am looking at a number of youtube documentarys and TED talks etc. I am still undecided at this stage. There are a number of aspects that are ignored in the IPCC report. All 15 parameters point to an increase which follows the theory of warming of the planet. However, is it the direct cause of warming or is it the follow on effect of 'something else' causing the warming. A few examples for all of us to think about: 1. Our planet has steadly gained mass through space dust/astroids/meteors (approx 400 tons/day, I read somewhere) and also the rotation of the earth is slowing down because of the moons drag on the sea and liquid magma. Result is greater pressure at the core of the earth. Squezze something, it gets warmer. So, is the heat at the core warming the ocean? 2. The amount of jet airline travel around the world follows the same time period as the carbon increase. Is the hugh volume of jet engine exhaust as a vapour (read aerosol) causing an insulating effect on the startosphere and causing warming of the air which then warms the water which falls to the sea so warms the oceans. 3. The amount of soot in the air lands on the lovely fresh, white, ice on the glaciers and poles. Grey ice  absorbs more of the suns energy and heats the ice, causing it to melt into the sea and warms the oceans. 4. Something still unexplained today caused the Siberian region to become permanently frozen as evidenced by frozen Mammoths with grass in their stomachs. Now it is returning to 'normal'? 5.  Can you readers add a fifth or sixth idea that I have not thought of? Don't forget that a whole lot of intelligent scientists predicted one of Saturns moons would be cold and a minority said it would be hot. The minority were proved correct, because they looked at the  planet using basic science: the interference from the other moons and the moons orbit was going to cause the moon to be compressed and uncompressed. This would cause it to heat up. Regardless of what's causing the change: forewarned is forearmed.

So I'll ask again one final time (This is really hard work by the way). So, what does the empirical Antarctic ice bore data tell us? \n\nAlso, whilst we are on........ what does Fort Denison, Sydney tell us about the largest body of water in the world? It's on the net if you don't work in that field.\n\nAnd as you are clearly a technophobe, what does the recent NASA satellite data tell us about see levels.  \n\nHow about this one......  what is causing the demise of the Coral around Australia? I'll give you a clue it's not climate change, you may like to ask Prof Peter Ridd. And what happened to Prof Ridd for speaking out?\n\nOr, what' is actually going on with The Great Lakes in the US, it was claimed that they were supposedly running dry because of climate change. But the weather had nothing to do with it?\n\nOr, what is happening to the sea around Scandinavia?\n\nOr, why have the number of serious storms  in the US that reach landfall been reducing since 2012?\n\nOr, as Dr David Attenborough claimed are polar bears really dying out due to climate change, or are they thriving, as claimed by Dr Crockford's 5yr study? And what happened to Dr Crockford for speaking out?\n\nOr as Dr Attenborough claimed are walrus's really falling to their death due to climate change or is it simply a case that their habitat is full and they can not abseil?\n\nOr, is farmers setting fires in Brazil for land clearance climate change or is it man made?\n\nOr, what is the relevance of the Hockey stick and why did Prof Mann (climate change supporter) loose at court in August. \n\nYou previously intimated, at least I think it was you, that Tony Heller is a fraud. So what are the facts to back this statement up? I can't wait for this one. \n\nWhy has Obama just bought a sea front property in Maine US, for $15,000,000, when a body he set up to look into climate change said that it will be effected by sea level rise and should be under water?\n\nI have a lot more questions for you but, these will do for the time being, as I have an appointment to keep with my psychologist.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "JC Eyesopen", "channel": "UCRk267_rOODzG89e3DHsTHA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaGSL7Hdo_aYHQimVo0jLiPgydOsngdUDcVw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I have already done the fact checking with quite a few and they don't stack up neither does the science. \n\nHere's a few for you ...........\n\nDr Tony Heller, very clever man \"Evaluating the integrity of the official climate change records\" on YouTube. His channel is a must. \n\nProf Richard Lindzen MIT meteorologist \n\nDr Bill Gray regarded as world leading authority on tropical meteorology. \n\nProf Judith Murray\n\nProf Piers Corbyn a well-known and respected British meteorologist with the best record of accurate, long- range weather forecasting (WeatherAction.com) points out that the world is now cooling, not warming. \nHe contends that: \n“There is no observational evidence in the thousands and millions of years of data that changes in CO2 have any observable effect on weather or climate in the real world. There are no scientists in the world who can produce such observational data, and we challenge anyone reading this to send us such observational evidence from the real world or find someone who can and get them to produce it. There is only effect the other way, namely that ocean temperatures control average CO2 levels due to basic laws of physics about the solubility of CO2 gas in (sea) water.” \nCorbyn believes that because the low incidence of sunspots we are seeing now is similar to the Maunder Minimum from 1645– 1715 and the Dalton Minimum from 1790– 1830, we could well be at the beginning of another mini-Ice Age, a prolonged period of cooling which could last for thirty years or more. \nThis would be bad news for the world. It would reduce agricultural production, raise food prices, and negatively impact the economy in other ways. \n\nProf Hal Lewis. Another prominent scientist, resigned from the American Physical Society (APS) in 2010 after noting that this society had been taken over by the unscientific global warming hysteria. He stated in his letter of resignation: \n“The global warming scam, with the (literally) trillions of dollars driving it, that has corrupted so many scientists, has carried APS before it like a rogue wave. It is the greatest and most successful fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist.” \n\nProf Patrick Moore ecologist and founder of Green Peace, who is still waiting for a climate change supporter to debate him. \n\nFriends of Science - 500 scientists sent letter to UN stating that there was no climate emergency. Not mentioned in MSM. \n\nPro Richard Tol - ecologist and formerly worked for IPCC\n\nPhysicist Dr Willie Soon.\n\nPhysicist Dr Elliot Bloom\n\nProf William Happer - one of the worlds leading experts in radiative transfer physics. \n\nProf Andy Pitman-  ARC Climate Centre university of Sydney - No link between climate change and drought. If you look at the data over the past 100 years there is no drying trend. \n\nPro Peter Ridd sacked from his university for going public about disproving climate change was not responsible for damage to the coral reefs. Sued and won. \n\nProf Joanna Haigh Atmospheric Physics, Imperial College London, \n\nProf David Bellamy,  Botanist and environmental campaigner, employed by BBC, linked the earths temperature changes to the activity of the sun. He was replaced at the BBC by David Attenborough. \n\nProf Tim Ball\n\nPro Murray Salby.\n\nDr Susan Crockford 5yr study into Polar Bears and walrus's. \n\nDR Madhav Khandekar - former reviewer expert for IPCC. \n\nDR Joseph Postma - Astrophysicist \n\nCraig D. Idso is the founder, former president and current chairman of the board of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.\n\nHere's just a few more.\n\nDr. David Evans, Dr. Joanna Simpson, Dr. Alrude Allegre, Dr. Tafd Murty, Dr. Chris de Freitas, Dr. Kiminori Itoh, and Dr. Andrei Kapitsa. \n\nI can also provide you with the names on a petition in America which over 32,000 scientists have signed against the alarmist narrative. \n\nI also have details of retired NASA scientists who are opposed to the narrative. \n\nBy the way many of these scientist named above are world renowned and the top in their field, not just some undergraduate or graduate with a PHD. \n\nEnjoy!!!", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "JC Eyesopen", "channel": "UCRk267_rOODzG89e3DHsTHA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaGSL7Hdo_aYHQimVo0jLiPgydOsngdUDcVw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There are some 1985 talks/interviews that are still on file, saying the increasing change in just one monitored gas does not equate to GW. There is some weather change, but what is causing that? 1972 at Baring Head, NZ using new technology 326ppm of CO2 was measured and now it is 409ppm. About a 25% change over 47 years. Is the extra CO2 produced by the burning of fossil fuels driving the weather or is another factor causing the observed weather change? eg. say it was a release of heat from the earths core, due to the outer electrons in the atoms being pressed closer to the nucleus, well, who is monitoring that? So IF that were to be true, no amount of CO2 reduction is going to change the weather patterns. Regardless: This planet from the day it was created, is on a one way trip, which involves constant change. What humans do in between, is just a 'very short moment in time' and the earth will still die in millions of years time as our sun swells and boils off the atmosphere. I'd rather that we as a struggling species, focused on how we can live as long as the dinosaurs, by accepting our finite resources and making universal decisions to limit population size that sustainably supports everything on the earth. That may give us the chance to travel further out to Mars and colonise it, as our earth becomes less habitable.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "David", "channel": "UCbC5-CcJ3m9A75UIgHIM_tw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSY1JudC-DuGhM__AmnmVvtoTp6zRVupHsr6w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugy-dxpbHYJ2ODrd6LZ4AaABAg.8u6fgEzoFbO91CYMc-O3L8", "text": " @Arthur Giles  About 360 million years ago, some plants evolved the ability to produce lignin, a complex polymer that made their cellulose stems much harder and more woody. Thus, the first trees evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history. \r\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called coalification. Coalification starts with dead plant matter decaying into peat. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon. Thus first lignite (also called \"brown coal\"), then sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed. \r\nThe wide, shallow seas of the Carboniferous Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods. The exception is the coal gap in the Permian–Triassic extinction event, where coal is rare.

The problem that you have is that the basic physics that explains global warming is very simple and for most people easy to understand. There is no debate about CO2 being a greenhouse gas. There is no debate that buring fossil fuels has increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. There is no debate that the temperature of the earth has increased.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "dave evans", "channel": "UCDd-ytA6C2DWQ9uDUXrlJyQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTMyz_IBuz2kwpHswWWiEl-RtzT-duMYpaNRQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
