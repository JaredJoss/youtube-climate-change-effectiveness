The weakened jetstreams fail to confine  the cold Arctic/Antarctic air masses within their respective polar regions and the hot tropical air masses towards their temperate and tropical regions at the lower latitudes. Instead, the jetstreams slow and begin meandering far more in large bends whose peaks and troughs dip deeply into the polar regions and deeply into the tropical regions of the lower latitudes. The jetstreams than drag Polar cold air masses along the deep bends down into the lower latitudes to produce record cold waves and blizzards and drag hot air masses from the equatorial tropical regions into the temperate and polar high latitudes to produce record high temperatures, drought, and other extreme weather events. During the weak Solar Sunspot minima, the meandering of the weakened circumpolar jetstreams frequently set new record high temperatures and droughts at a given location and record low temperatures and deadly blizzards at the same place in the same year.<br><br> During the last 4,500 years there have been more than 70 natural climate change cycles, and the current weather and climate is just another of those natural climate change cycles caused by the Solar variability and celestial mechanics. During those warm climate changes in Britain equally high air temperatures were experienced. For example, Britain experienced one of those extreme heat waves in 1911. So long as the Sunspot cycles over the next cycle of about 11 years =/- n years, do not be surprised to experience alternating periods of extreme cold and hot air masses being dragged across the british Isles by the weakened circumpolar jetstreams. Also note that thermometers and historical temperature records have not been around long enough to observe the normal range of temperature extremes at any given location within or without the British Isles. Consequently, it is commonplace to set new extreme air temperature records in any given region.", "textOriginal": "@Juckya --- Bro.

The weakened jetstreams fail to confine  the cold Arctic/Antarctic air masses within their respective polar regions and the hot tropical air masses towards their temperate and tropical regions at the lower latitudes. Instead, the jetstreams slow and begin meandering far more in large bends whose peaks and troughs dip deeply into the polar regions and deeply into the tropical regions of the lower latitudes. The jetstreams than drag Polar cold air masses along the deep bends down into the lower latitudes to produce record cold waves and blizzards and drag hot air masses from the equatorial tropical regions into the temperate and polar high latitudes to produce record high temperatures, drought, and other extreme weather events. During the weak Solar Sunspot minima, the meandering of the weakened circumpolar jetstreams frequently set new record high temperatures and droughts at a given location and record low temperatures and deadly blizzards at the same place in the same year.\n\n During the last 4,500 years there have been more than 70 natural climate change cycles, and the current weather and climate is just another of those natural climate change cycles caused by the Solar variability and celestial mechanics. During those warm climate changes in Britain equally high air temperatures were experienced. For example, Britain experienced one of those extreme heat waves in 1911. So long as the Sunspot cycles over the next cycle of about 11 years =/- n years, do not be surprised to experience alternating periods of extreme cold and hot air masses being dragged across the british Isles by the weakened circumpolar jetstreams. Also note that thermometers and historical temperature records have not been around long enough to observe the normal range of temperature extremes at any given location within or without the British Isles. Consequently, it is commonplace to set new extreme air temperature records in any given region.", "parentId": "Ugwzy1Nx-qugx2LXEg14AaABAg", "authorDisplayName": "Wayne Patterson", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AL5GRJXvTyA9cPdIp7O_ch5YyNEbu5z7H2eBSex7Qw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQIuwFc11jvVLVIrVi-Gk6Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQIuwFc11jvVLVIrVi-Gk6Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-02-04T14:05:06Z", "updatedAt": "2023-02-04T14:05:06Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "LuOUH8CWK5MRzdNL3H0hGZJue4Q", "id": "Ugwzy1Nx-qugx2LXEg14AaABAg.9lU3XUvGN2o9lhrdjjDUI6", "snippet": {"videoId": "RLqXkYrdmjY", "textDisplay": "@Wayne Patterson Bro.

You have no valid means of knowing a &quot;global average temperature&quot; for any single day, month, year, century, or millennium with an accuracy to the nearest whole degree Celsius or Fahrenheit. <br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - now yes PRE-photosynthesis the levels did start much higher but at that time the earth literally just formed after the moon smashing into it so it would have been far too hot to have any major life due to, well, lava everywhere and the lack of life prior to that stage oddly makes the natural co2+steam+ect atomosphere kinda pointless to count as how much co2 existed and so what is meant by &quot;the highest levels since post photosynthesis<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- The atmospheric Carbon dioxide levels are reported by the leading researchers to have been in the 10,000ppm to 6,000ppm ~550-600 mya. Consequently your denial of those levels &quot;post photosynthesis&quot; is false nonsense. <br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - now yes there WAS a spike in the MIDDLE of the idustrial revolution but keep in mind they ALREADY were burning MASSIVE amounts of fossil fuels so the post 1900 levels ARE FACTUALLY higher than ANY pre-industrial levels<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- The 1828-1829 observations of Carbon dioxide at levels up to 574ppm documents the fact you made another false statement and a reckless lie from willful ignorance.<br><br>[John the Fact Fddict  - [....]<br><br>3: well since the earth IS hotter than it should be based on KNOWN natural temperature cycles being disrupted which is based on KNOWN human influence of CO2 levels that you say is a lie but offer no data outside of the post-industrial start history I thnk you need to offer data that is not in the middle of the very thing that caused the spike<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- The evidence is the fact everything you have stated is based upon fantasy rhetoric and imaginary temperature numbers. <br><br>[...deleted nonsense so the response is short enough to post]<br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - <br>I am so confused why you deny known and understood factors.<br><br>are you just so scared of the truth that you are in denial?<br><br>the earth is warmer than it should be, fact<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- Your supposed &quot;fact&quot; is actually fiction. First, you do not know what the Earth&#39;s fantasy temperature is supposed to be. Second, you do not know and cannot know what the earth&#39;s temperature is or was with the necessary accuracy to detect the claimed temperature difference/s. Third, you cannot know what temperatures should be, because your fantasy claim to know a fact about the Earth&#39;s temperatures  is actually based upon imaginary temperature numbers. <br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - the co2 is a major factor, fact<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- False claim due to the mass of Carbon dioxide emissions and quantities in the remaining know fossil fuels are physically incapable of increasing atmospheric concentrations greater than around 600ppm. Levels of around 600ppm have no significant effect upon atmospheric temperatures.<br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - humans are a major factor for the co2, fact <br><br>Wayne Patterson --- &quot;humans&quot; are responsible for only about 3-4 percent of the Carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the fluctuations in the populations of various invertebrates such as termites result in larger changes in Carbon dioxide emissions than the entire Human emissions. Furthermore, the Human impacts upon the prehistoric Biosphere reduced many natural Carbon dioxide emissions, and the net balance of those emissions offset a significant fraction of the already negligible Human emissions.  Your alarmism about the Human emissions amounts to irrational scaremongering. <br><br>[deleting more nonsense]<br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - you want facts? I can easily find them if you ask politely rather that assert with no <br><br>evidence that I lied<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- Your assertion &quot;with no evidence that I lied&quot; is also a lie. Your statement is a lie because you already knew that you have never performed the empirical observations of the temperatures that were used to compile a fictional &quot;global average temperature.&quot; You have never performed a review of the temperature datasets and their temperature data to exclude any and all imaginary and unobserved temperature numbers. You have never performed the calculations necessary to correct the accumulated errors which result from compiling the TAVG numbers to create the fantasy &quot;global temperature averages.&quot; In other words, you claim to know that certain claims are a &quot;fact/s&quot; and not merely your own opinions based upon the opinions of other people and their false statements of fact. <br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - perhaps my numbers or data is mistaken but to assert that I willfully lied with no proof is slander, undeniable<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- It is self evident that you willfully lied due to your assertions to know the Earth&#39;s temperatures to be a certain &quot;fact&quot; despite your knowing that you have never performed the empirical observations necessary to know the earth&#39;s temperatures with the claimed accuracy.<br><br>John the Fact Fddict  - I could use the legal systems of most lands to force you to be unable to say what you just did<br><br>I simply show data I am right and you get punished<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- Those remarks appear to be an attempt to intimidate and censor rightful criticism of your false statements and outright lies.

Our technology is too inaccurate to observe and measure the atmospheric percentage levels of Carbon dioxide in the tenths or hundredths of a percentage point accuracy necessary to discriminate between Human emission sources and various non-Human emission sources. <br><br>John the Fact Fddict --- or that fossil fuels naturally burn in greater than human scale levels or that the temperature is actually on a general downswing rather than heating up<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- More Strawman Arguments which make no sense at all.<br><br>John the Fact Fddict --- please do not show known examples of charts that climate change &quot;skeptics&quot; that are simply edited to omit all but a small fraction of the data to show the opposite trend or examples of media organizations that have either a financial bias to lie or that have already submitted retractions to false claims, I will find out and show you the truth<br><br>Wayne Patterson --- Your comment falsely accuses Skeptics of doing what the Climate Change Alarmists are actually doing. <br><br>John the Fact Fddict --- we can&#39;t stop climate change anymore and it was factually human actions that pushed us to the peak and beyond<br>the only question is: will we do it again after the earth resets the carbon cycle? <br><br>Wayne Patterson --- That is fantasy fearmongering.", "textOriginal": "\u200b@John the Fact Fddict --- \n\n1: that is a fact we can trace the natural history of \"ice ages\" and normal temperatures and factually if the cycle continued the temps would be on the downswing \n\nWayne Patterson --- Your remarks are false and unscientific statements.

You have no valid means of knowing a \"global average temperature\" for any single day, month, year, century, or millennium with an accuracy to the nearest whole degree Celsius or Fahrenheit. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - now yes PRE-photosynthesis the levels did start much higher but at that time the earth literally just formed after the moon smashing into it so it would have been far too hot to have any major life due to, well, lava everywhere and the lack of life prior to that stage oddly makes the natural co2+steam+ect atomosphere kinda pointless to count as how much co2 existed and so what is meant by \"the highest levels since post photosynthesis\n\nWayne Patterson --- The atmospheric Carbon dioxide levels are reported by the leading researchers to have been in the 10,000ppm to 6,000ppm ~550-600 mya. Consequently your denial of those levels \"post photosynthesis\" is false nonsense. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - now yes there WAS a spike in the MIDDLE of the idustrial revolution but keep in mind they ALREADY were burning MASSIVE amounts of fossil fuels so the post 1900 levels ARE FACTUALLY higher than ANY pre-industrial levels\n\nWayne Patterson --- The 1828-1829 observations of Carbon dioxide at levels up to 574ppm documents the fact you made another false statement and a reckless lie from willful ignorance.\n\n[John the Fact Fddict  - [....]\n\n3: well since the earth IS hotter than it should be based on KNOWN natural temperature cycles being disrupted which is based on KNOWN human influence of CO2 levels that you say is a lie but offer no data outside of the post-industrial start history I thnk you need to offer data that is not in the middle of the very thing that caused the spike\n\nWayne Patterson --- The evidence is the fact everything you have stated is based upon fantasy rhetoric and imaginary temperature numbers. \n\n[...deleted nonsense so the response is short enough to post]\n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - \nI am so confused why you deny known and understood factors.\n\nare you just so scared of the truth that you are in denial?\n\nthe earth is warmer than it should be, fact\n\nWayne Patterson --- Your supposed \"fact\" is actually fiction. First, you do not know what the Earth's fantasy temperature is supposed to be. Second, you do not know and cannot know what the earth's temperature is or was with the necessary accuracy to detect the claimed temperature difference/s. Third, you cannot know what temperatures should be, because your fantasy claim to know a fact about the Earth's temperatures  is actually based upon imaginary temperature numbers. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - the co2 is a major factor, fact\n\nWayne Patterson --- False claim due to the mass of Carbon dioxide emissions and quantities in the remaining know fossil fuels are physically incapable of increasing atmospheric concentrations greater than around 600ppm. Levels of around 600ppm have no significant effect upon atmospheric temperatures.\n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - humans are a major factor for the co2, fact \n\nWayne Patterson --- \"humans\" are responsible for only about 3-4 percent of the Carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the fluctuations in the populations of various invertebrates such as termites result in larger changes in Carbon dioxide emissions than the entire Human emissions. Furthermore, the Human impacts upon the prehistoric Biosphere reduced many natural Carbon dioxide emissions, and the net balance of those emissions offset a significant fraction of the already negligible Human emissions.  Your alarmism about the Human emissions amounts to irrational scaremongering. \n\n[deleting more nonsense]\n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - you want facts? I can easily find them if you ask politely rather that assert with no \n\nevidence that I lied\n\nWayne Patterson --- Your assertion \"with no evidence that I lied\" is also a lie. Your statement is a lie because you already knew that you have never performed the empirical observations of the temperatures that were used to compile a fictional \"global average temperature.\" You have never performed a review of the temperature datasets and their temperature data to exclude any and all imaginary and unobserved temperature numbers. You have never performed the calculations necessary to correct the accumulated errors which result from compiling the TAVG numbers to create the fantasy \"global temperature averages.\" In other words, you claim to know that certain claims are a \"fact/s\" and not merely your own opinions based upon the opinions of other people and their false statements of fact. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - perhaps my numbers or data is mistaken but to assert that I willfully lied with no proof is slander, undeniable\n\nWayne Patterson --- It is self evident that you willfully lied due to your assertions to know the Earth's temperatures to be a certain \"fact\" despite your knowing that you have never performed the empirical observations necessary to know the earth's temperatures with the claimed accuracy.\n\nJohn the Fact Fddict  - I could use the legal systems of most lands to force you to be unable to say what you just did\n\nI simply show data I am right and you get punished\n\nWayne Patterson --- Those remarks appear to be an attempt to intimidate and censor rightful criticism of your false statements and outright lies. Note: the Merriam Webster defines a lie as \"an untrue or inaccurate statement that may or may not be believed true by the speaker or writer.\" Your temperature \"data\" is imaginary due to its fictional origins. \n\n[....]\n\nJohn the Fact Fddict --- what is your evidence from primary peer reviewed studies that shows that co2 is lower than it was pre-industrial revolution \n\nWayne Patterson --- In other words, you claim to know for a \"fact\" that pre-1900 levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide were always observed to be less than the current ~400ppm despite your failure to know about the pre-1900 observations of Carbon dioxide at levels up to 574 ppm. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict --- or that the temps of the planet should be rising rather than falling \n\nWayne Patterson --- Your comment is meaningless given the fact of how the Earth's air temperatures have always  been naturally rising and falling in natural cycles with and without the presence of Humans. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict --- or that humans cannot measure co2 gas output from a known chemical reaction \n\nWayne Patterson --- That comment is a fake Strawman Argument, because I never made such a statement or assertion. Our technology is too inaccurate to observe and measure the atmospheric percentage levels of Carbon dioxide in the tenths or hundredths of a percentage point accuracy necessary to discriminate between Human emission sources and various non-Human emission sources. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict --- or that fossil fuels naturally burn in greater than human scale levels or that the temperature is actually on a general downswing rather than heating up\n\nWayne Patterson --- More Strawman Arguments which make no sense at all.\n\nJohn the Fact Fddict --- please do not show known examples of charts that climate change \"skeptics\" that are simply edited to omit all but a small fraction of the data to show the opposite trend or examples of media organizations that have either a financial bias to lie or that have already submitted retractions to false claims, I will find out and show you the truth\n\nWayne Patterson --- Your comment falsely accuses Skeptics of doing what the Climate Change Alarmists are actually doing. \n\nJohn the Fact Fddict --- we can't stop climate change anymore and it was factually human actions that pushed us to the peak and beyond\nthe only question is: will we do it again after the earth resets the carbon cycle? \n\nWayne Patterson --- That is fantasy fearmongering.", "parentId": "UgzHoIa6XIf0TOGrW-B4AaABAg", "authorDisplayName": "Wayne Patterson", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AL5GRJXvTyA9cPdIp7O_ch5YyNEbu5z7H2eBSex7Qw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQIuwFc11jvVLVIrVi-Gk6Q", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCQIuwFc11jvVLVIrVi-Gk6Q"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-01-29T22:08:26Z", "updatedAt": "2023-01-29T22:08:26Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#comment", "etag": "imoDAg32dYzXQrwdB_CjpJ49qzg", "id": "UgzHoIa6XIf0TOGrW-B4AaABAg.9lM2QJKBqFR9lUNsgk7uxl", "snippet": {"videoId": "RLqXkYrdmjY", "textDisplay": "@Otopon my point was akin to the difference of 0.1c on a working CPU<br>the range of operation is under 100c<br>if you heat the CPU without power above 100c there is no chance of safe startup until it cools under 100c<br>there is no difference if it is heated to 150c or just 110c<br>hence my point is that there is a safe threshold(like how the human body will die above 105f not matter how small the gap above) to all systems including the overall climate<br>if the earth reaches that temp there is a large chance of the human race dying off no matter what we do and only our ability to adapt small spaces to suit our needs will prevent our extinction<br>the earth is pre-heating and we just refuse to turn off the oven and open the door(by which I mean to say we refuse to stop burning fuels even a little and capture that co2)<br><br>who cares what the ultimate end of it is<br>we are fucking it up and people refuse to admit there is even a problem<br>stop denying there is a problem<br>you can disagree on the cause as much as you wish but tehre is a problem and you need to stop denying it<br>no more talking about slight differences in the data<br>the trend is &quot;too fucking hot&quot; and that relates to &quot;too much fossil fuel byproducts&quot; can we fix the problem?

I was arguing against a post that claimed -  \"Also, we'll never be at a stage where there is too little CO2. We are wayyyyyy passed that.\"  I stand by my argument. You are arguing something different entirely. Nowhere were either of us discussing warming. \n\nI will now address your arguments. *\"That's not our concern. Our concern is how the changing climate threatens our civilization.\"*  There is no evidence whatsoever that warming is going to \"threaten our civilization\". This is hyperbolic nonsense. After 200 years of rapidly *growing* fossil fuel use, 200 years of warming and 43 years of abject climate hysteria, data proves that humanity has never been safer, healthier, or more prosperous than at any time in history, *by any measurement you care to examine*. This trend has never been interrupted. Warming has proven to be mostly benign, easily managed and a net benefit for humanity. You are embracing wild hyperbolic speculations of future events that never materialize, while I examine evidence from events that have already taken place. \n\n*\"You know what those large herbivores didn't have that we do?\"*  More accurately they didn't have an ounce of technology. Unlike these herbivores, humanity and fossil fuels created the modern world. It's the modern world that keeps you safe. All one has to do is examine the people who live in abject poverty to understand this. Or simply examine how people lived historically. It wasn't pretty I can assure you. \n\n*\"Populations dependent on stable farming regions in order to sustain themselves.
