This planet will become as we envision it, Our numbers are so many and our capability so large that we are now directly affecting how it evolves and how life here sustains. What this planet will be in 20 years from now will be the result of what we deem important. \n\nOur values morels and priorities will be reflective of the environment we pass down to our children to inherit. Once humanity crosses the threshold of 10 billion the impact we will have will be felt by every single generation of humans born on this planet after that, Which places us at a very precarious position . We are looking down the barrel of a gun knowing what we do or don't do during our life times will create a precedence that will be follow by future generations. \n\nWe must lay the foundations of the world to come, We must begin to steer in a direct to lead the way for future generations to continue with. The threat we now know is very real isn't the only reason for humanities need to become more aware. we are part of this planet and it is a part of us its our home. We have spent all of human history thus far being selfish as individuals, we have nice homes cloths, cars, stuff, etc. Our numbers are so many now that we must being to become a selfish super organism by ensuring we have a nice planet to exist within.\n\n Begin to think of your house or flat as merely a dwelling and the planet our real home. trust me on this if we do this right with the knowledge we have gained thus far the changes we make will create a planet that enhances our experiences lifestyle and lives in ways you cant possibly imagine because humanity has never attempted such things on a scale able to bring forth real change.", "time": "4 days ago", "author": "Chris Lecky", "channel": "UC65z6wn_7KUcRhQZ7lggmUA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTvPJFLPYsl7i3Jn2TQxRKkmxJw7BltatOCgg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They leave out and cherry pick data that proves the point they want to make. The earth had been on a rapid falling of temperature for three thousand years. The majority of earth's history has been in ice ages punctuated by short periods of warming. If you take all of the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere they add up to 1% in total. Of that 1%, 95 % is water vapor. All the rest add up to just 5 percent of one percent. It's true that co2 is rising yet temps are cooling.

Instead of just a becoming a warmer climate to enjoy,  it's been extremely unpleasant. Invasive plants killing our trees like crazy, harmful insects spreading diseases more, extreme temp changes, etc. It's not like the northeast is becoming some warm, pleasant paradise; it's becoming hell.  Ecoli is flourishing in the fresh water.          \n\nI knew something was changing when the Canadian geese began to stay winters. Now half of them stick it out because it's not as harsh, in some ways at least. The deer are rutting late, causing weird birthing times.          \n\nI worry about what will happen in another 10 years. These invasive plants are strangling native plants too quickly.

{"cid": "UgzIMU0RpKis9SdvhWh4AaABAg", "text": "It is impossible to model the effects or even to cover all the aspects of the current extreme climate events in short articles, lectures or video documentaries because of the complexity of the many parameters. Additionally, with so many specialized areas of study, very few looks at the overall 'big picture' encompassing every aspect of the subject of climate change. Just one aspect not considered in models is the huge variation of crustal thickness on land and sea and the huge variation in the structure of soils, minerals, metals and magnetic materials at different locations around the planet. These variations have an immense bearing on the recorded magnetic fields at any one location and the variations generate localized variations at different times as a result of the quantity of magnetic material in each location. As the pole shift progresses, variations in the thickness and quantities of magnetic materials at different locations are already displaying huge localized variations in the magnetic fields around the planet. Currently, as a result of the pole shift, there are two main magnetic north poles and two south poles....these represent the intense poles of the core and the lesser intensity of the poles of the magnetized crust. The geographic poles remain the physical center of the Earth's rotational spin.\n\nHistorically, this planet has seen surges of earthquake, volcanic activity and generally increases and decreases in temperature, but these changes have happened over many tens of thousands of years. Some changes have almost certainly happened suddenly as a result of asteroid strike, pole migrations and pole shift (see the current and predicted accelerating movement of the position of the North Pole at)¬†http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/data/poles/NP.xy¬†and have been accelerated by the effects of excessive plate movements causing extensive earthquakes¬†https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/¬†(then click the cog top right hand corner, select Magnitude 2.5 + worldwide, then twice on the ‚Äì sign on the top left side to see how many earthquakes have occurred in the past month. Earthquakes have increased by 20 times in the past 16 years in recent months! For volcanic eruptions¬†http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/erupting_volcanoes.html¬†activity now up to 79 from 3 sixteen years ago. See also¬†http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/40-volcanoes-are-erupting-right-now-and-34-of-them-are-along-the-ring-of-fire¬†Currently, as a result of the pole shift, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions (79 active volcanoes!) are on the increase and there are over 3,500,000 fissures in deep ocean releasing much greater volumes of greenhouse gases than man produces and pole shift will increase this volume. Hence the spike in CO2 recorded by the IPCC! (It is not us driving 100 times more for the past few years!) So prepare for more earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and more severe climate change in the future!¬† The next pole shift is well overdue and the last one caused mass extinctions worldwide. See also¬†www.magneticreversal.org¬†\n\nOne very good example of the current effects of sea-level rise can be seen with the Florida sea level rise¬†¬†\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjZtdpD2XiE¬†and¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JbzypWJk64¬†&¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqfuie-fCzE¬†where sea level rise is not to do with global sea rise but to do with pole shift as North America moves south towards the bulge of the ocean at the Equator. Coastlines approaching the bulge of the ocean at the Equator are sinking. Coastlines moving away from the Equator are expanding.\n\nIn previous pole shifts, there is now strong evidence to show that leading up to such events, oxygen levels decrease as more poisonous and inflammable greenhouse gases are released from the increased number of volcanic eruptions, deep ocean fissures and earthquakes. In addition, following massive volcanic eruptions, without sun to allow plants to grow converting carbon dioxide to oxygen, carbon dioxide levels increase and oxygen levels fall exponentially. See¬†¬†\nhttp://earth-pages.co.uk/2014/04/17/oxygen-magnetic-reversals-and-mass-extinctions/¬†Wild weather is on the increase monthly.

In many countries, even defense forces are already overwhelmed assisting those suffering from the increase in extreme climate change events. There is a possibility that the world economy could collapse as more and more food and manufactured 'essential' goods become scarce and power grids fail. There has been an increase in civil unrest in an increasing number of countries as a result of the effect of climate change and this can only increase. Tens of millions have already lost their homes, businesses and family members to climate change. At very least governments should warn us all to keep our critical documents in fireproof and waterproof boxes in safe locations and even photocopies in alternative safe havens in the event that an extreme climate event arrives in a previously historically safe area. To re-establish identity and critical documents take time and money at a time when everything else may have been lost. Those living in potentially vulnerable locations such as river banks, low lying coastal homes etc should consider moving as soon as practicable in the event that an extreme weather event occurs in their location sometime in the future.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Terry Moore", "channel": "UC5Kidgpkk3WR33qYsCkF2mQ", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSaqcvPKvNom3lEZtZyt95iJP1ZTYY4E8AGOCpF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzCYNMNWVIh17k16vl4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Although Climate Change (sometimes called ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù) still has its ever shrinking group of naysayers, even the major fossil fuel companies have admitted that mankind has and continues to impact the earth's climate in negative ways, including through the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. It is beyond reproach that the Earth‚Äôs climate is changing in ways that will undoubtedly present negative impacts that will be bourne on some level by every person and business. Many of the scientific models present catastrophic damage scenarios occurring relatively soon - within the lifespan of our children.\n\nThe monetary cost of climate change ‚Äì be it for adaptive actions or failure to adapt, will be enormous, eclipsing the GDP of many developed countries for decades to come. Injury and damage to persons, property, businesses, governments, ecosystems and natural resources, to name but a few, are unfortunately unavoidable at some level. For those interested in a comprehensive overview of Climate Change, including the science, data trends, damages, domestic and international\nlegislative initiatives, financial implications and mitigative measures, I encourage you to read my recent White Paper which you may access through the below link.

If people think the weather is bad now, within 6 months storms will arrive that have the intensity & power to literally level cities, tsunamis that will engulf millions and 10's of thousands of wildfires, far too many to control, which will permanently darken the sky. How fitting it is that the US is right on the frontline, a country which uses 25% of all fossil fuels used on the planet each day, yet only has 5% of the worlds population. undoubtedly the most selfish & stupid nation on the planet, stats recently born out by a recent survey which said that the average iq in America is under 100. However ultimately, nobody and no species on the planet will survive the Holocaust that is coming.....Global Omnicide is a certainty in very short order...\n\n\nAhh, for starters, I can tell you're a moron and have no idea what you're talking about when you say Tsunami's will ravage cities because for climate change, despite the two being completely unrelated.\n\n\nOkay, now, on to debunking you're stupidity.\n\n\n1. No, we aren't, the world has been 10-20 degrees warmer than today in the past 600 million years, Co2 levels have been 17 times higher than today in the past 600 million years, and in the past 400,000 years we've seen temperatures 2-4 degrees Celsius warmer than today, not only that, but our ice caps didn't exist for at least 90% of Earth's history, and sea ice extent, ice cap extent, and glacial extent, has all-today, or much lower, in the past 10,000 years alone. No run away warming, so where exactly do you get that's happening now?\n\n\n2. Within 6 months? where'd you get that from? That seems like an unsupported baseless claim relating to climate, in other words, climate science denial. Don't you dare tell me you're a climate denier!\n\n\n3. 10s of thousand of fires already happen every year, and that isn't unusal.\n \nAt least for the U.S., fire numbers, and acres of wild land burned, has plummeted for the past 80-90 years or so.\n\n\nhttps://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFires.html\n\n\n4. Stupid American's? Let me guess? European?\n\n\nThe average IQ of the U.S. is 98 points.\n\n\nThe average for Europe is 97.\n\n\nThere's only 4 countries in Europe with an IQ of 100 or above, so are the other 40 all idiots as well.\n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/userkuv5srz11.jpg\n\n\n2 States in the U.S. have an IQ of 104 or above.\n\n\n9 U.S. states have an IQ of 103 or above.\n\n\n15 U.S. states have an IQ of 102 or above.\n\n\n25 (50% of) U.S. states have an IQ of 101 or above. In comparison, Finland's, the smartest country in Europe, has an IQ of 101. In other words, 25 states, home to 116 million people in the U.S. are averaging an IQ of 101 or above, while only the country of Finland (with 5.5 million people) is averaging 101 or above in Europe.\n\n\n30 states (compared to Europe's 4 small countries) have an IQ of 100 or above (equivalent to Switzerland).\n\n\n36 states have an IQ of 99 or above (equivalent to that of Germany).\n\n\n40 states have an IQ of 98 or above (the national average of the U.S. and France)", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "John Peric", "channel": "UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT68GrZP4pMCQxFt1i9y17x4aicCUNaqhQ_UrofKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxqTdsfLg6OVmlChEF4AaABAg", "text": "The earth has a heat pump cooling system that uses water as it‚Äôs planetary refrigerant.  The earth receives more energy from the sun then it can radiate off. Water absorbs heat , changes form to gas and rises to the upper atmosphere.  Once up in the upper atmosphere water changes form from gas to liquid or solid and in the process gives off the heat it carried up there from the surface of the earth. At the same time it becomes sub cooled by the coldness of the upper atmosphere and then falls back to earth as a solid or a liquid carrying extra cooling power to the earth. Remember, it is easily about -65 to -85 up there. If you have flown in a jet you know it colder than the poles up there. No wonder when record heat lifts records amounts of water up there, it comes down in record amounts of cold temperatures and snow falls. Sadly, most of the time, it misses the ski areas and falls where people wish it would not.  This is why global warming is so misunderstood when it produces cold record temperature events as well as record heat events somewhere on earth.\n\nTo say that the earth is just going to burn up or just rise in temperature is like saying when you start your car, that the engine is just going to experience engine warming until  it burns up. No , it has a cooling system. With hotter temperatures, the cooling system will work that much harder and faster. So fast that no matter whether nature or man changes the composition of the air to retain heat, it will cool the Earth maintaining a overall temperature that life needs to be here. If it couldn't life would have ended long ago on this planet. This is why in many areas are seeing record floods and snows as other areas are seeing record heat. Usually while one hemisphere of the earth is having record heat, the other is experiencing record cold. When you know how a Automobile engine works you know what it should be doing. When you understand how a planet works, you know what it should be doing. The international Council on climate change should upgrade it‚Äôs Current climate model to one that includes water as a planetary refrigerant that carries heat from the surface to the upper atmosphere and the coldness of space down from the upper atmosphere to the planet. In other words, the earth heat pump cooling system model that uses water as its refrigerant. Does any of your scientists have any practical experience in Refrigeration and HVAC engineering ? If not, this will probably not make sense to them. In other words, if you don't know how your refrigerator or heat pump works, than learn about phase change and latent heat before you read more. You just won't get it. However....load calculations on a skyscraper or airframe can be applied to planet bodies , but that is for any one who cares to write me. or even read this....is there anyone,...Out there? (the Wall)\n\nSo the good news is our planet  will not just burn up or have run away heat rise. The bad news is, it will oscilate from heat events to cold events very quickly. As heat  lifts water up in routinely great amounts, it means the same great amount of water will come down producing big cold events not just in winter but in the summer too. As global warming goes on this will be every year, all the time, year after year season after season. No longer will ideas like \"storm of 100 or 1000 years have any meaning. Those that look to record cold snowy events as evidence there is no global warming don‚Äôt know they are looking in fact at evidence of global warming. \n\nAnd  speaking of things people look at and don‚Äôt see, let‚Äôs talk about a more insulated atmosphere. A more insulative atmosphere is like putting a thicker blanket all around the earth. This means that the earth's core cannot radiate it‚Äôs heat as fast as it used to and heat is retained inside the earth. This retained heat will melt ever increasing amounts of rock. This melted rock will rise up to the surface as increased volcanic and earthquake activity. It is like a giant thunder cloud of molten rock rising up to the surface to give off the heat from the core to our surface, the one  we stand on. Maybe the international climate change model should include this in its new heat pump cooling model?

Dating with ice cores we can only find that increase over the course of millennia. Global temperatures had also taken a hundred thousand years to gradually increase/decrease by point percentages. But not today... we go through that in less than a decade. \n\nA 2c rise in global temperature is NOT a scare tactic it is in fact a tipping point that will melt glaciers within years. And like that cube of ice in your glass melts from room temperature, when it‚Äôs gone the temperature of the liquid will also rise exponentially to room temperature.

I really can't understand how a highly educated person like you can say i will not wait for the planet to melt, are you expecting some kind of Hollywood apocalypse and that not using plastic will help to prevent that? If you really cared about the planet, you would be against all of the fear mongering and would support that the trillions that are invested in the solar and wind energy research and for the support of its science would be redirected to helping the people in countries tha have a lack of power supply or clean water, millions die yearly because of the lack of this basic needs, to me children dying from malnutrition, dehydration or polluted water is a greater concern than supposed warming of the planet, which according to the same scientists was supposed to end in similar catastrophic events already twice in the past and freeze over, so far none of it happened. So yes i question this on the basis of no consensus from the science, but rather politics and media, and also i take in consideration that the weather that my grandparents grew up in is the same as i am experiencing now, the summers had the same temperatures and heat waves, also scares of Doom looming over them and then winters some had freezing temperatures and snow some were mild and no snow and then back to snow, needless to say no mass extinction happened or any for that matter and life continues as normal, the only difference is that there is more stuff that storms can destroy than before.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "igor vreƒçar", "channel": "UC0YRcSV0Z2yg-1Cz43ywN4Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSko5pdU_xhg3FvWssiYsE9y0a3QQBhdR56ygRe2A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzhNZCLXmXBJwUzktB4AaABAg", "text": "The world has been getting warmer and warmer ever since the last Ice Age ended only fifteen thousand years ago. That flood at the end of the last Ice Age is even recorded in the Bible as the Flood of Noah. The Ice Age began approximately 75,000 years ago when the Super Volcano in Sumatra called Mount Toba erupted sending the world into a full Ice Age. During such full Ice Ages sea level globally goes down three to four kilometers lower than it is today. Thus sending every continent in the world to an altitude well above the snow line. All the glaciers in the world date from that time 75,000 years ago. The world spends 95% of its geological history in the full Ice Age mode. The \"warm inter glacial\" world as we see it today is going to end very abruptly just as soon as a Super Volcano some where in the world erupts again. Instead of worrying about \"man made global warming\" we aught instead to prepare for the inevitable catastrophic super volcano eruption. The return to full Ice Age is well over due. The glaciers will return, but we will not be alive to see it. A super volcano erupting any where on the planet is the end of our civilisation. Any survivors will be immediately thrown back into the stone age. In fact will any one any where be able to survive such a cataclysmic event ? http://www.cdbaby.com/artist/neillove\n\n\n.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "DEEPBLUESKY", "channel": "UC47_6iT557oKH1fjQ3k91cg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/1LfFnD8jLOgFhw949QMI4OWmvOoNndhVbSe4g6kyxNw5N8ju_BtXdyV8H3goVaGwICRPTPG-yKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Climate change doesn't work in 1 direction, even if humans somehow warmed the planet 10C, it is almost certain our planet would once again cool down, and sea levels would drop (especially considering 60-80% of the CO2 in the atmosphere only stays there for 20-200 years).

Also, most animal sea life (~90%) already lives near the coast, and that's not even a bad thing.\n\n\n3. \"Christmas will never be as cold as it was\"\n\n\n- Never is a bold statement, and not supported by data. Simply because the climate may warm now, doesn't mean it may not cool in the near or distant future.
