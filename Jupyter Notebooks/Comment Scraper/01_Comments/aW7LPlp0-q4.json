Depending on how old you are, you'll see how it plays out in your lifetime.  Regardless, there's no hope.  The world is too profit driven and divided to come together, but even if they did, it's too late.  The climate will continue to warm, and it will continue to worsen.\n\nBy the way, you don't even have to believe in man made climate change.  Just that the climate is changing and getting warmer, which should be obvious to you.  You also know the planet always goes into ice age/warming cycles.  What makes you think the warming is just going to stop here, where it is now?  No, it's going to get worse and worse over the coming decades.\n\nAlso, I don't have an agenda by saying this.  My belief is it's too late.  I'd like to see mitigation efforts, but it's hopeless when you realize where the emissions are coming from and why.  It's too late, and catastrophe in the coming decades is inevitable.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "radjedi2010", "channel": "UCrHf4anBG26l8E89PYu6biQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT9WTB5cfOEUqixgNropSSBl4WGaw0qQ7-eDw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgyhpK-qDc_rfd0E8th4AaABAg.9D0YMSLm3Fs9D7Jb5zO8Z9", "text": " @Jenn smith  Exactly.  You're exactly right.  It HAS happened before on this planet.  And guess what?  Conditions were by and large not as habitable to humans when it did happen.  Remember, humans have only been around for ~200,000 years, whereas the glacial/interglacial cycles have occurred over the span of hundreds of millions of years.   Humans have evolved in the lifestyle we're accustomed to precisely because the climate has been relatively stable in the short time humans have existed.  \n\nYou also don't seem to grasp what would happen with climate change.  It leads to overall a warmer climate, yes, but worsened extremes as well.  Countries with millions upon millions of people live near and on the equator would become extremely inhospitable, and in many ways deadly, to humans.\n\nI'd encourage you to read about it.  Both sides.  I spent a lot of time reading climate deniers' websites, arguments, and videos.  Why?  Because I wanted to believe them.  I wanted to get comfort.  But deniers' arguments are all based on half suppositions, taking papers out of context, distorting facts- similar to when you read flat earthers' arguments.  Anyone with a little amount of time and effort could systematically dismantle most of the climate deniers' arguments easily.  Sometimes it takes a little research to figure out the con game the more sophisticated deniers do.\n\nIf you're young, disaster may or may not occur by the end of your lifetime.  But your kids, and definitely their kids, are in for a freaking doozy of a time.  Don't worry though, it's by and large too late and definitely out of the control of anyone like you or me.  Just keep planting your corn and burying your head in the sand.

If it were then there would be a decrease in entropy and so we can deduce that the radiative forcing greenhouse conjecture is false.\r\n\r\nI subsequently proved the first paper on PSI about the “Model Atmosphere” to be riddled with errors in its attempt to claim that all we needed was solar radiation to the surface in order to explain observed temperatures. It is so easy to understand why that is not the case because the Moon’s surface receives about twice as much solar radiation and does not simultaneously lose energy also by evaporation, conduction and convection as does Earth’s surface. The average temperature of the Moon’s surface is below zero Celsius and Earth’s global mean surface temperature would be less than 233K if solar radiation to the surface were the only reason.\r\n\r\nSo that leaves the world with no valid explanation for the global mean surface temperature of planets like Earth and Venus.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, after considerable research and thought, I explained what does happen on all planets and moons with atmospheres in my paper “Planetary Core and Surface Temperatures” on which was based my book published in 2014. It will probably take another decade or so before the truth in that paper is widely known and recognised.\r\n\r\nThe claim of AGW proponents that there would be an isothermal troposphere in the absence of “greenhouse” gases contravenes the Second Law of Thermodynamics as it would not be the state of maximum entropy, having more gravitational potential energy per molecule at higher altitudes and yet the same mean molecular kinetic energy and thus unbalanced energy potentials. Thermodynamic equilibrium is reached when there are no remaining unbalanced energy potentials and so the sum of (KE + PE) is homogeneous over altitude. Thus, since PE varies, so does KE, that is the temperature becomes warmer at the base of the troposphere (where PE is least) without any back radiation needed. All surface temperatures on all planets can be correctly explained based on this, so if back radiation could do extra surface warming then we would all cook.\r\n\r\nNow that I have liquid funds in six figures I will by late next year be funding the establishment of a major class action by Australian companies affected financially by the hoax against the CSIRO and national and state governments, using responses to numerous Freedom of Information requests and being the main witness, as I can easily prove climatology claims false.\n\n\nhttp://whyitsnotco2.com", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Doug Acclaim Software", "channel": "UCUNPpKTRxBNY2U_n1Mnbljg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR7XWn1vpeGZtssqys4XHDBfJHSKRdi_36IHYmE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We will not be around forever unless we work in complete harmony with the planet that we are destroying, we are not going to move off this rock and become an interplanetary society with little knowledge of universal cosmic natural law, responsibility that we are not letting the majority of us in on the secret of what its going to require the aggregate of society. ALL of us must learn the monetary system is the bait, until we realize everything could be free and stop the Hegelian dialectic of mass control and competing for resources or we will not be truly free. Voting only works with a well educated population.  Lets rethink the democratic system without creating any class welfare warfare. All politics is mind control, teach the occult sciences in all schools.  Government as we know it now is slavery.  Stop watching the puppet talking heads and giving them any attention at all, its only energizing them to continue leading sheep off the cliffs.  We have so much ability that we have not even begun to uncover our potential as the amazing beings that we have the ability to become with endless distractions to cloud our mind and time.  This is all a game and as soon we figure out how to properly play it we should even step up to the chess board, cause the master physiologists are waiting for a worthy opponent.  Sure vote......wont change the hearts and minds of men.  So in short yeah no where near sufficient of hitting any target of mine. What were we talking about again, oh yeah climate. Go back to sleep it will all be OK.  Free moneys coming for all who elect to be ruled....free padded walled 5 star hotel rooms and all drugs for everyone forever any and all entertainment included.

It never worked, because while former presidents took their money they also allowed the agrobusiness to ransack southern and eastern Amazon, and turn most of it into cow pastures, bringing white brazilians to colonize the land in replacement of the traditional, indigenous people. So, Norway and Germany closed the fund, after wasting millions of euros, which, truth be told, helped to organize and fund some federal agencies who fight the mispratices  agrobusiness, but it's. Not.

Let's go through the clip.\nThe moderator asks Bernie for specific meassures in his policy to fight climate change.\nBernie responds to that by saying that we have to fight climate change and the situation is serious. The concrete meassures he suggests are to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry. He then asks for Biden's position.\nBiden does in fact bring up Obama, fair enough. Then he talks about how serious he takes the issue, yadda yadda. Then at 2:50 Biden starts listin stuff he wants to do. It's quite a few suggestions. He finishes that at around 4:35.\nBernie responds brilliantly: \"All well and good, but nowhere near enough\". Bernie then talks about how we have to act boldly, and how we have to have courage. He says we have to \"take on\" the healthcare industry and the fossil fuel industry. But he doesn't present any actual policy. Wow, great reply Bernie.\nThen Biden responds by listing more policies he wants to enact.\nThen, at around 7:00, Bernie says it's not enough. He does suggest we should stop fracking, which I suppose is a policy. Then Biden responds with how he takes it seriously too. Now we´re at 8:49. Bernie once again states how serious the situation is, and lists no policy. Biden responds by listing stuff he has done in the past, and about building high speed rail, to reduce automotive traffic. Then the clip ends.\n\nBernie sucked in this clip.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "B An", "channel": "UC72nfx2r682UA4qw7Dcqecg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT5DX-UV5WVMIi5kGPWtyWjqmM9m4H2Pfgn3g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The network is disconnected for two seconds per second, the network is often disconnected, opening and closing of positions is prohibited, interest rates are adjusted significantly, and leverage is significantly reduced.  This is a zero and ring money market with no bottom line!  After the advent of the Internet era, a large number of tragedies in the foreign exchange market have appeared!  The official statistics of the number of people who make money is wrong. Almost 100% of the money comes out after entering. Making money is just a short-term fluke!  What Swiss francs break out of the bundle, Brexit, non-agricultural data, are all reasons for the black forces to make money!  What news and value are under the control of the black forces!  Black forces hinder the flow of funds in the right direction!  Black forces control all currency pairs!  Without admitting failure, they have no bottom line!  This is not an investment and value analysis market at all.  Buying the highest or lowest point can make you lose money, such as oil that arbitrarily reduces profits to confiscate funds!  They can be divided into varieties, time periods, and batches, and targeted to step by step to kill their target!

Age shouldn't matter in a Election. Nor should one's gender or sexual orientation, race, religion, none of that should matter. What matters is a candidate who's polices and ideas bring about positive changes. Someone who remains consistent and won't deviate from going forth to achieve and instate those polices for the people. That is leadership. We as voters have to decide on who's polices resonate with us and for the betterment of the Country as well as if that candidate will fight for those policies. Anybody can say this or that but you need a track record and history of fighting for those polices your pushing. If you don't have that how can you be expected to be taken seriously in the people's eyes? Again it's because of those very reason's people are taking him seriously.\n\n\nLook at how the entire DNC and Democratic runners have turned to square against him. You turned to bring down your front-runner after winning Iowa, large win in New Hampshire, and then another large win in Nevada. The reason being is they have Corporate interest and don't really care about the American people. Like really Joe Biden placed 2nd in Nevada, placed 4th in New Hampshire, and again 4th in Iowa. By statistics Pete was the stronger candidate to go against Bernie after the early state primaries. But that didn't happen instead he dropped out to support Joe Biden as did Amy and eventually Yang. They were clearly all promised something in return if Job Biden were to win. The other factor is Media News has set a negative narrative on why Bernie isn't electable when compared to Joe Biden. Joe Biden didn't have any momentum moving forward yet somehow is now the front runner. Really what are the reasons for that? Yet listen to the pair of them. Who has the better track record, better policies, the youth vote and independent voters you'll need to defeat Trump, all those things that'll be needed to win in the Presidential Election. It's the older demographic that is falling prey to the Media New's narratives on why Bernie Sander's isn't electable or the candidate to defeat Donald Trump which just isn't true. You have a situation where this older demographic is supporting a candidate who has advocated for cutting all Social Programs where as with the other he wants to expand it and cover everyone. These are programs that demographic is more heavily dependent upon vs other aged demographics. They simply aren't fact checking and believing what the Media has to say and 30-40+ years ago before the Internet or other means of Media this would've been true. The issue now is Media News gets to present things before nearly everyone else on a massive scale. By doing so they can easily tweak or bend the truth or lies to their liking.

Yes Bernie supported some of his ideas like Automation Tax a great policy one I would love to see implemented. The problem is UBI (Universal Basic Income) doesn't fix the Insurance, Medical, Student Loans, or Pharmaceutical issues that are present within this Country. It's why they clashed and banged heads on their ideas. Now yes people will have that $1000 of extra income each month but how long until Insurance, Medical, Pharmaceuticals, or Student Loans increase eliminating the benefits of that extra income? It's the same story over and over these wealthy elites are not satisfied nor will ever be satisfied. Look at how we've thrown 1.7 Trillion into Wallstreet in a attempt to halt the Market from crashing. Didn't even hesitate on that matter and all it did was grant and hour before plummeting again. And now were looking at another 700 Billion beyond the already 1.7 Trillion. Combined your looking at more than what we spent upfront in the Iran War before interest kicks in (some 7 Trillion when all said and done). \n\n\nWhat Bernie has been advocating for decades is to stop spending on wars, military funding (we're now over 800 billion a year in funding), stop handing out subsidies to the gas/oil companies costing us $20 billion a year, eliminate Insurance Companies profiteering which is killing people, place every American citizen under a Single Payer Insurance plan that protects everyone saving 100's of millions of people money and saving the U.S Government 450 billion dollars a year if not more which would be several Trillion over the span of 10 years as well as saving lives which our current system doesn't do because everyone isn't covered nor do these Companies cover everything, lower prescription drug cost to affordable levels, the list goes on and on. When you stop and look at everything he is fighting and advocating for he deeply cares for the American people of this Country. Look at how many people within the Democratic Primary were running on Progressive ideas some very similar to Bernie's. You didn't have that 20 years ago. His actions of addressing these dire issues is getting people discussing them and they need to be. \n\n\nAnd again if you think he doesn't care he has gotten people affordable prescription drugs by taking people to Canada to purchase them for substantially less. People who were rationing or didn't have any insulin who'd likely of died or been admitted to the Hospital if they didn't get it. He as of last year talked a man out of killing himself at one of his Rallies. The list of what he has done to try to help people goes on & on. He doesn't change on his policies or beliefs and remains consistent. Even after suffering a minor heart attack having to have stints put in he had returned to campaign and is still fighting for Presidency. If he didn't care he could've just thrown in the towel then and there and said I don't feel healthy enough or well enough to carry on. Nobody would've faulted him for that. Yet he is still fighting. If these are the signs of a corrupt man who cares more about his image than facts or actually helping people with real world changing ideas that aren't even new at that I don't know what is. He's given numerous facts time and time again on many of his policies that other Nations and Countries around the world has successfully been using for Decades with success.

The USA has had two commercial LWBR with Thorium Cores at Ft Vrain and Shippingport which present many of the same meltdown risks as conventional reactors. \n\n2. The USA and UK tested nuclear weapons from Uranium 233 in the 1950-1960s and India replicated the process and tests in the 1980s.\n\nUranium 233 is the fissile fuel made from Thorium 232 through a process called breeding. \n\nBreeding: \n\nTh-232 + 1n -> Th-233 (decay) -> Pa-233 (decay) -> U-233\n\nWhat Yang is likely referring to is a very specific reactor that is not called a thorium reactor. It’s called a LFTR, which stands for Liquid Flouride Thorium Reactor. This reactor belongs to the MSR or Molten Salt Reactor family. \n\nThe difference between a LFTR and a BWR or PWR is not that it uses Thorium. The massive differences are: \n\n1. LFTRs do not use water coolant - they use fluoride compounds \n\n- LFTR coolants have much much higher boiling and freezing points than water. \n\n- LFTR fuel is dissolved in its coolant and run as a liquid\n\n2. LFTRs do not use solid fuel\n\n3. LFTRs do not use fuel rods\n\n4. LFTRs operate at much higher temperatures \n\n5. LFTRs do not operate in high pressure (except for specific sections of the reactor core)\n\nWhat Yang is primarily talking about from a safety standpoint has far more to do with the coolant used in a reactor and the operational procedures of the reactor than using Thorium.\n\nFor example other MSRs have similar safety risks as LFTRs, but don’t use Thorium such as IMSR, MCFR, MSFR, MSAHTR.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Brian", "channel": "UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTiYkDaEun9HQFB5pzLUGT4alprwEXKHPe8nw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Honestly the biggest thing right off the bat - it has zero data of any kind for infrastructure. \n\nThat is absurd. \n\nThis is an extremely technical industry that requires someone to have some understanding of the scale of systems used in this country. To just say we are going to throw $1.5 trillion at the problem and complete it in 10 years without any information describing capacity additions, VRE concentration, loading system, grid adjustments, storage capacity - it comes off as incredibly sketchy. \n\nEspecially when you consider the fact that $1.5 trillion over 10 years is CRAZY LOW for infrastructure spending in the USA compared to pretty much every engineering analysis report.\n\nI mean how do you even calculate the cost of infrastructure without knowing the quantity or type that’s going to be built? \n\nAdditionally I have major issues where he is planning for federal agencies to gain control of system that they are fundamentally not designed nor have ever managed in their history. \n\nSo in the Sanders GND he states that PMA- Power Marketing Administration will own and manage all renewable generation under the GND. \n\nThis is incredibly bizzare. PMAs were created in the early 1900s in the USA to sell power to farming communities near federal dams that would generate excess electricty when water was released in irrigation seasons. The electricty was sold at the lowest market price so as to not create increased economic turmoil for lower income communities (This is important and ill get back to it). Later in the 1930s  the markets for sold power were extended to all nearby utilities of federal dams so as to provide below market energy and ramp up the growth and profit for the electrical industry in the New Deal. \n\nHow do PMAs sell electricity at the lowest market or below market energy prices? Because they receive zero interest loans from the US treasury. Now why does the US treasury do this? Because the assets receiving the loans have consistent high supply, high operating capacity and high consistent production, therefore posing low risk for beneficial investment. \n\nThe three characteristics above exist ONLY for hydroelectric. They do not exist for solar nor wind, which is in part why PMAs have never owned nor managed solar and wind. \n\nYet under Sanders GND not only will they suddenly somehow start selling this energy - they have the sole ownership of all solar and wind production. \n\nI have no idea how Sanders thinks this is a good idea... Why on earth give sole ownership of likely the majority share of energy generation to a federal entity with zero experience managing it, instead of allowing public and private utilities that currently manage it to continue to do so at an increased rate of production?", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Brian", "channel": "UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTiYkDaEun9HQFB5pzLUGT4alprwEXKHPe8nw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And the IPCC report literally calls for an increase in nuclear and CCS technologies through 2050.

Not all PMAs own transmission. SEPA for example does not own, build or manage any transmission lines. \n\n2. PMAs solely own federal hydroelectric dams. They are not designed or have any experience owning and managing solar and wind farms or storage facilities other than hydro. \n\n3. There already exists a wholesale electricity market for the remaining 17 states that are currently not covered by a PMA. This market is operated by MISO, NYISO, OEISO, NBISO and PJM Interconnection. These are Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) that in addition to managing this market manage the Eastern Interconnection as part of the North American Electrical Grid. RTOs and ISOs report to FERC - that’s the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, who is literally never talked about in his entire GND.

Absolutely not. \n\nI certainly care, and even though I know a lot more than a lot of people I would not say I’m an expert. \n\nThis is why in my last comment I’ve given you 46 sources from published studies on the subject.

However if we want to truly solve this thing we need the plan to be based around science and engineering not whatever platitude is going to get a candidate elected.\n\n** I have additional sources of information or if you are interested in a particular topic I may have something to provide you with. If not I’d recommend looking the subject on Google Scholar, Research Gate or Science Direct Mediums. Most of the sources I’ve provided do not have paywalls but you may run into this problem with some sources you find. \n\nI’d also heavily advocate that you watch seminars from US National Labs as they provide extremely good information on these topics in many cases a laymen’s explanation or educational setting. Additionally US National Labs have the technology to run reports at scale whereas other institutions don’t exactly have the ability to run the efficiency losses for the entire power grid that spans 700,000 miles. \n\nI’d very very very strongly recommend Watching videos from ANL, PNNL, NREL, LNL, and BNL and have left a seminar video below talking about the US Electrical Grid: \n\n-“Argonne OutLoud: Ensuring a Resilient Power Grid”\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ-57hrPovc", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Brian", "channel": "UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTiYkDaEun9HQFB5pzLUGT4alprwEXKHPe8nw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Media News is setting the Narrative on making it seem Joe Biden is more Electable and he isn't. Look at Bernie was in a Media Blackout early on through the Democratic Primaries. He wasn't hardly shown or spoken about even though he was consistently polling 2nd or 3rd place until he won Iowa & New Hampshire. Even after that the coverage he got was directed negatively at him. Such as well his percentages were significantly less than during 2016. Well of course they were. Look at how many more people were running in 2020 as opposed to 2106. When you have more people pushing different policies it divides those votes up. So if anything he did a much better job as opposed to 2016 as a result. Or you could look at them saying look at his narrow lead. If you take so & so's percentages he's trailing behind. So his lead really isn't that much. It's whatever Media News can use or spin negatively to set the narrative and people are believing it. \n\n\nWhat has to happen is we need a strong Media presence that'll do fact checking with absolute accuracy. A group of moderators who'll challenge and fact check what's being said and present those findings to the American people. We need a presence that'll hold people accountable and in check. Like during the debates we should have moderators fact checking. Any one of the moderators during this Debate could've fact checked Joe Biden on advocating about cutting all Social Programs and not just Social Security. \n\n\nAll I'm saying is don't expect Media News to cover this or reveal Job Biden's pathological lies. These are Corporate entities who's higher ups wish to protect their investments and wealth. The only way they'll cover it is if we the American people/viewers demand it of them which we shouldn't have to do. We all have to unfortunately be the ones to bring this out into the open and get it viral attention that can't be ignored or covered up. We have to start spreading the word to people, sharing the evidence and clips all over social media, really get involved. Because if we don't they are going to get away with this just as they always have which is unacceptable.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Viktor Bryce", "channel": "UC0XkfjQq09VvH2i7ncmyK0Q", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRxpJNeieVkotN1AIWuyqBgYJT0yhz6R2vUCbs=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As you mentioned the initial thrust would be one of the main issues.  Perhaps fuel for thrust switching to electric for flight would be more reasonable.  From the first article it seems that large commercial flights are likely 20 years away.   'Looking at this more realistically, a true electric passenger flight taking a plane-full of passengers from New York to London is 20 years off. And that’s being generous.'  However the other article states that smaller flights might only be a few years away.  'It is possible for small aircraft to be powered by electricity. In fact several companies are already developing small electric aircraft and they could come on the market within the next few years.'

I have a decent paying job, raised my son on my own and have had a lot of hard-working construction type jobs in my younger years.   I think that you're the one living in a fairy tale land where things apparently never change.  You want to read the same story OVER and OVER and OVER again.  Some changes suck and are hard to deal with and some better society as a whole.  NOT trusting the government I understand but the current state of the country is not sustainable and something needs to change!  Some people thought Trump would change it.  I think he made it worse.  The status quo certainly isn't working.  Look back to when the country was doing well, people could afford housing, could pay off student debt, weren't drowning in medical bills.  What type of government existed then?  It was a government that was still divided but had some decorum and actually worked TOGETHER to solve problems.  The rich were certainly taxed at a higher percentage than they are now and the economic inequality was nowhere near what it is now.  All this information is easily searchable online. \n\n\n\nToday there is far too much corruption and greed in politics ON BOTH SIDES and in the corporate world.  Money doesn't make the world go round ... PEOPLE DO!   Countries need to invest in their people and, in turn, will have a much happier and productive society.  A few of the wealthy are just starting to figure this out now and some companies are as well.  But the majority are just greedy pricks allowing the ones at the top and the shareholders to reap the benefits while the remainder are basically just slave labor.   With unfortunately not many places to go due to unemployment and the all too common previously mentioned greed aspect.  Do you not realize that those in power WANT us divided?  If we're fighting amongst ourselves we won't band together and DEMAND that they do their job properly.

People just go with what is advertised as it's what they know is normal. Biden vs Bernie also has a good ring to it so media will use that more than the others.\n\n\n\nGoing with Bernie and not Sanders is a good choice from a campaign perspective as it's friendlier as it's a first name, friendly is what you want for a more left wing campaign. It also sounds more punchy as it starts with a hard consonant. Sanders is pretty common surname and most importantly has no hard consonants so it's not punchy at all. I imagine they didn't choose Joe for a similar reason, although it may have been a clever move to play into the whole working Joe shtick. There's no enforced rules on which name you market so this will always happen. \n\n\n\nLook at Barrack Obama, that's a punchy name that's fun to say, same with Donald Trump, George Bush, it's small things that change people's view at the first impression.

You dont just tell 100 million people they have to kiss goodbye to their own insurance whether they want to or not. Paying off student loans is going to anger many people (myself included) who busted their asses for years - some even decades - paying off their student loans. Some of these bernie ideas are not going to get dissapointed trump voters to jump ship to the dem side. And shame on any bernie supporter saying they wont vote in the general or even vote trump if bernie isnt the nominee (like you did in 2016 and helped us get president trump). You are helping give trump 4 more years, and you wont be able to recognize this nation if that happens. Nothing done on climate change, nothing done about guns, no improvement to healthcare, and a womans rite to chose will be under assault, just to name a few, as he will get AT LEAST 2 more supreme court nominees.

Trillions of your tax dollars that go to military contractors & not actually to the men & women serving. Now tell me again how you can't afford to help the tax payer with less costly social programs? I dare you to argue these truths that you the tax payer socialize for the rich! Bernie Is the answer!\r\nThe racist corrupt republicans will win again, the corrupt democrat leaders would rather back a corrupt corporate center candidate than an honest progressive. They will even throw the election to the republicans just so corrupt Pelosi keeps the corporate dark money flowing into bank accounts. The republicans will always have their ace in the hole, hate, fear & racism. That is always their winning strategy.\r\nThe wholesale purchase of the politicians started under the republican corruption allowed by Reagan, yes saint Ronny the first bumbling fool. Then H.W. Bush let the republican corruption continue. Then we got Clinton, who saw that the democrats were dying to get their hands on some of that big money so he allowed the congress & senate to finish us off.\r\nIt just kept getting worse until we now have the most corrupt (not the only) criminal running the country like a brothel. Just come on in & buy a political whore, democrat or republican, it doesn't matter anymore. But the stupid racist republicans & stupid democrats keep voting for the same corruption.\r\nWhat Trump & his mob family have proven is that the republicans are a gang of racist thieves bent on stealing every tax dollar for themselves & their benefactors.

Biden doesn't even tackle such immediate and severe effects, because he will not stop the rich from doing anything. Sanders' policies are across-the-board changes for everyone, especially those whose impacts are great, like corporations and the lifestyles of the ultra-rich with their --yes! toys like submarines (their number one Christmas gift a few years back). Small changes and programs that take effect in 15 years have insignificant impact, especially when the GOP are then back into office and stop them again, as Trump has done.   Bernie is correct-- This is serious and Biden does not \"get it\". Stopping programs that harm the environment (like wars) is every bit as important, if not more important, than programs to pay companies to stop infractions of the laws. BTW, Bernie is known for his consistent and lifelong career toward these goals.Biden is known for his compromises with money that are controversial and will be used by Trump to defeat his election.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Hut Reader", "channel": "UCgYk5Nllin6P98XYFEbO4VA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSpQ54vXFu06cEVAxqPoGhyz2yF_6D1tuoL5Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The reason why I believe Bernie would be a better opponent for trump because then it would be the working class for vs the 1%, im no mathematician but last time I checked 99% is much more than 1%. Biden is just a starving poor mans Obama. We need a strong candidate vs trump, It is honestly beyond me that Biden is ahead of Bernie, Bernie is a man of class. America needs a change, people say his ideas are radical and instead people just go with the safe option, well last time I checked the safe option didn't work in 2016. Take the risk it will benefit you more in the end, And even if you are an older citizen and do not agree with Bernie, think about the future generations for example your kids and grand kids they will be much better off with Bernie. Think about your kid just turning 18 and getting his first job, don't you want him or her to be earning the highest wage possible? Many people in the US don't go to college because it is \"too expensive\" Well guess what 60 y/os with Bernie your grandchild can get a free public college tuition! THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY! And also how does Biden get so much black support?, there are literally videos on the Internet of him wanting to pass a racist bill, but of course the news will not show it because it is controlled by the 1% and they don't want to hurt their chances. My mom has a friend who one time her jaw hurt so much so she went to the ER and guess what, she got a  one single pill to reduce her pain and it cost her 6000 fucking dollars, these big industries like the pharmaceutical industry  are a bunch of jokes, and with Biden almost everything will stay the same! With the same thing, some people will still have to work 3 jobs just to get by, now do you really want to come home at 9 o clock and have your back all messed up and whlle being tired?.

{"cid": "UgzrPmyHRDyLaU4jWht4AaABAg", "text": "Look, people are going to do whatever they want and I'm not expecting to change the world with a YouTube comment.  But just a couple things for now:\n\n(1) To anybody taking it for granted that Joe Biden would beat Trump...sorry, he'd get his CLOCK CLEANED by Trump because too many people (myself included) have finally decided we want someone who actually represents us, instead of their big money donors, and we're not settling for the \"lesser of two evils\" anymore.  But Joe Biden thinks every voter is a baby-boomer or older so he misses this stuff.    \n\n(2) Opinions aside, Joe Biden told at least two egregious lies last night: (a) when he repeatedly denied trying to cut social security, that goes against his decades-long record of, wouldn't you know it, trying to cut social security!!! :)  Here's just one of many on-point clips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF6Sk0aoGpo.  (b) When Joe Biden claimed that the 2005 bankruptcy bill that he spearheaded didn't make private student loans non-dischargeable, that was also a lie.  I frankly don't know what he's even saying, here, but that was EXACTLY what the bill did and there's just nothing else to say about it.  Let me put it this way: this lie is literally so opposite of the truth that it would be like saying the First Amendment didn't create free speech, the Bankruptcy Code didn't create bankruptcy, etc.  This man is just VERY comfortable lying.    \n\nFolks, again, I have no illusions that I'm changing the world, here, but Bernie Sanders is by far the better candidate and the day this country wakes up and gives Progressive policies a chance, the American middle class will rise up again as it did during the FDR years (which, wouldn't you know it, was the last time Progressive policies were mainstream in this country).  But if the public keeps buying the for-profit media hype and enabling bought-and-paid-for corporate hacks like Joe Biden, the fate of the American middle class will continue to get worse indefinitely.

They did not know it would be co2, but the plan they came up with was to come up with some ecological disaster that was so far in the future that we would not see the evidence of it, but if we did not do everything in our power to stop it, it would kill the grand kids. That is precisely what they are claiming that co2 caused warming will do. Now look at what they are trying to do.\n1)  make us stop using fossil fuels now (make it illegal) and force us to drive only electric cars which do not have the capacity to get the majority around meaning we will be dependent on mass transit. This means most of us will have to spend all day getting from and to our jobs or we will have to find jobs close to home, taking any job no matter how bad the pay.\n\n2) They want to make choices of what kind of food we eat. When they declare a climate emergency, everything will be related to climate. They can take over soda companies and then decide its not good for the climate to have so many choices of sodas and reduce the choices so that we do not have to \"waste so much energy moving them around\".\n\n3) They want to decide if you have a/c. IF it isnt life and death, they can decide you can just open your window.\n\nI can go on, but all you have to do is look at their websites and see all the choices you will lose. Every time you lose a choice, you are losing part of your rights.

{"cid": "UgwLSuf2Uu9pm-9Osnt4AaABAg", "text": "As time has passed down through the ages one thing is clear. Mankind is mortal. Death is imminent from the moment of birth or even before birth. It may come inside the womb, one year old 40 years old 90 years old. Nothing will stop it. So whatever success may be achieved it is ultimately doomed to fail. Everything that has been, that is or will be is tumbling towards judgement. We are but wisps of smoke. Here today, gone tomorrow. Great proclamations are made. Great discoveries are unearthed or witnessed in the heavens. But they've always been there. We were created from the earth. And everything we created was already here. In the elements of the earth. We are on a planet moving 63,000 mph through space within a spiraling galaxy moving a million mph through space !!!! The chances of DNA coming together exactly as it does to make us is 1 × 10 to the 24th power. That's beyond comprehension. That's impossible without a Creator. This dimension of time we exist in is winding to a conclusion. It doesn't matter what we believe. What is, is. It's in the air. It's been foretold. And whether or not you believe it doesn't matter. It will happen. It's happening. It's been happening from the beginning. One thousand years, one million years, one billion years is as one day to God. Time has no hold on Him who created it. Flesh is bound by its mortality. Spirit is immortal. Only by faith does the spirit in mankind awaken. Without it we'll remain blind. Trapped in the moment. Leaving the past behind with each passing step or heartbeat and only glimpsing the future before it becomes the present then moves away to the past. Every single success or failure is therefore temporary. The only thing thereby that matters is the faith in the One in control and the hope of His blessed return. Which has always been a certainty.

You want to talk about FREE SHIT, let's talk about the giveaways to the rich who pay almost no taxes and get constant tax breaks, let's talk about corporations like amazon paying 0 taxes, let's talk about subsidies to oil and gas companies, let's talk about tax rates on investments being lower than on regular income earned through hard work, let's talk about socialism for the rich but rugged capitalism for the poor. Get the fuck out of here pretending you care about giving away free shit. Because you sure as shit aren't talking about all the free shit we're giving away to people who need it the least. But god forbid someone working 3 minimum wage jobs gets healthcare that doesn't bankrupt them. Or that our kids can get an education without risking debt for life. But they, if they can't afford it it's OK, we can just bring in all those well educated immigrants to take the jobs that could be done by our kids...or otherwise fall behind.

Taxes on those making over 500k are 37% (or were in 2018) and Trump has certainly not raised them. Taxing the rich and more importantly corporations brings in the money necessary to pay for necessities that help everyone (schools, roads, medicare, etc.). In Canada the average tax rate for those making 500k is 46.67% and the marginal tax rate is 53.53%. And they are far from a failing economy. In fact in a lot of areas they enjoy a higher standard of living, especially the working and middle classes who don't have to risk bankruptcy to get medical care. Also, a quick google search shows that the top marginal tax rate in 1960 was 91%, which applied to income over $200,000 (for single filers) or $400,000 (for married filers) – thresholds which correspond to approximately $1.5 million and $3 million, respectively, in today's dollars. None of what i'm saying even comes close to saying that everyone would be making the same amount. Not even CLOSE. but i love how you keep pulling bullshit out of your ass. In total, the tax burden on people making minimum wage is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than on the top 1%, who basically pay none when you account for the tricks they use (see how Trump used \"loses\" to avoid taxes) and tax dodging practices (like the ones exposed in the Paradise Papers. The rich are the biggest leaches in our current system, by a long shot. It would be great if you stopped spreading bullshit though.

The New Deal programs created jobs and provided financial support for the unemployed, the young, and the elderly, as well as adding safeguards and constraints to the banking industry and monetary system.\n\nMostly enacted during the first term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt between 1933 and 1938, the New Deal was implemented through legislation enacted by Congress and presidential executive orders. The programs addressed what historians call the “3 Rs” of dealing with the depression, Relief, Recovery, and Reform—relief for the poor and jobless, recovery of the economy, and reform of the nation’s financial system to safeguard against future depressions.\n\nThe Great Depression, which lasted from 1929 to 1939, was the largest and most significant economic depression to affect both the United States and all Western countries. The stock market crash on October 29, 1929, is infamously known as Black Tuesday and was the worst stock market decline in the history of the United States. Heavy speculation during the rising economy of the 1920s combined with widespread buying on margin (borrowing a large percentage of the cost of investment) were factors in the crash.

{"cid": "UgxEcThCTDYo3jTvjhB4AaABAg", "text": "Message from Mathew , from the higher realms of light....?we shall address your questions about the mixed signals given by the multitude of sources reporting on the coronavirus. The continuous bombardment of information about this disease is bound to have inconsistencies—outdated or incorrect reports of numbers of positive, negative and inconclusive test results; the same about the numbers of deaths; and fear-laden speculation about what may be ahead.\n\nWith innumerable inner city, in-country and international travelers, a contagious disease naturally follows, thus it was not unexpected that the virus would spread far beyond China. Yet, more damaging to the society than this illness are the fear being generated about it and the finger-pointing at Chinese people wherever they are living.\n\nYes, it can be said that fear is “amplified by extreme measures” such as canceling major and local events and airline flights, closing schools, mass quarantining, and testing everyone who may have been exposed to individuals who later are diagnosed with the virus. Those precautions are sensible to curtail the spread of the disease to the extent possible and should allay anxiety, not add to it.\n\nIt is helpful that healthcare professionals are emphasizing there is no reason for panic. They explain the simple measures that help prevent getting the disease, whose symptoms are generally mild; that people who have health issues are the most susceptible; and compared to the numbers that have contracted the virus, the number of deaths is very low.\n\nBy no means are we downplaying, much less overlooking, the abundant emotions involved by asking this: Where is similar concern about the many, many thousands of deaths every day due to starvation, warring, domestic and random violence, vehicle crashes, suicide or chronic diseases due to substandard living conditions?\n\nFrom our vantage point, it appears that the coronavirus’s disruptions of scheduled activities, travel, local and international commerce, and stock markets may be considered by the populace as significant as health concerns.\n\nAnd yes, what we stated in last month’s message holds true: The coronavirus and all attendant publicity will fizzle out, and, like all other activities devised by the dark ones, diseases they design and let loose will come to an end.\n\nOften we have urged you to send love-light to the dark ones because of all members of our universal family, they are most desperately in need of it. They cause terrible conditions worldwide because they are devoid of that energy except for the spark that is their life force.\n\nSome of you have asked if there is a way to send only the light aspect of love-light to individuals who do abhorrent things. No, dear ones, there isn’t—love and light cannot be divided into two compartments. While you could say that light is the makeup of the soul and love is a capacity of the soul, those cannot be separated any more than the soul can be separated from God and Creator.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Drago Kulic", "channel": "UCxrkoCr4ELGwg0f5ML_WNPQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSWe6_ZFnzKrVS8Q7K9UF6L1-YLrWyj70Gct2CaEQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzxgkBK_XG7AMLeU0N4AaABAg", "text": "AAM: On the Coronavirus - What is the truth about the coronavirus? Archangel Michael answers….\n\nArchangel Michael in a personal reading with Steve Beckow through Linda Dillon, Feb. 20, 2020.\nby Steve Beckow\nhttps://goldenageofgaia.com/2020/02/28/306838/\nSteve: What is the true story of the breakout of the coronavirus?\nArchangel Michael: It is not simply one story and this is part of the difficulty that those who are engaged – and there are several, shall we say, interested parties – who like to offer rather simplistic explanations around this or any other, what you can think of, as a virus.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to realize, whether it is natural occurring (which is a curious remark, is it not?) or shall we say, laboratory created, that any virus that in fact becomes alive (because there are many that are simply dormant) is related to the infection or the poison of emotions and belief systems. That is what infects people and that is what kills people.\n\nNow, the human race is not prepared obviously, especially in their panic, to be able to comprehend this because they look to their science for all answers rather than looking for the root cause and addressing it from that.\n\nSo the true story: The coronavirus was created in a laboratory. It was a weaponized virus and it has been let loose by those who have been (not intentionally, by the way, let loose) but by irresponsible handling of the toxin.\n\nSteve: … In Wuhan China?\n\nAAM: Correct\n\nSteve: Did they steal that from a Canadian lab?\n\nAAM: No.\n\nSteve: Did the United States play role?\n\nAAM: No, it is not about the United States although they will be adversely affected as well because as you well know, there are many belief systems in this side of the globe that also need clarification.\n\nSteve: Is Bill Gates implicated in any way?\n\nAAM: He has nothing to do with this.\n\nSteve: Because he has a patent on the coronavirus.\n\nAAM: He has nothing to do with they irresponsible release of the coronavirus.\n\nSteve: Yes, but he does have a vaccine…\n\nAAM: It is not a vaccine that is fully effective or ready.\n\nSteve: There was an exercise having to do with the coronavirus outbreak weeks before it happened. That’s very suspicious.\n\nAAM: Do not look for back stories that may or may not be accurate, Sweet One.\n\nSteve: OK. Will this have a tremendously adverse effect on China?\n\nAAM: No. In fact, in the long run, it will not. Now, is it creating a difficult situation? Most certainly. But what it is also doing, it is actually doing two things in the bigger sense of outcome.\n\nOne, it is demonstrating the dictatorial nature of their culture, of their ability to restrain, contain, etc. And, so, it is bringing to the forefront again, collective and lineage memories of autocracy. So that is the first thing.\n\nBut the second thing is it is also creating and reinforcing within the collective, their own ability to rise to the situation that is extraordinarily dangerous and difficult.\n\nSo, on the one hand, it is showing them that they are in a political regime that is perhaps too controlling but on the other hand it is also raising what you can think of the sense of collective and individual sufficiency and ability to act in a very positive way.\n\n\nVIDEO LINK TO PIXIE SPEAKING OF IT - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC4FQRHFOVo&feature=emb_logo\n\n\nThe virus is still mutating and evolving both spiritually and biologically.\nMutations do not hold power over organic structures that harmonize with Source Frequency.\nThere are 3 coded seed points of origin for the virus that are important to understand for manifesting the antidote.\nThe first two are black box programs that had other intentions.\nThe first seed point intention was as biological warfare to be used as insurance policy in battlegrounds, not for civilian use.\nBelieving that service-to-self factions have the power and ability to unleash biological warfare on Humanity creates extreme dis-empowerment, and activates the victim/savior template through fear.\nThe second seed point intention was hybridization experimentation with biological life forms, such as gene splicing and cloning. It used animal and plant DNA, not Human.\nThe creation was god-complex related as well as to genetic testing.\nThe third seed that resulted in the mutation was of natural means. Not black box, but still dis-harmonious. It was around the exploitation and disregard of and cruelty towards animal life forms.\nThe three seed points came together over a period of time and through a series of events to create a distorted, mutated virus at the cellular level within a certain faction of the captive animal kingdom.\nIt then spread to the wild animal kingdom through deliberate means.\nIt then migrated into the Human kingdom becoming a virulent strain as it once again mutated.\nIt was accidental in it’s version as Coronavirus.\nThere have been other ‘Coronaviruses’, but none like this one, yet it bears the same name.\nSaying it was deliberate is partly but not completely true.\nSaying it was naturally occurring is also partly but not completely true.\nFighting about it brings about the black box program to divide Humanity.\nIndividuals allows themselves to be hijacked by taking a polarity stance.\nHumanity at large is targeted when it comes to the creation of division within, however it is the individuals themselves who allow themselves to be hijacked this way when they take a polarity stance.\nThe Antidote is to hold balance and a disposition that is pragmatic, objective, alert, aware, open, accepting, logical, intuitive and non-judgmental within the higher thought processes. It’s making judgments with integrity within 3rd dimensional reality.\nThe virus has been hijacked to create fear, panic and chaos in order to prevent carbon to crystalline transformation within Humanity, cosmic memory recall and thus, Ascension.\nHumanity at large has been targeted for this. However, it is of the utmost import for you to be fully aware of and know that the hijacking can target the carbon aspect only.\nThe crystalline aspect cannot be hijacked and your knowing of this IS your antidote.\nThe crystalline code shields and shelters the carbon aspect, making you immune.\nThe chemical antidote vaccine is a major black box program false antidote containing DNA scrambling codices to prevent crystalline transformation and ascension.\nThis vaccine is a false antidote.\nCritical mass for the ascension timeline has been reached by humanity, and all black box programs are backfiring and mutating themselves from dark intention into light as manifestation.\nThe antidote in it’s entirety is a lifestyle, a mindset and a spiritual path that must be undertaken by you, the spiritual warrior.\nYou create the antidote together, at the collective level, as One. You shield those that are unable to add their consciousness to this antidote.\nThe vaccine is the false immunity. Your collective power of light is the true immunity. Your knowing of this at the deepest intrinsic levels gives you the immunity and thus you build your architectural, energetic shield.\nBy the time the virus reaches humanity at large it is no longer any threat to the healthy individual with strong immune system in place.\nRegarding 5G ~ The electro-magnetic aspect of the human organism is scrambled or miscoded, creating an immune compromised human organism through close proximity to original 5G testing areas.\nThe 5G created grid is a false bandwidth and wavelength.\nIt’s partly but not entirely true that the coronavirus is 5G poisoning. Original 5G scrambles the DNA code, and the human biofield connects to the false energetic signalling. This took place around the same time as the mutated virus migrated over to the human kingdom, yet was a different and separate black box program that was subsequently hijacked and linked together. As we have said, this situation is a convergence…\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHE CORONAVIRUS, WHY IT REALLY HAPPEND...? .AMERICA BORROWED FROM CHINA, BACK IN 1933, $ 800 BILLION DOLLAR'S, AND NOW , IT DOESN'T WANT TO PAY IT BACK ...?

{"cid": "UgzkSL39cn-reCOjzMd4AaABAg", "text": "European here. It is very interesting to follow the debates etc. as an outsider. I have not been to the US (yet) so I don't know what it is like (to live) there with Trump as president (and in comparison to Obama prior). I can only go by what my american friends are telling me. Anyway, back to the debate/clip here. I think it is very obvious that Sanders has plans in mind, knows where he wants to go, a clear direction and you can tell by the confidence he emits when he makes his points. \n\nAt least in this clip, Biden looks like he is struggling, he does not really know how to respond to some questions or problems and uses general filler phrases instead. The \"no *new* fracking\" part immediately caught my attention. That was a moment where he definitely thought about how much he can lie to his voters and/or to his backers/donors, walking the fine line of \"technically saying the truth but leaving parts out\". \"No new fracking\" is a very flexible term here. What exactly does count as \"new\"? Does for example any already planned fracking but not yet executed fall under that? Additionally, he goes off-topic many times, trying to mask the fact that he is either out of points or just not well prepared to talk about for example climate change.\n\nOverall, I think Sanders absolutely won this one. He listens to scientists, researchers and other experts. And I mean actual experts from universities and research facilities etc. and not the random people the media often tends to label as such.\n\nI am not going to tell you who you should vote for in this case but please think about it for a good while. You only have to do this every 4 years so it is not too much to ask to put a little bit of effort into informing yourself, comparing every candidates points, looking at their history etc. Use the internet and do not listen to the media. Believe what you want to believe after you feel like you understood most aspects of it, not because others told you to do so.\n\nHowever, whatever you do, please do not re-elect Trump if you do not want to be the reason the US is the the laughing stock of this planet for another term.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "NoFailer", "channel": "UCSMlHofLJv4ZGWwvyG5yMvw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSu4jitBaxmdyk29ftNKQgIKpiLC_-rFiH0DsfF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That is the problem. he can't be a president in his state .in about 4-5 years he will show strong mental aging symptoms.I say this is the horror situation cause the alternatives are not even half as competent or maybe not even willing to do something for the people,but they have upper hand since they are much younger in general,more rich and organised. you leave in a vacation for 5 days and you want someone to paint your house while you are away.ho will you call to pain your house fast and well? your 90 years old neighbour that used to be one of the best painters in the world in his prime or the new younger and better equiped professionals that want to charge you triple money for same thing?hard choice,its all about how much you value your money and your home.really complex problem. if Bernie was 20 years younger now, Trump would be some rich guy in US you heard about and thats all,not even close to any leadership position in us gov. ,as for president?in his dreams maybe.

{"cid": "UgziqAzj5HcRdiUY9RV4AaABAg", "text": "Two blowhards discussing climate change and eliminating fossil fuels immediately while appearing on televisions and computers brought to the public as a result of fossil fuels and their abundance. Joe Biden's not about to put his classic Corvette out in the front yard and use it as a planter any more than Bernie is going to move into a tiny house, sell his other 3 houses and stop flying on private jets. We don't have viable options to fossil fuels at this point,  people have to commute and people can't afford boutique energy sources. The only rational thing to do at this point in time is seriously look at nuclear energy for electricity production. There are amply qualified scientists appearing all over Youtube that dispute the leftist 97% claims in terms of severity and immediacy of any required actions. In fact, the \"97%-of-scientists poppycock\" should read, \"97% of liberal, tax revenue, government student loan subsidy and grant money dependent college professors (i.e. scientists) agree that climate change is a major threat and conveniently implore the government to keep funding them as long as they decree the need to do so.\" The colleges and professors keep getting richer while the rest of us subsidize their largesse and see our quality of life decrease exponentially. The government creating scarcity of resources is not an answer to anything other than to those who wish to Lord over us. I'm not interested in having know-nothing politicians and faceless bureaucrats Lording over me. If climate change can be affected by our actions then cutting the red tape and promoting Nuclear energy is the only thing these pinheads should be considering. I can't fill my gas tank with windmills or solar cells, afford to pay $10/gallon for gas or use my car as a planter, walk 40 miles to work each day, nor wish to be beholding to Iran, the Saudis or Russia for gas if we shut down our production. A replacement for gasoline in our cars will come in time but we're not there and shutting down our oil and natural gas production is akin to shooting ourselves in the foot. Isn't it funny that \"progressive\" college professors don't ever suggest shutting down the old-fashioned, wasteful educational model consisting of brick and mortar universities nor promote on-line earning which would eliminate people having to drive to school and the need to heat or cool large classroom buildings and ancillaries. Did any of the 97% suggest such a thing? Nah. You see, colleges and universities are big business just like the oil companies their \"educators\" like to disparage.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Blacksummerrain", "channel": "UCCf9aYMZpueJ63y3zuLnbXQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSa36RN7SvLK6lO42yFoNLioIumOc-3Wnuqqg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is really more of a mitigation kind of question considering the fact that global warming no matter what we do will hit us in some way. How to reduce how bad it will be is the kind of stuff Jake Tapper is about how we could get malaria in Florida and Arkansas and who knows how far North. Biden answered to a small extent but it sounds like he was starting to go in a xenophobic Direction but then pulled back as he should because that's a bad place to go and had a half-assed answer. This is directly related to our current circumstance of covid - 19 where we need to think about not only the current crisis but how will deal with future crises in healthcare. The end my assessment is both candidates lost on this question. Bernie should have won cuz I feel like you should know better, but he didn't address the health issues especially disease transmission issues that will be part of global warming in the future. For example, viruses and bacteria that are released from glaciers that are human bodies have no idea what the hell they are because they haven't been around for who-knows-how-long. These are a thing. As is the fact that diseases that are more traditionally tropical diseases will be able to travel North as mosquitoes and other kind of vectors are able to flourish in latitudes they weren't able to before. It's also a matter of migration, we can't deny that fact as well but it's very dangerous to look at humans as the vectors.

{"cid": "UgzBAwbkQL-jEpkWyrZ4AaABAg", "text": "Vote for Biden?! Nonsense! What does Biden offer the people? He said to the rich; 'Don't worry. Nothing will fundamentally change.'. The rich isn't a monolith monster of the poor's nightmares. They are real people. Bankers, fossil industry execs, media execs, Wallstreet  suits, big pharma boys and such. They fund his campaign. They fund Republicans AND Democrats and have for years. That's who Biden spoke to. Their will be done. Their riches and wellbeing cared for. In decades of government, the House and Senate have worked to enact changes that benefit corporations and rich folks, not the average citizen. They do not reflect the public interest in their laws and votes. Look it up. This isn't hyperbole, it's fact. \n\nBiden wanted and worked for a lot of bills that ruined people's lives. Look up his record. He said he didn't care that young people are suffering. 'Give me a break!', he said when their struggles were brought up not too long ago. He wants to cut entitlements. He lies constantly. He lied tonight, many times and not one moderator fact-checked him! He lied and said he fought for civils rights and got arrested in South Africa trying to see an imprisoned Mandela. He's been lying for decades and steals glory. \n\nWhat does he offer regular voters? He says 'a return to normalcy, decency. America won't be a laughing stock.', yet what's decent about him? He inappropriately touches men, women and children (Trump's a rapist and sexual predator, so worse), lies (Trump lies too), curses voters (like Trump), threatens physical violence against voters (unlike Trump) who ask him questions, isn't bright (don't know which one is dumber), brags about the accomplishments of others - brazenly attributing them to himself (pretty much like Trump), he is in severe cognitive decline ( worse than Trump), he is corrupt; his corruption allowed him to collect donations (bribes) and then vote the way the donors wanted (same as Trump). His normalcy is going back to doing the bidding of his donors. That leaves the average guy to continue to not be able to discharge his debt, get a decent minimum wage, lose his job, not afford to go to the doctor when ill, worry a big, bad hurricane will blow his house down and much more. This is what is happening now. Biden offers the same existence as under Trump because they both work for the rich. Biden is a senile moron just like Trump (except Trump seems less senile). World leaders see this. World citizens see this and Biden's senility and lies are openly discussed in the news in various European countries and Australia (so the world will marvel at the incompetency and continue to laugh). Biden is factually incapable of governing just like Trump except Trump's dumber and lacts intellectual curiosity to learn to lead while Biden is senile and will be a puppet. So we suffer now, suffered under Obama, suffered before Obama, will continue to suffer under Biden. Biden wants wars and will continue to wage them just like Trump. He would veto Medicare for all, because his pharma donors and others don't want to pay practical taxes. So screw average Joe's illness! Let him go to the emergency room when his sickness is kiling him. So no, you're wrong. The orange monstrosity is horrible, but Biden's no better. Still not convinced? Trump appoints corporate friendly judges, so did Obama and so will Biden. Why? Money, corruption and the idolatry of big coperations are Biden's god. His record proves it. \n\nBiden claims he is against the ill treatment of migrants, wants to pass immigration reform and more, but never did anything to stop or help these issues, just the opposite. Claims he can get Republicans to work for and with him, yet sat his ass down and did nothing when he was Vice president?!? When someone has power and leadership and doesn't do shit, why give them more. To give it to them knowing your life will remain a misery and other poor demonized people's lives will not improve, is idiocy. It's not harm reduction because Biden will be harming us. Hyperbole?! No! He said he would veto Medicare for All if Congress passes it! Trump is a cancer, but giving senile puppet Biden who won't do any better, our vote, is suicide. By the way, who will be running the government??? Considering Biden's senility, he can only be a puppet.

Numerous times, Republicans pushed for large cuts, and Biden offered smaller but substantial cuts, in compromise. This was a wrong approach many Republicans aim to eventually, incrementally eliminate these programs altogether. Creating incremental reductions allows the GOP to make progress towards eventual elimination. Bernie is right. In every instance, Joe Biden was urging what amounted to cuts in social security. You can spin and explain the context all you want, but that's the fact. I assume Bernie left out the fact that during the Obama Administration, Joe Biden supported cuts to social security as part of a so-called \"Grand Bargain\" with the Republicans, who were too stupid to take them up on it. I assume Bernie left out this most recent example of Biden supporting social security cuts because he didn't want to be seen as critical of Barack Obama.     \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/05/176351738/obama-riles-his-own-party-with-social-security-offer\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2020/01/25/joe-biden-social-security/\n\nAlso, deficits are not the challenge that we've been led to believe.

He knew exactly what he was doing and you’re ignorant if you can’t see it. In that video, he wanted to freeze virtually ALL federal spending including social security COLA’s, but NOT SOCIAL SECURITY.

Run an ad quoting the part where he said social security, when he meant cost of living adjustments, and was hoping his supporters were too dumb to understand the context of wanting to freeze federal spending to address a deficit crisis that many at the time thought would cause an economic crash. He was right.\n\nFreezing social security COLA’s means everyone would have received the exact same social security check as the previous year, it just wouldn’t go up $24 to adjust for cost of living, for the duration of one year while the government balanced the budget.

His plan for paying for these things, of which he's only going to be able to provide 1/6 or thereabouts for (once the billionaires he's vilified so much take their money and leave the country basically as soon as he gets the nomination, precipitating a stock market crash) and he'll also cut our military defense spending (we currently spend more than any other country in the developed world combined) so he's basically gonna give people a small fraction of these things by completely destroying the fabric of this country as we know it. \n\nNeither one is going to do well vs. Trump. The best looking candidates in the race are long gone, but bad judgment is one thing liberals are kind of famous for. Now the final two remaining choices are basically bad vs. worse.

{"cid": "Ugx1v2ui0IaDzevObyN4AaABAg", "text": "They want to stop fracking and oil drilling here. Sanders talks of climate change that farmers wont be able to produce the food we need. If we put the oil and gas industry out of business we have two choices, buy oil from other nations and pay what they want for it. Second if he intends to stop all use of oil and gas from any where, how do we farm? Tractors need diesel to run on. The other issue is how to you go to work or get the food to the markets. There is no technology that can power trucks,tractors,dozers,excavators or any equipment to build or produce with other than diesel fuel. How do we produce steel to build with or make repairs to anything we have now? Wind and solar does not heat a steel mill. Wind and solar does not power our ships that bring goods from over seas. Wind and solar will not run a nation, or build roads or repair roads, because it takes oil to make asphalt to build roads and repair them. In fact many things we have and use everyday come from oil it is how we live and prosper. Maybe if we all will go back to just the family farm grow and store all we need no power tools horses to plow with, cows for milk and butter and meat, raise all that we eat no need for large stores just the small family owned ones, no cell phones, no tvs or modern anything.

He took two separate issues -- the corona virus, which we know very little about, and climate change -- and loaded it into one question with the hope that Bernie would underplay the importance of the current virus emergency and be humiliated.  And that was pretty shameful.  Jake Tapper is a snarky weasel, and he was that way even when he was with ABC.  If you have effective measures that can slow down and somehow prepare for all of the inevitable horrors from global warming, then the risk from whatever disease or damage to our health that global warming could possibly create would be of course be minimized as well.  This is a good example of why we can't even trust corporate media with a debate between two people.  The huge threat that global warming is waging upon us, which the corporate elite does not want to deal with because it gets in the way of business as usual,  is our number one threat.  The second number one threat is nuclear weapon proliferation, which the U.S. does not want to do anything about because our close friend in the middle east, Israel, would be the country more likely than not to use such a weapon on another country, but that phony corporate media hack Jake Tapper wouldn't want to talk about Israel and their nuclear weapons.  Oh no, we can't talk about that.

{"cid": "Ugw7wrXr3hPWUf_3xvd4AaABAg", "text": "Bernie Sanders wants America to commit suicide to solve a problem that does not exist.  There is no \"climate crisis\" and there is no \"greenhouse gas effect.\"  Dr. Ned Nikolov and Dr. Karl Zeller used advanced mathematical analysis techniques to study the climates of rocky surfaced planets and moons in our solar system.  They found they could accurately predict their long term average surface temperatures by knowing just two strategic facts: their distance from the Sun and their atmospheric pressure.  This formula has worked correctly for Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Pluto, and for Earth’s moon, Europa, Callisto, Titan, and Triton.  Their predictions have been proven accurate to within one degree Celsius.  Like the value of Pi, this mathematical relationship will never go away because it was created by Nature, not by man.\r  \n\nThis means that the specific gaseous composition of the atmospheres of planets and moons are irrelevant to determining their long-term average surface temperatures.  For example, the atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, while Earth’s atmosphere contains only .04% carbon dioxide, yet that information was not even needed to predict temperature.  The logical conclusion is that atmospheric gases only contribute to warming by their physical mass, which increases atmospheric pressure.  \rFor links to scientific details, please see New Climate Discovery at\r\nhttp://renewable.50webs.com/Zeller.Nikolov.html\r\n\r\nSee discussion of the ongoing NASA and NOAA data faking scandals at \r\nhttps://twitter.com/nikolovscience\r\n\r\nFor deep background climate science details, see Video Tutorial Cures Climate Hysteria at http://renewable.50webs.com/Video-Tutorial.html", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Christopher Calder", "channel": "UCvSKssyAcpW72YG-0bXTcEQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRQJSEALvByp3i1iJLqW6sUr_tYpFnItD0S4CZu=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So they are all working against Bernie to push their agenda, whether it hurts Americans or not and Americans are falling for it cause the word “taxes” and “socialism” have been made to made to sound as scary as possible even if it means universal healthcare where everyone and everything is covered with no extra costs! It’s way cheaper than paying insurance and even with insurance they don’t cover everything so you have out of pocket costs! With universal healthcare you don’t have out of pocket costs, detectable’s, just healthcare! You can still go to the same doctor, hospital, specialists at no extra cost!! Not enough People in America don’t see that the rich in America run the country! They run the government by paying off the politicians, they decide the policies that will be made so it doesn’t affect their bottom line, they don’t pay taxes, they decide who’s going to be elected! These are things Bernie wants to change and that’s why everyone is against him! It’s not cause Bernie has bad policies or has a horrible past behind him... it’s not even cause he’s the most likely person to beat Trump cause there’s nothing that Trump can use against him! It’s the rich being in control and them pushing a person that has obvious early stage Alzheimer’s or something along those lines, and Americans falling for the media’s lies rather than voting in their best interests cause they just want things before Trump was president instead of having things better than before Trump was elected!! There’s still time to change things, but every young voter at least will have to come out and vote in the primaries instead of sitting in front of their computers! There might be a chance cause older people might be afraid to vote cause of the Coronavirus! Everyone on the internet needs to spread the word to get people out to vote in the last few states! Trump’s a boarderline dictator, 4 more years and America will probably no longer be a democracy. If Biden’s elected and nothing changes it’s going to give way for an actual dictator next time around!! Bernie has to be elected! America’s future depends on it! Trump was elected in the first place cause people were frustrated and wanted something different, they wanted dramatic change.... what do you think of 4 years of Biden is going to do to the mentality of Americans? Someone is going to take advantage of that frustration like Trump has and destroy America for good! There’s more reasons than just getting rid of Trump as to why this election is so important! Change needs to happen! Americans need to wake up while there’s still time!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ᔕɧყ Luna", "channel": "UCsSdGV8Rhid4UTALXvcxV6Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQwkasJ2hcdP89Meyfms_BNoNLFJ39ya0-nbGJuXw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Free Market of PEOPLE answers: Enough for what – consumption or production? Socialists only think of consumption bc they are selfish. For consumption- relatively little but for production, expansion and continuation of production Billions, TRILLIONS. Yes expansion. It is expansion of your BEING & SOUL contrary to what Socialist liars told you! Expansion means expansion of goods and services, that is, expansion of progressively higher standard of life of people. If quantity of commodities increases on the market, prices decrease while Socialism necessarily decreases productive output of “unequal” pizzas & “unequal” aspirins & \"unequal\" doctors hence increases prices in order to eliminate those goods & services you know “because they are inequality”. Drop in supply on the market increases prices. So it is Production for the people, not for “them 1% billionaire class”.  Profit is simply a successful response to demand of people. “But how much” production for the people? How can the people endure these lower and lower prices and higher and higher standard of living, ask the Socialists saying: “you got spoiled with “Capital-ism” and failing to see life is oppression, that is to say, failing to see that life or free voluntary exchanges of people beneficial or good in their own eyes is not life, reality, beings or people but “ideology” called “system” or “corporate power structure” or “Wall-street”.

And Joe Biden hasn't done shit either but steal from tax payers, fatten his pockets and take money from corporations to pass Bill's that benefit them. I was a Democrat for decades, voted Obama twice, finally started really paying attention and doing my OWN research,  get news reports from all sides, and take it and look into it myself. Found out that all MSM was lying and producing PROPAGANDA. A bill that Obama signed allowed for media to lie to the American people and use propaganda.  So I started looking into congress men and women, on both sides. Started seeing crimes committed from them. Most have been removed on the Republican side, but there are still a few left. But on the left, it is RIDDLED with corruption. Election rigging/tampering, tax money laundering/stealing. They pass aid Bill's to Book publishing companies, millions and millions, and the publishing companies have \"sister companies\". Smaller companies with different names but still owned by the major publishing company (Pearsons publishing I THINK), Next, the Publishing companies give book deals to these people in our government, for the exact amount of money that congress gave them, minus a small percentage for doing the deal. They do the same thing with foreign aid, (Hunter & Joe Biden). Romney & his son, Pelosi & her son, Kerry's & son, all energy/gas companies, all their sons were put on the boards of these companies, with no experience,  millions of OUR tax dollars sent over, routed through multiple banks in foreign countries, and eventually ends back up to energy companies. The companies keep a small percentage for the deal, the rest is sent back via \"paycheck\" to whoever son is on the board, and only has to show up to job 1 or 2 times a year. Also with Planned Parenthood, they send millions, PPH keeps percentage and sends the rest back via \"donations \" to the DNC or Hillary foundation.  Go ask yourself why Dems have been fighting so hard to keep PPH and to continue sending \"foreign aid\" to countries that NEVER get better, cleaner or richer. Now lastly, ask yourself how they get \"good\" lawful congressmen and women to agree with them and vote to pass their Bill's to send all this money, that's where Jeffrey Epstein came into play, he would provide \"entertainment\", young girls/boys kids etc.. all while secretly recording them.  He would allow them to do anything they wanted to these people. Kill them, rape them, eat them, etc... If it happens to be a good person that doesn't do that stuff, they eventually get drugged/setup and recorded to use and blackmail all of them. This involves CEOs, ACTORS/ACTRESSES,  Judges, police leaders, Congress, Presidents, Princes, Priests, News reporters/owners etc. That is why a select group of people have for 3 years attacked President Trump nonstop to try and get him removed. Because Trump ran on \"he's gonna drain the swamp\" (corrupted criminals in our government). He was best for the job because he was part of their group at 1 time, (minus the parts with kids), he knows all their dirty secrets. \"Those who shout the loudest, have the most to lose\"... now who has it been? The Dems that were shouting are the ones that were part of the money laundering, the actors, Tom Hanks, Robert Deniro, etc. There is a MASSIVE arrest going on right now as I type. The ones that decided to talk and make deals with Trump, and the ones that are clean and on his side are now Patriots. In UK, there was a leader that left a building with Red folder, walked behind a car, came out the other side and the folder was now green. There was a picture of the White House with a red tint, and now it is a green tint, the other day on the capitol building is a video of a green rabbit inside of the letter Q displayed on the top/side of the capitol. And theres many many more... From RED TO GREEN. It's the greenlight showing that it's go time. That's why they want everyone off the streets, it's easier to track everyone, under the cover of this virus. Don't take my word, go look it up, research it. You can do FOIA REQUESTS (freedom of information act requests) and ask for the emails, texts etc. Of your congressmen and women, by law they must provide it to you, unless it's classified. Again, do your own research, we have been lied to and stolen from for DECADES.....

{"cid": "UgxamAxJYjXqgaoCa1B4AaABAg.96FJCmYFM9a96GMT9G9h6-", "text": "​ @Benjamin Selassie  Some responses to your last two comments:\n- Yes, some workers do own some, and a few own all of a company and that's fine.  Rewarding stock is standard practice - but the Fed'l Gov't isn't allowed to SEIZE it permanently.\n\n\n- Gov't can tax / regulate activities like off-shoring to influence decisions, but Bernie is banning it.  E.g. It's poor economic policy to raise super-high tariffs on all trade willy-nilly, but this is more akin to just cutting off trade.  Competing and capitalism require a level playing field, not extreme protectionism.\n\n\n- Healthcare is certainly in need of reform, but M4A is not the panacea it has been described to be.  Actually executing it as a project has to be done through trialing (like medical treatment, eh?), never mind financially vetted.  Bernie's been blowing smoke up everyone's gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\nAs pitched, almost all technological development in medicine would cease - and I don't know about you, but I was hoping for solutions to cancer, Alzheimers, diabetes, etc.  \n\n\nThe relatively tiny ACA couldn't even get a simple web site right, plus gobs of their justifications and assumptions were just plain wrong.  M4A is a 60% INCREASE IN THE FED'L GOV'T!  Based on the delays and massive cost overruns of VIRTUALLY EVERY Gov't project in the past (Remember the $700 military hammers?), what could possibly go wrong?\n\n\n- I'm all for infrastructure spending, if done judiciously (e.g. updating bridges and highways).  But mandating that we tear down almost every building to improve its energy use is ludicrous.  Just the act of doing that will likely lead to a net rise in carbon use across the globe to say nothing of the unjustifiable (and HUGE) expense.  Maybe after we simply stop bridges from collapsing and potholes from swallowing Smart cars, we could consider doing a bit of the infrastructure work that was naively outlined in the GND. \n\n\n- Minimum wage should go up, but $15/hr in Los Angeles and $15/hr in Podunk, Mississippi are two vastly different things.  Since it's federal, the amount should be at the low end so rural Mom 'n Pop stores can afford to exist and hire more people.  States and cities should adjust accordingly.  But, yeah, time to raise it some.\n\n\n- Interestingly, as you allude to, Bernie used to be very much like Trump on immigration issues - strong border and lots of protectionism against immigrants (legal and illegal) \"stealing\" Americans' jobs.  He either had an epiphany, or a political change of heart, and that's why he's almost Mr. Open Borders with consequent Hispanic support.  \n\n\nPersonally, I believe we need many more immigrants, as they can be the life-blood of innovation in \"the land of opportunity.\"   I am, however, in favor of being more selective by skill to some degree, rather than simply by having relatives here.  Illegal immigration needs to be gotten under control and not rewarded every generation with citizenship.\n\n\n\"The Middle Class\" are the people who actually pay a net positive in taxes and are not the top couple %.  They will be burdened with all these massive spending programs Bernie has dangled out there in the name of democratic socialism, because, as Willie Sutton said, \"That's where the money is.\"  You may trust Bernie to spend all of your money, but I don't.\n\n\nGetting rid of Trump is an imperative, not just because he's a menace at the job, but because he's a narcissistic sociopath with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  However, it's nice to know our system/country is so strong that it could abide the reign of such an affliction.  We could (probably) survive Bernie too.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "George Hugh", "channel": "UCxopTD1JZokDL_ZH-HK8yIg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSFzMkRy2a2FHUCCfDSJRxj1Q6TFxNNP11VfM_o=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Illegal immigration from the southern border is my problem.\n\nThere is a certain amount of illegal immigration any country is going to expect but because this country identifies with race over ideas, a country like this needs a way more diverse yet numerically similar voting block. However, there is human capital to mine in this country if we give citizens access to resources. All immigrants that come here are in 2 generations culturally from America. That means they adopt the traits people look down on US citizens for. \n\nThis isn't a problem that gets solved by more immigrant to be the working class. We have to change how we think of our own people and how we think of ourselves. \n\nThen places that have a need for refuge wouldn't face the same level of xenophobia. This is more behaviour than anything else. On average people don't like new people and less so if it becomes a competition for resources. \n\nBy capitalistic logic, what's happening at the border makes perfect sense.

{"cid": "UgxBHy0b2mOCKnvbGdZ4AaABAg", "text": "Bernie, Bernie, systemic problems, climate change, billionaires, billionaires we want socialism. Look, do you know anything about Socialism and that things will need to be not simply wanted but actually produced under Socialism? Do you know how things are financed in reality [as opposed to Socialism]?  PROFIT (\"them Billions\")– result greater than the cost (of production) is how things are actually founded and can only be founded sustainably. If socialism cannot cover the cost of its own production, if production cannot be financed it ceases to exist. That’s why Socialism is always fuzzy and unclear on one of the most vital details: Financing – how are you going to pay for it practically? Socialism never answers that. GRADUAL – over the years decline in the quantity of supply of goods and services isn’t evidence of Socialism “Maybe still working”. It isn’t, it never was. It was just emptying your pockets, then imploding as it can only insofar as its financing is based on TAXPAYERS themselves (“the rich” as Socialists like to brand them) lol rather than on \"billions of billionaires\". Hope changes into delusional desperation just when you get older and actually need to see a physician Socialism now made inaccessible. Socialism never materializes because it can’t pay for things realistically. \nHospital is a business, education is a business, food supply yes - a business: people who produce those things want to be paid, that is only if you want to see more food coming in the future. When paid, there is profit left for continuous operation of production. That’s how things are normally created in reality as opposed to ideology of idealists and academics. If there is no profit, there is no production. Socialist crock-pot answer is: tax “the rich” aka anyone and everyone who works for living. That is the Socialist con: Under free market it is corporations themselves who finance production. Under Socialism it is YOU the taxpayers who do the financing out of your own wallets. And since this is not a rational way to finance production of anything, every other sector of the economy is affected by mis-allocation of capital. This socialist inefficiency rapidly starts costing more, more and more money now out of your pocket until hello Venezuela. \nDon’t point to Europe like a complete, neurotic dupe. In truth, WHITE PEOPLE, not “Socialism” is that which in Europe works, by not over-drawing public resources when “free”. If it was not a lie Socialism worked in Europe, it would’ve worked in non-white countries. You’ve been lied to. Your vanity has been well-fed by Socialist scum. Socialists exploited people’s doubt and moral weakness. That’s all they do. But Norway! Not “Norway”.

Arguments to supposed \"Socialist Extremity\" are false, anathema and a total distraction by the status quo of special interests and establishment practices in a hyper capitalist extreme society otherwise known as \"The United States of America\" where money and power rule all and dystopian propaganda and a broken system of poor education and oligarchy convince the population to consistently vote against and believe against their own interests and those of the world. Sanders policy's are completely reasonable and desperately needed and in many cases are the norm in much of Europe which although having many problems of course consistently does better in life expectancy, healthcare, education and well being for members of classes other than elite. It's time for America to earn back it's reputation as the greatest country on Earth because it has sadly become an international embarrassment to the civilized world through no fault of the vast majority of it's decent people. Why can't America have the same pragmatism and true self interest for once? Because when you guys consistently harm yourself with your vote not only do you suffer but so does the rest of the world because of the influence of America. I would far rather have a sensible pragmatist with the interest of many at heart than an old school centrist with the interests of a few desperately trying to cling on to his political career as well as his cognitive faculties, Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Some of Bernie's supporters voted for Trump and some stayed home. Why do you think 2020 will be any different. Check this out. Corona virus is out and the republicans are looking into Yangs Idea. Even the republicans can see now there is substance in what Yang had to offer. THE DNC should wake up and not try to use their establishment to push Bidden on the people. Im so passionate about this cos i am an example. What do you say to a young man like me, black young man who lost his father at 18.

{"cid": "UgxM69ikfPtgfprYLWt4AaABAg", "text": "Socialism fails wherever tried because it is committed to faulty method. Socialism deals not with reality but with ideas - idea of “humanity as a whole” or with other “holistic” concepts “food”, “housing”, “healthcare”, “education” as opposed to degrees. Such concepts are not things but ideas advertised as things. Commodities or things minus prices are not things but ideas in your head. Socialism cannot work because its goal is removal of the corner stone of real things: prices, conditions to entry or \"barriers to access\". Healthcare without prices which cover cost of production over time is not healthcare but negation of healthcare, ideology of healthcare. Prices or conditions are not external to healthcare, not “impurities” or “pollution” in healthcare but healthcare in itself. Prices of healthcare ARE healthcare. Prices are the nature of healthcare. Prices of healthcare are the universal healthcare. Healthcare not connected to producers by prices is not healthcare. Healthcare independent of conditions of time & place, that is, healthcare outside space & time is not real healthcare but gap in healthcare, idea, ideology in reality, Muller Healthcare. \nIn this way Socialism is not responding to reality bc it is not responding to people. People don’t want “food”, “housing”, “healthcare”, “education” . People want things in time & place, namely, people want very specific & particular [read: ‘unequal’] degree, kind, quality, quantity etc of food or house or education or healthcare at every point in time. The opposite of “Free” are “prices”. Prices are signals to producers what people actually want to consume at a given [“unequal”]  time & place. The miracle of prices informs producers about all that they need to know to respond to people’s actual demand & maintain that response over time. Prices tell producers who wants what, when, where, how much or up to what point. Prices consumers send to producers about their desires is the most vital element in people. Without prices there is no people bc there is no production for the people. “Food”, “housing”, “healthcare”, “education” without prices are not commodities but concepts. No one ever wants “food” or “education” or “healthcare”. Those are ideas of idealists, not things people in time & place actually ask for. Socialism fails bc it doesn’t respond to people, it responds not to reality but to arbitrary concepts outside of time & place.
