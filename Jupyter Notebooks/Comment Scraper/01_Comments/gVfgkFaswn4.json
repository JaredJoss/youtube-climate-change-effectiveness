Biofuel is part of the problem, I agree, as it pollutes as fossil fuels do, on top of its extensive land use. You might be right about windmills, note that is only one of the many renewable energies though, and, again, you are not giving me any piece of evidence about it. About CO2 release from the oceans (which I was not familiar with, thank you for bringing it to my knowledge): according to this article by NOAA, due to human-caused CO2 emissions this process could actually be reversed, forcing the oceans to absorb too much CO2 and resulting in ocean acidification, that would heavily damage molluscs and crustaceans and potentially destroy the whole sea ecosystem we rely on. Check it out: https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/ocean-atmosphere-co2-exchange/. Also, i quote you: ¬´The Earth is historically cold right now, not historically hot.¬ª That might be true if you consider earth temperature history as a whole, but if you consider earth temperature during human history (which is what interests us, as our survival, and not that of the planet, is at stake), a sudden warming since the industrial age is detectable. Check it out, from NASA: https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php#:~:text=As%20the%20Earth%20moved%20out,Celsius%20over%20about%205%2C000%20years.&text=When%20global%20warming%20has%20happened,years%20to%20warm%205%20degrees. Also: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/. Dear Rick, please take your time to carefully read these articles. I really hope you will see the problem, as it will affect us all deeply. I don't care about being right. I hate being right about this. But it's not a matter of who's right and who's wrong: it's a matter of survival. Let's then understand each other and act together to make this world a better place for our future. I won't be answering from now on, you're free to take your place as the \"winner\" in this debate, in spite of the various scientific articles I linked for everyone to see. If you don't see the point, though, I'm afraid both of us will definitely lose.

Articles from 100 years ago and shady conspiracist videos on youtube are not reliable source of information. Let me tell you something. I live in Venice, Italy. Yep. The one with gondolas and canals. Since my childhood I witnessed the sea level rising (and no, subsidence is not enough to justify it), rougher weather patterns, a hotter and wetter summer every year. In the mountains, less snow and higher temperatures, glaciers shrinking. Floods, storms, heat-induced strokes for elder people. We just have 5 years of unprecedented extreme weather patterns; all recorded. And take a look at the world: it's happening everywhere. See the wildfires in California and Australia; see pacific islands literally disappearing; see the extreme weather patterns in the USA of the last years. Go tell the people that lost everything your enlightening conspiracy theories (the fact that you are labelling it as \"commie scam\" really speaks for itself: see Angela Merkel, belonging to a christian right-wing party, CDU, and see her stand on climate change). Come out of your conspiracist cave with evidence-free videos and face reality.

{"cid": "Ugxu86IrXSYVFzmM70V4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

The factories, producing grey smoke, are fossil fuels. However it causes many problems.\n\nWe need to convince companies all around the world, especially the Koch's company's, to use a different source of power around the world, solar, electricity, water and wind generators, instead of using carbon, fossil and fuel. \n\nMost people in the world needs to drive an Electric car, so it can decrease the amount of carbon that is in the area. That's still a rather new thing, so people worldwide are driving carbon fuelled cars (Unleaded and diesel), they're unaware of the consequences the carbon-dioxide fuelled cars will create if they keep using them.\n\nCompanies should create electricity generators, solar and others, to make the world overall a better place. Climate change would be eliminated, the animals would be unaffected, as well as us humans.\n\nWe need to decrease the rate and minimise deforestation.  Global Warmings rapidly heat up the seas, for one example, the corals in the deep sea are also affected, making them \"bleached\" and not so beautiful any more. They're also not habitable any more.\n\nThere are a select few companies who are concerned about global warming and they know the consequences of the world that will happen, unlike many others, they try to minimise that risk.\n\nSome companies use a new idea of factories. One person is Musk, who is using Gigafactories to produce electricity which is more safer than the fossil fuels.\n\nThe Koch brothers need..

{"cid": "UghWQf8PnliI-3gCoAEC", "text": "Quite a rousing speech, but there are several glaring, problematic omissions.  Mind you I‚Äôm not disputing climate science here, rather I‚Äôm showing crucial points that counter the narrative that says business as usual, status quo, self-preservation is ‚Äúalready solving the problem.‚Äù\n\n1.  In spite of decades and trillions already spent on renewable energy development, there is still no significant long term decline in the percentage of total energy humanity consumes from fossil fuels.  It is still at 85%, as Gore points out, but he doesn‚Äôt tell you that it‚Äôs been thereabout since record keeping began.  Even more worrying is the fact that economic growth and fossil fuel consumption are still moving upward in lock step.  Something which should be cause for alarm for people who continue to insist that this cancerous growth model is sustainable and necessary.  There is no reliable evidence that this death coupling will permanently separate anytime soon, especially when you consider how all renewables require massive fossil fuel feed stocks that plunge us deeper into the ‚Äúenergy trap‚Äù.\n2. The growth rate in wind and solar is expected to flatten out starting in the 2020s as efficiency and cost improvements dry up and scaling difficulties harden.  From about 30% annual increases on installed capacity to about the single digits.  At that rate it could take over a century to power the world with wind and solar.  Time we don‚Äôt have.  Meanwhile, the EIA estimates global energy demand to increase 57% by 2040.  Even the more conservative estimates by the EIA say that by 2040, renewables will account for only 15% of world consumption, compared to 11% in 2010.  Piss poor!\n3. Battery technologies based on lithium will suffer their own scaling problems due to scarcity of materials.  Even with more abundant minerals, lead in particular, they are not abundant enough and adding in redundancies for power outages and intermittency will increase costs by several multiples.  Estimates for the cost a global battery infrastructure run into the tens of trillions of dollars.\n4. The EROI for most renewables is abysmal compared to fossil fuels.  PV solar is estimated at 5:1 (at best), newer solar concentrators are no more than 10:1.  Researchers argue that we need between 5-9 EROI to maintain our wanton lifestyles.  Effective net gains globally may be much lower.\n5. Probably the most deluded assumption is asserting that a ‚Äúgrid parity‚Äù crossover is all that is required for a worldwide turnaround to clean green energy.  The reality is that these changes should have been pursued decades ago, when there wasn‚Äôt a direct financial incentive.  It may already be too late to preserve this civilization for large swaths of people around the world.\n\nBrace yourself‚Ä¶", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Giordano Bruno", "channel": "UCc9euscQGgLwZCxx4asr1tA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQumzWZ5B-XlMxXPrfNOBFNY2sCgJL9vZRHRn99Rw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Not for a blind person. Do your eyes see blue? No, the brain perceives the colour according to its presuppositional knowledge base. Information does not arise spontaneously from matter, nor does matter give rise to consciousness - its Intelligent consciousness that gives rise to information and matter.\n\nSo I perceive that your scientific knowledge is stuck back in the pre 2000 era, and you have not been diligent to stay with the pace, hence why your comments are both outdated and irrelevant:)", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "delawarecop", "channel": "UCb7RnDCoDEikUvCpF6NwO3A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSN2r73mCGNZCo--5X8nLeRXpFXE0_uHRV0V_D-=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also man made climate change in scientific circles tends to be talked about with regards to the last half century or so because solar forcing can be attributed as the primary cause of most of the warming in the first half of the 20th century, but not so for most of the later half.\n\nAs a note this is because our collective forcing rose out of what could be dismissed as natural background variation in the later half of the century, more so in the last few decades or so when temperatures rose independently of solar activity.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
