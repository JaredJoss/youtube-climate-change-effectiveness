The only job of greenhouse gases is to regulate the amount of the sun's energy that is present at the Earth's surface at any given moment.  They do this in three ways.  First, they absorb as much of the energy as they can or as is necessary.  Secondly, they block a portion of the energy from ever reaching the surface.  Lastly, the energy that is reflected off of the planet's surface is reflected back towards the surface.  Well, at least some of it.  Some does escape back into space.  It is well understood that an increase in greenhouse gases will result in less of the reflective energy from escaping and thus be reflected back to the surface, but few seem to realize that it would inevitably block more of the sun's energy from reaching the surface, as well.

The French aristocracy wore animal pelts as undergarments, even shortly before the French Revolution.  George Washington and the Valley Forge disaster happened in 1777.  The Dalton Minimum lasted into the early 1800's.  Napoleon's Army was destroyed by the Winter of 1812.  The Summer that Never Was was in 1816.  The Winters of 1830 & 1836 were record-breaking and vicious.  The Potato Famine was in the 1840s.  There was a Medieval Warming Period, though, from 900 to 1350.  \n\nIt's criminal to use children to advance a money-grabbing, a power-grabbing scheme, and the eugenicists dream, in claiming that \"extra humans\" are destroying the Earth via life-giving CO2.  Plus,  in the Obama years, even 112 BILLION of US taxpayer dollars was shelled out to activists and scientists for climate change \"adaptation\", for 2014 alone.  Another $10 to $20 billion yearly, for \"research.\"\n\nBy the way, the law of Baroclinic Instability and Gradient Forcing is such that higher temps will result in less intense storms, due to the lesser degree of temp difference between the Equator of the Poles.   \n\nAnd concerning Bill Nye's rant over the \"Thermohaline\" and Greenland melt:  It's Ekman Transport,  ocean gyre motion, and the Coriolis Effect, along with all high pressure systems' natural affinity to move toward low pressure systems is what moves the oceans.  Moreover, mountain ice, such as Greenland's vaporize, when low pressure is present and sunlight is providing 72 calories of thermal energy per cm3 of ice/snow.\n\nLots of US taxpayer dollars are involved in the Global Warming Scare.  Thus, those scientists funded as such have a Conflict of Interest and can't be trusted in conveying the truth about climate.  Climategate I proved this to be the case, along with Pausegate, Gleickgate, Glaciergate, etc.  All that the US taxpayer saw was a group of scientists fudging the data and crying wolf, in order to receive grants amounting to a hundred billion+ taxpayer dollars per year.  Next comes the profitable Carbon Credits, Carbon Tax, and an excuse to institutionalize sterilization, abortion, and euthanasia.

{"cid": "UgxhNnMUP_Nxa1TUaDN4AaABAg", "text": "The propaganda was fine until it reached 55 seconds and everything after that is environmentalism hogwash. A theory of man made global warming which is not science and has been proved wrong time and time again. All (Over 100+) UN climate models have been wrong against observable data. No average warming for 20 years. The poles have as much ice as 30 years ago, the seas have not risen much in 50 years, storms are not getting stronger and are fewer in number, no more droughts than normal, no more floods than normal. CO2 a trace gas is a plant food and is vital to all life on the planet. More CO2 means a greener planet as plants need less water to grow\n\nClimate Change is a religion based of christian doomsayers from the book of Revelations. ie \"Repent the end is nigh\" \nEarth has a natural cycle of warming and cooling depending on the heat output of the Sun (Sun spots), precession, solar winds, cloud covering, volcanic activity, The Moons position over the North or Southern hemisphere, Earths gravitational and magnetic forces. Which has effected it for 4.5 billion years. \nEarths warming did not change in 1700 because of man, the earth has naturally been warming since 15000 years with a min-ice age 400 years ago. Sea levels have risen 400 feet in that time and all of it natural.\nFinally the Paris Agreement will not attend to any climate change issues. It a social justice method to redistribute wealth from Christian countries (sin tax) and give it to poorer mainly non christian countries. Remember the basis of this religion is all about its man's fault and we must all repent or be doomed. Paris Agreement in a nutshell.
