I know we tolerated each other for many years for the sake of future generations, but sadly, this relationship has clearly run its course. Our two ideological sides of America cannot and will not ever agree on what is right for us all, so let's just end it on friendly terms. We can smile and chalk it up to irreconcilable differences and go our own way.\n \nHere is our separation agreement: \n\n--Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a similar portion. That will be the difficult part, but I am sure our two sides can come to a friendly agreement. After that, it should be relatively easy! Our respective representatives can effortlessly divide other assets since both sides have such distinct and disparate tastes.\n \n--We don't like re-distributive taxes so you can keep them.\n \n--You are welcome to the liberal judges and the ACLU\n \n--Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA, and the military.\n \n--We'll take the nasty, smelly oil industry and the coal mines, and you can go with wind, solar and bio-diesel\n \n--You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O'Donnell. You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to move all three of them.\n \n--We'll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart, and Wall Street.\n \n--You can have your beloved lifelong welfare dwellers, food stamps, hippies, druggies, and illegal aliens.\n\n--You can keep Goggle, Twitter and Facebook.  We can straighten out Amazon.\n \n--We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, greedy CEOs, and rednecks\n \n--We’ll keep Hannity, Carlson, and Bibles, and give you NBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, and Hollywood\n \n--You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places that threaten us.\n \n--You can have the peaceniks and war protesters.\n \n--When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security.\n \n--We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values.\n \n--You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Humanism, and political correctness. You can also have the UN, but we will no longer pay the bill.\n \n--We'll keep the SUV's, pickup trucks, and oversized luxury cars. You can take every Volt, Prius, and Leaf you can find.\n \n--You can give everyone healthcare if you can find any practicing doctors.\n \n--We'll keep \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and \n\"The National Anthem.\"\n \n--I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute \"Imagine,\" \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,\" \"Kumbaya “or” We Are the World.\"\n \n--We'll practice trickle-down economics and you can continue to give trickle up poverty your best shot.\n \n--Since it often so offends you, we'll keep our history, our name and our flag.\n \nWould you agree to this?   If so, please pass it along to other like-minded liberal and conservative patriots and if you do not agree, just hit delete.

That somehow, we’re going to put in jeopardy this beautiful little blue-green ball that’s just a-floatin’ around the sun? The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through all kinds of things worse than us: been through earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drifts, solar flares, sunspots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles, hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids and meteors, worldwide floods, tidal waves, worldwide fires, erosion, cosmic rays, recurring ice ages,", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "budmangt2", "channel": "UCVlkNGp-hRRx2MrrS6U35gQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTbDRmAWifsI2NiIpfn3sKTHtPESkgX6Aiz4j9Nzg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw2HL6jjf3LNZL6xax4AaABAg", "text": "Carbon taxes are folly. Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I’ve witnessed it with my own eyes. \n\nBorn and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature’s powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars orbits each planet with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. \n\nSo the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. \n\nThe first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto or paleo diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. This will not only improve your health and eliminate T2D, but more importantly it will incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soils and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. \n\nSee the best keto diet here https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ\n\nThe second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement is as follows. \n\n1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\n2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\n3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\n4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\n5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\n6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon’t be misanthropic with the debunked carbon dioxide nonsense. Be positive. Be useful.

{"cid": "UgzlpAmSY2Lzf195FgN4AaABAg", "text": "Do You Understand that Democrats will Destroy America?\r\nBy Carol Greenwald\r\nI earn my living investing other people’s money in the stock market. I am terrified contemplating how I am going to save my clients’ money, as well as my own, if a Democrat is elected president. The policies that the Democrats are advocating will destroy the American economy, not just the stock market, but the whole US economy. My first instinct will be to raise cash ahead of the stock market crash, but even that is only a temporary safe harbor.\r\nThe Green New Deal, renewed regulations, Medicare for All, free college, as well as the 70-90% tax rates proposed by Democrats, will tank the stock market and US economic growth, leading to higher unemployment and reduced wage gains. All these programs require higher taxes and not just the soak the rich fantasy of the 70-90% rates. Most of the Democratic candidates have pledged to roll back the 2017 Republican tax cuts that fueled the renewal of economic growth in the US.\r\nOpen borders will flood the US with poverty stricken immigrants and their competition for jobs will depress wages. The social welfare needs of the immigrants will skyrocket government expenditures. So while taxes receipts are falling due to slower economic growth rates, expenditures will be rising, leading to increased government debt and consequently higher interest rates. If the Federal Reserve tries to keep interest rates low to prevent a deepening recession, then the increase in the money supply and the expanding deficit will eventually destroy the value of the dollar. So much for my safe harbor in cash.\r\nImmigration: What do Open Borders Mean?\r\nMilton Friedman pointed out over a decade ago, you cannot have open borders and a social welfare state… the supply of immigrants will become infinite.\r\nVirtually all of the Democratic candidates have advocated for opening the border to all who want to come. All the Democratic candidates on the second night of the debate supported free health benefits for illegal immigrants and several have advocated for free college for all. But even without these additional incentives, the level of living available in the US, even to the poorest Americans, far exceeds what many of the world’s peoples can hope for in their own countries. No one starves in America. Our poor have cars, large screen TVs, air conditioning, video games for their kids and eat better than the average GI in World War II.\r\nThis is an invitation to all the world’s poor to come to the US in unlimited numbers. All you need is to get to our southern border. The number of people living in poverty in Latin America in 2017 was 184 million.\r\nBut immigration will not be limited to the poverty stricken in our own hemisphere. There are 750 million people who live below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day. By that standard, those coming from Latin America are not the most desperate. People will find a way to come to the US from Africa, possibly trafficked by cartels and other criminal gangs, as are many coming from Latin America now. (Have you ever wondered how poverty stricken people manage to travel 1400 miles, often with children and obtain food and water for the trip, and then arrive at our southern border in non-ragged clothes?) Since May of this year, 1100 illegal immigrants from Africa were interdicted at the southern US border. More will be coming.\r\nWith open borders, the economy of the US will sink under the demands for social services to be provided for a population that will overwhelm citizens living here now. But those advocating open borders do not put America first. They are “citizens of the world” and feel it is unfair that Americans have a higher standard of living than others. They will ensure that we don’t for much longer.\r\nTax the Rich Delusion\r\nThe race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination is quickly becoming a contest to determine which candidate wants to tax the rich the most. Democratic candidates have been attracted to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal to tax incomes over $10 million at a 70% rate. Not to be outdone, Ilhan Omar has proposed a 90% top rate.\r\nBut what are the benefits and costs of these proposals beyond the fun of calling to soak the rich? According to the Tax Foundation, a 70% tax on all income over $10 million would raise only $51.4 billion over ten years and lose revenue in the first two years of its enactment because people would forego capital gains. The federal budget is estimated to collect $3.645 trillion in taxes in fiscal 2019, so the increased tax revenue will be trivial in terms of changing the actual amount of taxes the US government will have to spend, but it will have strong disincentives on entrepreneurship. It is America’s high rate of innovation and entrepreneurship that account for American economic success and wealth.\r\nMedicare for All\r\nThe cost of Medicare for All means that the availability of Medicare for those on it now will be sharply reduced. The current level of Medicare cannot be provided to vastly more people without bankrupting the country. But even if it could, services would have to be cut sharply because we do not have the doctors and hospital beds to service vast new numbers of eligible people. Some candidates like Bernie Sanders admit that you will not be able to keep your private health insurance even if you want to, and that your taxes will go up to pay for this new benefit; others like Joe Biden lie and say if you like your plan you can keep your plan and Sen. Kamala Harris denies that your taxes will rise. But Medicare for all will be another costly program that will increase the national debt.\r\nThe Green New Deal\r\nTo those who believe that climate change is the existential threat facing America (not Iran or China), destroying the US economy to save the planet is a fair trade. Doing away with fossil fuels now that the US has become the world’s largest provider of oil and natural gas and has become energy independent is a sure way to cripple the US economy and to hand economic might to China and Russia who will not face the same restrictions. So not only will the Green New Deal destroy the US economy, but possibly also our freedom, as we decline economically and our adversaries, China and Russia, continue growing in economic strength without these restrictions.\r\nTrump is the only choice\r\nWhatever you think of President Trump, you know by his record that he will put America first and that his policies have created a robust economy. Unless you want to see the US economy and your standard of life destroyed, there is no alternative to voting for President Trump.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Cánh Thép Channel", "channel": "UCkhpKcxWjEnIRon3PsBS_tA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTfIihDBmo5KWuiQVleEbMGzXv_f8pzoWVPgAxcIoY=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzUrpFTzEiVJXvX30h4AaABAg", "text": "Here's a fun anecdote that shows how much they really care. It's long but true. \nMy father was a race car driver in the 60s/70s. In his travels he got to know a guy named Ralph Moody who was an engine wizard that built NASCAR engines in the early Richard petty era. In the 70s there were multiple gas shortages which inspired him to build mainstreet engines focused on gas mileage. He did so. (I heard this story straight from the horse's mouth). He built a diesel car engine that got 90 miles per gallon & a standard engine that got 68 in the 1970s. During an advertisement campaign where Moody drove his \"Moody Diesel\" from coast to coast in 1979 when smog was 1st becoming an issue he was repeatedly pulled over by cops (almost as if they were ordered to harass him) During this process his car was repeatedly inspected with smog detectors... They couldn't register a reading because the engine burned cleaner than anything that has ever hit the road... \nMoody's engines would also come with a lifetime guarentee to never break btw. \nAfter going public, offers to buy his patents started rolling in, & so did threats in late night phone calls.  Eventually Moody sold his patents for 90% less than original offers because the EPA ruled his engine unfit citing \"unknown long term environmental impact.\" In other words a clean burning engine that got 5x the MPG than average cars in the late 70s & came with a lifetime guarentee was shut down... by the \"Environmental Protection Agency\" LOL!!! \nOut of fear he would be killed for informing the public that engines 10x better than what we had could be available anytime Moody sold his patents & signed a non compete clause agreeing to never build anything of the kind again. That technology has sat in a vault somewhere since 1980 while the government continues to use the \"climate crisis\" as one of it's biggest money makers for their corporate masters.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Scott Broyles", "channel": "UCUyJo1-HpGw-lIz8dUHoWZw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRTgIqFAojNO4PfSOhzl0SHpdki4sZAIQzaCw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What about your mom dad grandparents who may be on a fixed income is joe Biden gonna buy each of them a car like this. How are fixed income people going to afford that does that even matter? Not to mention what happens to the cars they have that are paid off and run off of gas will it even be allowed to own one and at the least if they are allowed where are they going to get the gas for it. Can’t y’all see straight through the bullshit this man is feeding y’all. Slowly but surely everything that’s ever existed by choice will be taken away because if he’s all that about preserving this planet of life that has existed just fine for many centuries off of oil and gas u better get ready to make sure you can afford one of those all electric cars and u better make damn sure you have the credit to buy one.. hmm wonder if our so smart president considered all these matters before saying he’s gonna do this and that oh wait DID HE EVEN BOTHER TO ASK CONGRESS. If y’all only knew my prediction for what’s coming y’all all might want to break out your Bible and ask god to intervene now before it’s gets out of hand.

Are you shocked yet?  Well you shouldn’t be since  Joe Biden is an enemy of life, period. While Biden once held to some semblance of coherency on the life issue, he has since fully sold his soul to the Democratic Party’s War on the Helpless Unborn Baby. Biden’s shamelessness is not only out of touch with his Catholic faith and fellow Catholics, it’s also far outside the mainstream of American public opinion. According to a newly-released Marist Poll, a majority of Republicans (95%), Independents (85%), and even Democrats (55%) are OPPOSED to taxpayer-funded abortion overseas. \n\nSo beyond abortion, let’s review Joe Biden’s now-completed first week in office: A record number of 37 Executive Orders in his first week as president\nWarlike military occupation of D.C. -- while our National Guard troops sleep in garages which is shameful. \nBiden Eliminated about 11,000 Keystone XL pipeline jobs (A Democrat ending union jobs!) \nBiden, Reversed a campaign promise, halting new energy exploration, risking millions of jobs\nBiden, Declared war on science, allowing men in women’s bathrooms and showers.\nBiden, Threatened all womens’ sports by allowing men to participate.\nBiden, Suspended deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes (temporarily halted by a judge).\nBiden, Beat the war drums in Iraq again. Biden, Reignited nuclear arms threats in the Middle East\nBiden, Created “study group” to scheme Court packing.\nBiden, Sided with public school unions to keep schools closed even though the CDC said they are safe. This liberal democrat/Biden agenda is uniting Americans of all races and backgrounds against the “woke” elite trying to bring about a revolution in America. \nThe good news? The elite will fail. \nMost Americans are already disgusted. Former President Trump can’t be blamed anymore.

The report has some notable information amid an array of complicated projections that may or may not come true. It claims, for instance, that “despite a brief dip in carbon dioxide emissions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still heading for a temperature rise.” \nBut for the United States, the real value in this report is as an advisory that it need not join the Paris Climate Accord. This report is evidence that, instead, the U.S. should just keep doing what it is doing to cut its own emissions. The U.S. is the most successful major country at mitigating its own pollution, and the U.N. shows this. \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenrwald/2020/12/10/the-un-makes-the-case-for-the-us-to-stay-out-of-the-paris-climate-accord/?fbclid=IwAR11Ylv6FSDrM2yRuj8cqz8HuJMT_nJyeId7EhSBDQuMx_oEBnJypA8SLEY&sh=1ceac46d27e5", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "David Paz", "channel": "UCLE2PxByGEeaj5LVbN-GK4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTvQWwzVZB0imAti-dh-JJl6JWmkiqUUYGG6g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So what you want, but he won’t. So what does that mean? There are billions of cars in the US using oil and gas, we have to get that from somewhere. Now we are going to be energy dependent on foreign countries rather than utilizing what we have here locally and in Canada. What sense does that make? Now we have to use ships that use oil to transport said oil as well when we can create jobs HERE and streamline the production and safe delivery of LOCAL oil.

Second, you need to keep the earth’s magnetosphere at a constant level.  Third, stop the earth from its ongoing increase in axial tilt which is causing the arctic circle to march northwards at almost 50 feet every year (remember, the earth’s oceans have 1,000,000 times more heat capacity than the atmosphere).  Do these, and then you have a shot.  Do them not, and nothing else matters.\r\n\r\nBetter to worry about NEOs, near earth objects. The next biggy will be close to earth in 2029.

These promises are known as “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs). \n\nDr. Lomborg’s research reveals:\n\n    The climate impact of all Paris INDC promises is minuscule: if we measure the impact of every nation fulfilling every promise by 2030, the total temperature reduction will be 0.048°C (0.086°F) by 2100.\n    Even if we assume that these promises would be extended for another 70 years, there is still little impact: if every nation fulfills every promise by 2030, and continues to fulfill these promises faithfully until the end of the century, and there is no ‘CO₂ leakage’ to non-committed nations, the entirety of the Paris promises will reduce temperature rises by just 0.17°C (0.306°F) by 2100. \n    US climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.031°C (0.057°F) by 2100.\n    EU climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.053°C (0.096°F) by 2100.\n    China climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.048°C (0.086°F) by 2100.\n    The rest of the world’s climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.036°C (0.064°F) by 2100.\n\nOverview in Celsius and Fahrenheit by the year 2100\n\nWhat does this mean for the Paris Summit?\n\nDr. Lomborg said: “Paris is being sold as the summit where we can help ‘heal the planet’ and ‘save the world’. It is no such thing. If all nations keep all their promises, temperatures will be cut by just 0.05°C (0.09°F). Even if every government on the planet not only keeps every Paris promise, reduces all emissions by 2030, and shifts no emissions to other countries, but also keeps these emission reductions throughout the rest of the century, temperatures will be reduced by just 0.17°C (0.3°F) by the year 2100. \n\nAnd let’s be clear, that is very optimistic. Consider the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, never ratified by the US, and eventually abandoned by Canada and Russia and Japan. After several renegotiations, the Kyoto Protocol had been weakened to the point that the hot air left from the collapse of the Soviet Union exceeded the entire promised reductions, leaving the treaty essentially toothless. \n\nThe only reason Kyoto goals were almost achieved was the global 2008 recession.  Moreover, emissions were shifted from one country to another. The EU, the most climate-engaged bloc, saw an increase in its emission imports from China alone equaling its entire domestic CO₂ reductions. In total, 40% of all emissions were likely shifted away from the areas that made promises.\n\nNegotiators in Paris are trying to tackle global warming in the same way that has failed for 30 years: by making promises that are individually expensive, will have little impact even in a hundred years and that many governments will try to shirk from. \n\nThis didn’t work in Kyoto, it didn’t work in Copenhagen, it hasn’t worked in the 18 other climate conferences or countless more international gatherings. The suggestion that it will make a large difference in Paris is wishful thinking.”\n\nWhat should countries do instead?\n\nDr. Lomborg said: “Instead of trying to make fossil fuels so expensive that no one wants them – which will never work – we should make green energy so cheap everybody will shift to it.\n\nThe Copenhagen Consensus on Climate project gathered 27 of the world’s top climate economists and three Nobel Laureates, who found that the smartest, long-term climate policy is to invest in green R&D, to push down the price of green energy. \n\nSubsidizing inefficient renewables is expensive and doesn’t work. The IEA estimates that we get 0.4% of our energy from wind and solar PV right now, and even in optimistic scenarios the fraction will only rise to 2.2% by 2040. Over the next 25 years, we’ll spend about $2.5 trillion in subsidies and reduce global warming temperatures by less than 0.02°C. \n\nCopenhagen Consensus has consistently argued for a R&D-driven approach. Fortunately, more people are recognizing that this approach is cheaper and much more likely to succeed –including the Global Apollo Program which includes Sir David King, Lord Nicholas Stern, Lord Adair Turner and Lord John Browne.\nYou describe a 0.05°C reduction, but the UN Climate Chief, Christina Figueres, said Paris could lead to a 2.7°C rise instead of 4°C or 5°C. Why?\n\nChristiana Figueres quote: “The INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four, five, or more degrees of warming projected by many prior to the INDCs.” \n\nDr. Lomborg said: “That entirely misrepresents the world’s options. The 2.7°C comes from the International Energy Agency and essentially assumes that if governments do little in Paris and then right after 2030 embark on incredibly ambitious climate reductions, we could get to 2.7°C. \n\nThat way of thinking is similar to telling the deeply indebted Greeks that just making the first repayment on their most pressing loans will put them on an easy pathway to becoming debt-free. It completely misses the point. \n\nFigueres’ own organization estimates the Paris promises will reduce emissions by 33Gt CO₂ in total. To limit rises to 2.7°C, about 3,000Gt CO₂ would need to be reduced – or about 100 times more than the Paris commitments (see figure below). That is not optimism; it is wishful thinking.\nhttp://www.lomborg.com/press-release-research-reveals-negligible-impact-of-paris-climate-promises", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Sasquatch", "channel": "UCLwF3cdhi9p2NfuFvOb-kaQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQjA-0-WbEJvHH85u56HC3NtlCQ0LXP4HPHQymp=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You mentioned the Ark. The Bible says there was a dew that watered the earth. The ice caps did not exist during the days of Noah. I can prove it with the P-38 lightning’s they found 130’ under the ice. The ice layers are not years, they are daily storm events. The ice melts and that water goes into the atmosphere just like during Noah’s time. Imagine no need for irrigation, same temp year round, no A/C, no heater, food grows year round, no weeds because the grass choked them out. No starvation and the added weight to the atmosphere turns earth into a giant hyperbaric chamber. Do you know anything about the Heath benefits of being in a hyperbaric chamber? You mentioned a biblical scenario with the Ark. now I’m going to tell you one. In revelations it’s says that Lucifer is captured and thrown into a bottomless pit and then Jesus makes a new heaven and a new earth. Friend, He’s going to return it to its natural state as it was before the fall of man. A garden of Eden, a tropical paradise for you and me. Bovine flatulence and your lawnmower has absolutely nothing to do with global warming. It’s much bigger than that and I don’t have the time to explain it but I can quickly mention the amount of heat coming out from the bottom of the ocean at the pacific ring of fire.

I think what you struggle with is the hypocrisy and rightfully so. It stinks to high heaven. The stench is so bad that someday there will be an abrupt adjustment. Let me explain:\n\nThe concept of not being a Christian unless you’re a registered Republican is absurd. The exact opposite is true.\nLet’s talk about Jesus for just a moment. He never hurt anyone. Gave of himself until it killed Him. True? Thomas there was a man named Jesus and He did badly insult religious leaders and started a movement. He was homeless and slept on the ground. Today’s church is the exact opposite, for the most part. Jesus kept turning people away and to go home. A pastor wants people to come and stay. Jesus told people to give their money to the poor. Pastors say give it to me and if there’s anything left it will go to the poor. Jesus said do not swear an oath but all politicians do. Thomas, if a Christian is someone who does what Jesus says, if you do the opposite then you are something entirely different aren’t you? It gets worse, they place their hand on a Bible and do the exact thing Jesus said to not do. Then comes the evangelical Christian and votes for them. They just became a participant in that sin. I believe it is absolutely impossible for a politician to be a Christian. Those who vote and claim salvation are in error.\nBut there was a man named Jesus and He said Whosoever will call on my name will be saved. Unfortunately that’s as far as it goes with most people. I’m going to let you in an a little secret. I’m going to explain something to you that is a paradox. It’s the easiest thing you will ever do but at the same time it’s the hardest. You ask how is that possible? It’s a paradox and it’s both and what I’m telling you is true. If I said it was easy and only easy, you being of the character that you are Thomas you would not believe me. Likewise if I say it’s so hard that you can never achieve it you would also not believe. But this is the secret. \nSalvation and every sense of this word is as simple as saying “thank you.” A man who never hurt anyone once said “the Lord inhabitants the praises of His people.” Stay with me ok! Thomas, this means that if you give God praise, He will automatically come to you. He will inhabit you and dwell within you. It’s that simple. Thank you. BUT. I promise you there will come a day when it will take everything within you to mutter two little words, thus the test. Most if not all Christians fail and their supposed to. But do they get back on their feet and acknowledge their faults or do they pick up a Bible and act righteous and beat people with it. It’s usually the latter isn’t it Thomas. Man is corrupt and he will always destroy all that he touches including god. When you eat chicken do you eat the feathers? How about the entrails? Legs? Of course not right. Churches are full of dead men’s bones and there’s a whole slew of folks just waiting for a baby Christian to show up with a brand new Bible just itchin to open his mouth and cram it full of bones. \nThe closer we get to the end the worse it gets but be of good cheer because Jesus said I will never leave you nor forsake you. But He also said if you abide in me I will abide in you.

Even the king of Israel knew it and had all the first born 2 and under executed. It was Isaiah that told them way in advance of His coming. The thing is, everyone and I mean everyone was expecting a conqueror, a king! Not some homeless guy from Nazareth. But, He was the one who fulfilled everything Isaiah said. When Jesus died, Lucifer fell from power. We can argue about the existence of Jesus until the cows come home but to deny the existence of Lucifer is different because even the Satanist believe in Jesus. Bible says even the demons believe and tremble. But Lucifer was kinda tricked into it. Lucifer being the extreme narcissist that he is is not going to listen to anyone or anything but that which satisfies his ravenous lust for power. When Christ died, it turned the world upside down. Judas went and hung him self and Nero light Rome on fire and played his fiddle while he watched it burn. Hundreds of thousands of people all became believers and thousands more got in line to be slaughtered because of their faith in Christ. Bible didn’t exist. Only the Old Testament that was kept locked in synagogues. But the people knew that He was the one. To disagree with a man who never hurt anyone because you disagree with a book is fairly peculiar to say the least. Kinda like throwing the baby out with the bath water don’t you think? By the way, who named you Thomas? You do know where that name comes from right? A Jewish fisherman perhaps? One that doubted. Refused to believe unless he could place his hand inside Jesus’s body through the wound in his side. Thomas puts his hand inside the wound and says “My Lord and my God.” Right soon after this happened it wasn’t long and we as a people were thrusted into the dark ages and the religious elite murdered millions of people who refused to deny Jesus as lord. Kinda odd don’t you think Thomas? The most powerful Christian organization in the world murdering Christians for their faith. Then also murdered Christians just for having a Bible. Murdered Christians just because they had read a Bible. Murdered people just because they thought you might have been exposed to a Bible. They murdered people just because they could. Foxes book of martyrs talks all about it. Bible does a little bit. Once again, if the Bible didn’t have any power then it wouldn’t matter. Wouldn’t matter who has one or who reads it. It’s like if I say oh Buddha! HA HA yeah that’s funny or praise you Ghandi! Yeah yeah that’s a good one. But if I say thank you Jesus! Cricket’s......\nSilence and scorn. Go to work and start saying every so often “thank you Jesus” and see what happens. Promotion? I know, hot date. Better yet, how about a big party in your favor. How about the door instead. Labeled a kook and rejected by all your peers and relentlessly mocked. Put on a Ghandi T-shirt and see if you get the same results. If Jesus doesn’t have any power than why on earth is he so badly hated. A man who did nothing to hurt anyone is the most hated person to have ever existed.

{"cid": "UgzLhnzI1Kb2hDzTtnB4AaABAg", "text": "Greatest hoax in modern times. A scientifically illiterate mainstream media almost always misinterprets or abuses science due to a biased global agenda. In a survey cited by Snopes...only 1 percent of scientists trusted mainstream media to accurately report their scientific results. The general populace suffers from a form of mathematical deprivation in terms of relative proportions, as well as, an extreme dearth in updates in science that challenge the current popular consensus of the globalists. This disinformation and misinformation is, of course, assisted by the profit and agenda-driven mass media, and the unfortunate reality that this yellow journalism is actually used as a primary form of education by so many liberal thinkers. According to Quora, humans make up about one 17 trillionth of the Earth’s mass (a single flea on a solid filled basketball would have far more relative mass than all the humans on earth). If earth and people were reduced to the size of this basketball, you would not be able to see the people with the most powerful microscope...because a person would be smaller than even a subatomic particle such as a proton. With controlled media presentations...the globalists have perpetuated a big lie.\n\nThe entire population of the earth (a mere 7 billion) could all stand in Los Angeles (5 hundred square miles), far far less than a single percentage point of the earth’s surface area...which is 57,308,738 square miles (57 million). More recent studies show that volcanoes (even inactive ones), plate tectonics, and other surface phenomena, are much more vast producers of CO2 than previously thought, and that the isotopic footprint of man-made C02 production is easily confused with natural production...because they are the same. What is the real impact of humans on climate change? Essentially none. Geological, meteorological, and cosmological events, far far outweigh any human impacts. Anyone can claim this is not true...yet this is the science of the numbers and the proportions. This is not to say that our pollution doesn’t impact other humans, plants and animals in the affected polluted regions (and that’s not good)...however, this relatively miniscule source of pollution has no significant effect on climate change. Climate will change whether we like it or not.\n\nLike the Ozone layer hoax which proved seasonal and cyclical, sensational alarmism is used to affect a global agenda and nothing more. That the coral regions of the earth’s oceans, such as the great barrier reef, are disappearing is also a myth generated by the false reporting of science (Humans have less than 1 percent impact on the natural process of coral bleaching). As well, humans use up none of the Earth’s 6 quintillion gallons of water. That is because water recycles into the earth’s enclosed ecosystems...just like CO2. Media loves to use cool science fiction art depicting all sorts of out-of-proportion disasters in the news. However, Is a nuclear blast on earth visible from the moon? No...at best you could see a very tiny reflection from its cloud dust if sun rays were to hit and a reflection were to occur. Basically a thermonuclear blast will kill living organisms in the vicinity surrounding the blast range and leave radioactivity. That’s not good for us humans...but the impact to the earth itself is again...negligible. People generally have no idea of relative proportions regarding a number of natural events. Popular science and internet media search algorithms do as little as possible to represent it clearly and accurately to the public...because they fear their agenda might be discovered for its real motive and then ignored. \n\nSo...why is this abuse of science done? In the words of H. L. Mencken…”The urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule.” Yet the poison pill of socialism is of far far greater concern to human life then global warming will ever be. When a very direct and precise question is entered in current Big Tech controlled search engines, rather than getting a direct response they figure might lead to further “distracting” questions...detracting from their global agenda...they instead give only the answers to the questions they want you to ask. Try it...it happens all the time...especially with “hot button” topics. The impacts of oil spills, while impacting surrounding marine life (and no one is saying its not important and a terrible thing) has nil effect on the earth itself. All of fracking is less than a single pin prick on that basketball sized globe. The likelihood it would trigger anything different from the usual course of plate tectonics is so tiny as to be zero.

You see carbon isn't bad for the environment, in fact it's great for plants. Plants love carbon co2 it's why the jurrasic period was so lush because of all the volcanos emitting carbon into the air that the plants where feeding on. \n\nAnd it's quite ironic how the oil this carbon is derived from are the dead biological material from that same period in the past! We are throwing carbon into the atmosphere that originated from a time during the most plant growth BECAUSE OF CARBON! It's so amazing isn't it?\n\nWe have all been sold a lie that carbon is bad. It's not! While unregulated dirty carbon is bad becaus it contains mercury and other heavy metals, the regulated CLEAN carbon the united states produces is not bad. It's good for plants. \n\nPeople are shocked to even fathom that such a vast lie could be told but they fail to understand there is much more control and money to be had by taxing carbon than producing it, by regulating carbon you regulate an entire countries economy, it's energy, it's blood... \n\nClimate change is a lie that perverts science to make a whole lot of people over seas more rich and powerful. Because if you can control the united states energy, you basically can control the united states... It's not a difficult concept to understand but it's apparent when it's greedy cut throat politicians moving this agenda forward. Big global banking apparatuses moving it along.\n\nThey don't care about you. They want this countries successes and they want it bad.

By stopping the keystone pipeline  and exploration, he is transferring dependence of oil products to the middle east.  fuel prices are set by the middle east.   Canada has a large source that the keystone project would transport.  this project has been vetted by obama's and trump's administrations.  Until the green plan starts replacing (which will take years)  the reliance on middle east oil, why is american money sent to the middle east and not kept in north america.  \n here is a simple question.  Who of his donors is directly tied to the large oil companies profiting in the middle east.  Do these companies benefit by cutting the keystone project.   I have not seen any review for the pros and cons of his decisions.  just because he is  not trump, the news media must still protect the interest of everyday americans by holding the government accountable.

Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry\r\n16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house\r\n18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry.\r\n21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey.\r\nThese two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production.\r\n\nBy the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production of  oil and gas. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions  \n\nJoe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor.  The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption.  Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month.  Biden had no oil and gas experience.\r\nThen an email shows that Burisma thanked Hunter for this.  This guy has no plan to build the country.

They were mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and colleagues who leave behind grieving loved ones and a nation on edge. \n\nFor the past year, we could not turn to the federal government for a national plan to answer prayers with action — until today. In the following pages, you will find my Administration’s national strategy to beat the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a comprehensive plan that starts with restoring public trust and mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign. It continues with the steps we know that stop the spread liked expanded masking, testing, and social distancing. It’s a plan where the federal government works with states, cities, Tribal communities, and private industry to increase supply and administer testing and the vaccines that will help reopen schools and businesses safely. Equity will also be central to our strategy so that the communities and people being disproportionately infected and killed by\n\nthe pandemic receive the care they need and deserve.\n\n\r\nOur national strategy will be driven by scientists and public health experts who will regularly speak directly to you, free\r from political interference as they make decisions strictly on science and public health alone. \n\nAbove all, Vice President Harris and I, and our entire Administration, will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news and the bad. The honest truth is we are still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It will get worse before it gets better. Progress will take time to measure as people getting infected today don’t show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. Even as we make progress, we will face setbacks. But I know we can do it, and that a true national strategy will take all of us working together. It will take Congress providing the necessary funding. Families and neighbors will need to continue looking out for one another. We will need health care providers, businesses, civic, religious and civil rights organizations, and unions all rallying together in common purpose and with urgency, purpose, and resolve. We will need to reassert America’s leadership in the world in the fight against this and future public health threats.\n\nThere are moments in history when more is asked of us as Americans. We are in that moment now and history will measure whether we were up to a task. Beating this pandemic will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever faced as a nation. I believe we are ready, as fellow Americans and as the United States of America.\n\nMay God bless the lost souls of this pandemic, and all of you on the frontlines who define the best of who we are as\r\nAmericans.\n\n\r\nSincerely,\r President Joe Biden\" \n\nSounds very Presidential and honorable to me", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Mikael Leon Briones", "channel": "UCkvEXFIm_1DmJ5J5PQjna3Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRQNPv0iGcnlZQGl9hF4Q1d9hg2WRW4tCcW6pYH=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is the 1st step in cleaning up the incredible and mind numbing mistakes and damage the trump crime administration has done.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Jack Snackson", "channel": "UC0qLK4yRTfHzplU8i7Yispw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRA12CoOzmD2-HFG57BizETDIX5aqJNYGX2g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In regards to investments, research, and practical application China is leading the way. You fail to realize that there is a difference in scaled operation. China is leading the way in regards to the end consumer and small town level of application.  Its a damn shame that we Americans dropped the ball on that opportunity.  The second concept that you have failed to understand is the net goal. Sure they are building coal plants, but that will be offset by green buildings, transportation, and appliances. Thankfully President Joe Biden has shown true leadership and has signed an executive order to remedy the previous administration's absolute failure and ignorance.  Lastly you fail to understand that the goal is not to completely eliminate certain energy, but instead to reduce the dependency.  There is a finite amount of fossil fuel and if we can reduce the use and burden incrementally by year we can get to the point to offset the negative of fossil fuels while creating renewable energy. This all takes wisdom, talent, and hard workers. Again President Joe Biden is making a smart move by focusing on JOB creating industries vs dying industries where the labor has been replaced by machines. Don't worry things are going to get much better for all of us, even if republicans can't understand it.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Jack Snackson", "channel": "UC0qLK4yRTfHzplU8i7Yispw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQRA12CoOzmD2-HFG57BizETDIX5aqJNYGX2g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugz55-RKVyLfHn2uQIN4AaABAg.9J1pcR2HnGN9J4c0ko-Kj0", "text": " @AdamKey   \nAfter reading all this back and forth about who’s the biggest polluter, I’d like to help.  When I hear people proclaiming the “use of science”, I think it would be fair to ask them to use facts or at least “their facts along with the source of such “facts”.  \nEverybody must have heard that “figures cannot lie, but liars can figure”. Let’s see.\nWith reference to the link below (whose truthfulness I cannot verify, but let’s say it is making an effort not to skew the data),\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/39548763\n \nIt says the following:\n1. China\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 9,838.8 million metric tons\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 7.1 metric tons\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 270.3%\n\n2. USA\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 5,269.5 million metric tons\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.2 metric tons\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 1.8%\n\nFrom a couple of websites, whose truthfulness I am not questioning, we find:\nChina’s pop. 1992: 1,165 billions\nChina’s pop. 2017: 1,386 billions\nChina % pop. incr. since 1992= 19%\n\nUSA pop. 1992: 256.51 millions\nUSA Pop. 2017: 324.99 millions\nUSA % pop. incr. since 1992= 27%\n\nSo China is the largest pollution producer (9,838.8 million metric tons) vs. USA (5,269.5 million metric tons), ALMOST 2X.\nHowever when you divide the total pollution produced, by the respective populations, then The US produces 16.2 metric tons per person, vs.  China at 7.1 metric tons per person. \nLooking at the Pollution Production increase for each country, it is 270.3% China to 1.8% USA. A huge difference. \nComparing the respective population changes during the same time period, it’s 27% USA vs. 19% China. \nSo for that given time frame even though the USA Population vs. China’s grew by a higher percentage (27% to 19%) the pollution production per capita, by China grew by a 150X factor vs. that of the USA. Amazing! Is it not?\nAnother thing the pollution production increase numbers tell me is that using the per capita calculation is not indicative of shit. The total pollution must be broken down into its largest producers. Blaming the average Joe and saddling him/her with causing all this “average” pollution, is totally  bullshit and unfair to Joe. I would be comfortable saying  that most pollution is probably generated by the manufacturing sector. \nSo from the above analysis (mine), I think it would be fair to say that China ABSOLUTELY generates around TWICE the pollution the US generates.\nThat is science (maybe?)😀", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Pasquale Difazio", "channel": "UCqG4KRm_zQT-6fBiFVQCn-w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRH-YmbaEU56QZhHzFT3L-WB1Ogbi7P5ZyHlg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Trump supported white supremacy by expressing a belief in & support for the white supremacist `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS` that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, that he is a Muslim, etc. He gleefully accepted a leadership role in these white supremacist `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS` even though they had long-since been disproven years earlier. He supported white supremacy by retweeting white supremacist tweets containing white supremacist `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS`, such as `birther-gate`, etc. He supported white supremacy by supporting the (neo-)Confederate Flag, being against the removal of Confederate statues and by being against the renaming of military bases named after Confederate soldiers. He also catered to white supremacy with trying to carry through on his FAKE promises about a wall on the US-Mexico border, a white supremacist utopian horror `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrY`. And he told `the Proud Boys`. (WTF do they have to be `proud` of?!) \n\nNice FAIL.

Rather than relying heavily on foreign oil. Fracking was already a thing before the push towards renewable energy. Natural gas has also heavily reduced our dependency on coal. Which isn't clean, but it's definitely cleaner than coal. You can't just replace an entire industry without having it's replacement in place, otherwise their will be devastating consequences. That's why Biden is trying to push heavily into renewables so that fracking can be reduced over time and eventually phased out completely. Just as we have done with coal over the last 50 years.\n\nIt's not a detour because we are already doing it. It's a means to the end. Coal usage has already dropped, but renewable only makes up like 20% of our energy right now. The majority of it comes from oil, gas, and coal. 80 years ago, coal was the largest producer of energy. Today it makes up less than 15%. 20 years ago, it made up almost 25%. The transition period always takes a long time.\n\nHad the US started heavily investing in renewables, especially solar and wind, 20 years ago, instead of constantly propping up the fossil fuel energy sector, we would have been a lot further along. And China wouldn't be the leader in that regard.\n\nSo it what world do you suddenly expect fracking to suddenly end? What will replace our energy needs? Common sense dictates that we need to have a replacement in order to shut down fracking. As more renewables come on line, as more appliances convert to electric instead of gas, as more cars become more efficient and transition into fully electric, etc. the need for oil and fracking will go down. If it were feasible to shut it down right now, Biden probably would try. But again, common sense dictates that would literally cripple us. What do you expect to fill the 30-40% gap in energy that would come from cutting off fracking right now?\n\nEvery one that believe that climate change is real, and takes it seriously knows that we need to start doing something and get the ball rolling, and that we should have started a long time ago.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Ryan Takahashi", "channel": "UCXqd3SddrcwF-lGa598doLQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTHPsLcJEVbyX-zUQKX1fR8NOba6tsOX78hjA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production.\r\n\nBy the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions\n\nJoe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor.  The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption.  Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month.

I've heard this excuse before:  \"Why should I question what I'm told when it takes SO much trouble to do so?\"  Fine, don't question.  Don't listen to CNN.  Doesn't matter to me what you believe.  But when you start preaching this opinion based hogwash as truth, that's when it gets to be a problem.  \n\nLet me say this once again:  Over the past four plus years I've watched EVERY single irritating, obnoxious, rambling, incoherent speech trump has ever made.  I've sat through his rantings and name calling and cutesy bullying.  I've also watched Fox and Oann and Newsmax (granted, I couldn't take much of this, especially Hannity and Jeanine Shapiro and Greg Gutfed, but I did try).  I do like Chris Wallace, the last man with integrity at Fox).  \n\nI've been able to see through them right away ... and not because I'm special but because they're obvious.  Newsmax and Oann are just poor journalists, often making grammar errors and mispronouncing names.  I've watched their \"reporters\" ask trump questions while he was still doing press briefings (which was laughable).  These \"questions\" were veiled praise that a three year old could see through, but trump lapped it up.  \n\nI watched Stephanie Myers of Oann, dressed to the nines, ask trump something that sounded like, \"Why is it that everyone is so jealous of how amazing you are?\"  Gag!  And these are the people you believe know what they're talking about.  \n\nI would wager that you had very little interest in politics prior to Obama and that you became really engaged when your boy trump took office.  Then, I would also wager, that it wasn't a matter of politics, but a matter of \"team spirit\" ... a personality contest.  This is how cults form.  Mostly when you aren't paying attention but digging in because of your team.  And as you're not noticing what you're actually doing, you're taking the entire Republican party (that used to be respected and honorable) and turning it into some sort of mud wrestling team that you're cheering on regardless of what they're doing.\n\nAnd in the meantime, almost 550,000 people have died, we've become the laughing stock of the world, our foreign relations is in shambles, and the worst aspects of who we are as Americans are held up as some sort of badge of honor.  \n\nYou have no idea what's going on in the country or where we'd be now if trump did win another term.

Also, unlike oil, natural gas is a renewable energy source and with strict guidelines in place for the oil industry how is that going to affect your breathing? Biden is set to destroy 16 million jobs in the oil sector without anything in place to remedy that. Additionally, the last 4 yrs we were once free from dependence on foreign oil which gave us very low gas prices which we all enjoyed.

Even IF the stormy daniels thing was true and settlements are not always an admission of guilt.  Companies often settle to get rid of bad (true or false) publicity  How would that affect the average citizen compared to the corrupt theft of billions?\n\nBear with me on this.  \nBiden ran on a ticket of closing down the US oil industry (he said he would ban fracking and phase out oil) while he and his son have interests in foreign oil companies in Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan. They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern\r\nEarly 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry\r\n16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house\r\n18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry.\r\n21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey.\r\nThese two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production.\r\n\nBy the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the bidems and his buddies are worried about carbon emissions\n\nJoe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor.  The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption.  Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month.  Biden had no oil and gas experience.\r\nThen an email shows that Burisma thanked Hunter for this. \n\nMy only worry is that the FBI have had this laptop for more than a year now and after a year the famed FBI said that they still investigating and that the emails are not a Russian hacking campaign.  Either the emails are true and someone will have info on the bidens and the truth is being kept from us or they are false or the FBI do not know what to do (and I think they know how to investigate authenticity of emails)?

What pray tell gives you the idea that I would have supported the nazis.  People keep saying that Trump is a white supremacists but his actions really do not lend credence to that.  Read below and let me know if these are the actions of white supremacist. \n\nIn 2018, President Trump signed the groundbreaking First Step Act, a criminal justice bill which enacted reforms that make our justice system fairer and help former inmates successfully return to society.\r\n\nThe First Step Act’s reforms addressed inequities in sentencing laws that disproportionately harmed Black Americans and reformed mandatory minimums that created unfair outcomes.\r\nThe First Step Act expanded judicial discretion in sentencing of non-violent crimes.\r\n\nOver 90% of those benefiting from the retroactive sentencing reductions in the First Step Act are Black Americans.\n\nThe First Step Act provides rehabilitative programs to inmates, helping them successfully rejoin society and not return to crime.\r\n\nTrump increased funding for historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by more than 14%.\r\n\nTrump signed legislation forgiving Hurricane Katrina debt that threatened HBCUs.\r\n\nNew single-family home sales are up 31.6% in October 2019 compared to just one year ago.\r\n\nMade HBCUs a priority by creating the position of executive director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs.\r\n\n Trump received the Bipartisan Justice Award at a historically black college for his criminal justice reform accomplishments.\n\nIn January 2020 The poverty rate fell to a 17-year low of 11.8% under the Trump administration as a result of a jobs-rich environment and Poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans have reached their lowest levels since the U.S. began collecting such data.\n\nThe Trump Administration is promoting second chance hiring to give former inmates the opportunity to live crime-free lives and find meaningful employment.\r\nTrump’s DOJ and the Board Of Prisons launched a new “Ready to Work Initiative” to help connect employers directly with former prisoners.\r\nPresident Trump’s historic tax cut legislation included new Opportunity Zone Incentives to promote investment in low-income communities across the country.\r\n8,764 communities across the country have been designated as Opportunity Zones.\n\nTrump signed three bills to benefit Native people. One gives compensation to the Spokane tribe for loss of their lands in the mid-1900s, one funds Native language programs, and the third gives federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Montana.\n\nTrump signed a bill to require airports to provide spaces for breastfeeding moms.\n\nIn the eight years prior to President Trump’s inauguration, prescription drug prices increased by an average of 3.6% per year. Under Trump, drug prices have seen year-over-year declines in nine of the last ten months\n\nTrump appointed five openly gay ambassadors.\r\nTrump ordered Ric Grenell, his openly gay ambassador to Germany, to lead a global initiative to decriminalize homosexuality across the globe.\n\nThrough Trump’s Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) initiative, Federal law enforcement more than doubled convictions of human traffickers and increased the number of defendants charged by 75% in ACTeam districts.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Peter O", "channel": "UC3Q9oc48UJYwXv3WLsLAimw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkDe2RJGJcW6kp6e_yyTRTqL2ChGchooCR_Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is far from looking at the merits of the matter.  \n\nThe CIA and FBI do lie.  They even admit it.  \n\nIts the antifa types that have a hold on AOC +++  also known as the squad.  NOt the other way round.  They fickle.  The youth are not all as dumb as you think and do not all fall hook line and sinker for the leftists and communists.  When white people are TEN times more likely to be killed by a black person than vice versa and TWELVE times more likely to be robbed by a black person then trust me they not all antifa and burn loot and murder supporters.  The vote was stolen and you know it.  There is ample evidence of this, didnt you watch the news of how Republican election observers were kicked out and stopped from working.  Did you not hear the eyewitness testimony of boxes of unfolded mail in ballots being brought in.  A court ordered audit of Dominion voting machines used in Michigan concluded that the systems are designed to perpetuate election fraud, supporting President Donald Trump’s claims of irregularities. State officials have criticized the report.\r\nThe court-ordered forensic audit, carried out by Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), found that Dominion systems in Antrim County, Michigan recorded a shocking 68 percent error rate while tabulating votes. The report noted that the faulty software far exceeds the “allowable election error rate” of 0.0008 percent set by the Federal Election Commission. \n\nDont fall for the media.   “The media’s the most powerful entity on Earth.

There are still 3 election fra..d court cases pending and I hope they actually test the evidence and clear things up either way.  \n\nVoter fra..d is more common than we think\nHere is a website that lists all the convictions  of voter fra..d https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud\n\nThe mass mail in voting, no signature verification and voting without ID etc would not be used in a third world country because they know how easy it is to rig and they have been rigged in the past.  In South Africa for eg there is no mail in voting at all.  In Britain you have to request it and with reason and even then there are safe guards.  The safe guards were removed by the dems and the US elections really looked more like something from Zimbabwe.\nI am not against all democrat leaders.  Tulsi Gubbard and even Bernie Sanders would be better than biden and Harris.  Sanders although sometimes misguided is a man of his word.  Gubbard would have made a great president.  I do not agree with everything they say but they are reasonable people.\n\nThe odd thing is that in 2020 Trump got more votes than in 2016 and he got a highest percentage of the black vote for a Republican since the 1960s.

ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey.\r\nThese two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production.\r\n\nBy the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions.  \n\nJoe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor.  The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption.  Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month.

Yes, CO2 is not a dominant gas in the atmosphere, but even slight increases have a detrimental impact on Earth's ecology. Climate changes over hundreds of thousands of years, even millions of years, but the issue today is that climate is changing at a rapid speed because of human activities. We see the consequences every year, record heat waves, record storms, record sea-level rise, record fires, record ocean acidification, record extinction, record drought, etc. The change is so rapid that nature and humans are unable to adapt. Imagine the refugee and water crisis of the future. We could barely handle 100 thousand Syrian refugees imagine hundreds of millions as a result of climate degradation. Transitioning our energy sector requires thinking locally, using renewable technology on a small scale, microgrids, installing solar panels on every house so they become self-sufficient. No one is saying eliminate oil, we understand that oil is essential for petroleum products like plastic. What we are saying is to change the way we power our cities, and change the way we transport our goods and people. Transforming our sources of electricity, and eliminating the combustion engine is how we will solve this crisis.

One, water vapour sits low in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 goes up as high as 50km. This higher altitude makes CO2 much more prominent in absorbing infrared radiation. Secondly, and much more importantly, water vapor does not control the Earth’s temperature, but is instead controlled by the temperature.  The amount of water molecules on the planet don't change.

Electricity is primarily generated by fossil fuels. Solar/Wind is inefficient as a primary source but also has a major impact on the environment by way of killing wildlife and destroying habitats. Also the pollution and land erosion from the manufacture of solar panels/wind turbines. Looking deeper into the background of this president, his family members and associates tells me this is a push to shut down oil resources in North America in order to create demand from the interests overseas. Looking deeper into this all I see is a tax and no solution. Normally anyone with 1/4 of a brain would find a solution on energy production that can exceed the current demand before destroying an industry and creating an economic crisis. Safer nuclear power plants would currently be the only solution that can exceed what is generated by fossil fuels. I am also willing to bet that our current president and his cronies have generated a much larger carbon footprint than the majority of the U.S. citizens. I find that hypocritical.

They were mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and colleagues who leave behind grieving loved ones and a nation on edge.\n\nFor the past year, we could not turn to the federal government for a national plan to answer prayers with action — until today. In the following pages, you will find my Administration’s national strategy to beat the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a comprehensive plan that starts with restoring public trust and mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign. It continues with the steps we know that stop the spread liked expanded masking, testing, and social distancing. It’s a plan where the federal government works with states, cities, Tribal communities, and private industry to increase supply and administer testing and the vaccines that will help reopen schools and businesses safely. Equity will also be central to our strategy so that the communities and people being disproportionately infected and killed by the pandemic receive the care they need and deserve.\n\nOur national strategy will be driven by scientists and public health experts who will regularly speak directly to you, free\r from political interference as they make decisions strictly on science and public health alone. \n\nAbove all, Vice President Harris and I, and our entire Administration, will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news and the bad. The honest truth is we are still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It will get worse before it gets better. Progress will take time to measure as people getting infected today don’t show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. Even as we make progress, we will face setbacks. But I know we can do it, and that a true national strategy will take all of us working together. It will take\r Congress providing the necessary funding. Families and neighbors will need to continue looking out for one another. We will need health care providers, businesses, civic, religious and civil rights organizations, and unions all rallying together in common purpose and with urgency, purpose, and resolve. We will need to reassert America’s leadership in the world in the fight against this and future public health threats. \n\nThere are moments in history when more is asked of us as Americans. We are in that moment now and history will measure whether we were up to a task. Beating this pandemic will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever faced as a nation. I believe we are ready, as fellow Americans and as the United States of America.\n\nMay God bless the lost souls of this pandemic, and all of you on the frontlines who define the best of who we are as\r Americans.\n\nSincerely and respectfully, President Joseph R. Biden\"\n\nThis screams leadership, kindness, strength, good policy and good leadership, this is a trustworthy man, this man is a leader, a man born to be a servant of the his people, and that is what he is, God Bless our President Joe Biden, join me in my best wishes for this great President because I know you are a smart woman, and you know how to pick the right leader, well this is it, have a good night.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Mikael Leon Briones", "channel": "UCkvEXFIm_1DmJ5J5PQjna3Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRQNPv0iGcnlZQGl9hF4Q1d9hg2WRW4tCcW6pYH=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I remember the days driving through Toronto Canada, and one almost had to cover the face with a cloth because of the horrible smell of sulphur and other chemicals as one passed through the city on the 401 express highway and sighing relief after you got out of the city into the country side.  Today you could almost bottle the beautiful air and sell it .  Politicians seem to use climate change to make it look like they are doing something special.  As a teenager living in the northern part of Canada, my summer job was fighting forest fires for a little extra money.  It was great money I think about fifty five cents an hour.  Northern Ontario has thousands of miles of nothing but lakes and bush as far as the eye can see, but you know what?  Those hundreds of fires a summer were mostly caused by lightning.  Yes a few by American tourists, (tongue in cheek, but hey we loved the money that came into the area, just a little joke).  Nature is the main cause of our forest fires.  Forest fires have been happening since the beginning of time. It is natures way of actually cleansing the earth. The ash etc. as fertilizer and the new growth etc.  To see the results after a few years is amazing.  Politics today in the USA seems to be like a raging forest fire.  People trying to destroy each other verbally.  Looking south, from up here, I think the USA needs a third party.  With only two parties and the news media on one side or the other, using you past president Trump as an example, the media can hound a person half to death as we have witnessed.  This is not good for your country.  More parties to vote for can eliminate most of this as now the news wants to promote which party is the best for the people, and mostly show the good points of each party.  They say there may have been cheating going on but if it doesn't get to court who really knows for sure, but from up here watching the hate for each other and the badmouthing is starting to hurt our feelings because this is exactly what Communist China wants to happen.  They want the USA destroyed from the inside out and it seems to be working right now.  Canadians have always had your back and you ours.  I am sorry to rant like this, but if in some little way, it can change thinking then good for us both.  God bless our good old friends to the south.

Currently the best we have is a lithium battery. Lithium batteries have been around since the 80's. Lithium batteries have lots of toxic heavy metals in them. They require huge amounts of energy to mine and   build.  Generally automotive batteries are warranted around 10 years but that is somewhat dependent on how they are maintained. They are also extremely expensive. Electric cars the same way they dont last very long expensive repairs and they have to be done at a stealership. With that being said I do believe that there needs to be something better than gas or diesel but battery powered vehicles is not the way. Hydrogen would be a better alternative as most internal combustion engines can run on hydrogen with minor modifications.  Hydrogen also has no negative emissions. We just need a better way to split hydrogen.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Stephen Brown", "channel": "UC5R27cAXiELf55Iguca3Nyw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS0cbJ1fQyk-dNsH3cPcF-Q02pmXF4RISmvzw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So please enlightenment how are parents and grand parents supposed to afford these cars. Don’t say credit cuz that’s only one factor of it your income has to be able to support any purchase ever made before credit is granted not to mention the people who don’t have credit to buy one. While on the subject of CREDIT what’s gonna happen to yours if u have a vehicle that no longer holds value for a dealership or a creditor to take off your hands if you are currently paying on one now.. oh I’m sure Biden’s committee are probably stringing through the comments to offset everyone’s concerns with promises that won’t be kept. So being the genius of the supporters of these great ideas please share your thoughts on these issues. You see people with money that think they have no worries are usually the ones to support ideas that are not thought out completely or no backup plans to what happens to the elderly which could end up being a loved one of yours. And as for the million jobs it’s gonna supply again that doesn’t provide income for the elderly who are retired or disabled. Oil and gas have been around for centuries and it has what kept the flow of green flowing without that flow everyone’s job is at risk and now riggers who never worked in an automobile industry won’t get that so called pay rate he speaks of because they have no experience again nothing has been thought out to completion yet in one day an executive order has been signed to begin ceasing oil and gas. Wake up people and I would say before it’s to late but it’s already to late. I can’t wait to see comments from some of these supporters when they feel the bite coming from BIDEN whom I predict won’t stay in office and it won’t be by his choice. Mark these words it’s coming all he did was sign his exit papers when he took over just watch.,... because shit is gonna get real in a very bad way in the very near future! I’m looking forward to watching all the ones who are so quick to Down put TRUMP while he was in office to even the ones for simply stating their beliefs or their opinions.

Do the math 1+1 will always equal 2 no matter how many ways you try and solve that equation. But think things through before you do things you can’t undo. Is the vehicle you drive paid for? I really don’t want to know the answer to that but if it’s not who’s gonna take that vehicle off your hands? if their are no more gas or diesel vehicles allowed or even gas stations to supply the fuel to fill up them up.. oh boy more jobs at risk hun???? Let’s just say they are allowed to continue to be driven. Where’s the gas gonna come from?!?!?! not to mention It will no longer hold a value. So evidently you don’t work in the gas or oilfield industry because if u did you wouldn’t be so quick to say YAY instead you would be wondering  how your gonna pay for a vehicle with no dollar value left to it and the so expensive one that’s all electric not to mention the roof over your head. God forbid you are fixed income and can’t afford these cars god forbid you have some other kind of job that depends on you know the money flow thing that keeps the world turning because when the oil and gas goes so does the flow of money. Oh wait silly me the million jobs created verses the 2-5 million jobs lost hmmmm... guess that’s a no brained too right?!?!? and let’s discuss one more thing all the way  through....  these jobs he’s talking about with higher pay well if all you ever did was oil and gas field or maybe just at a GAS station you really think you have a chance at a job at a factory??? better make sure you know someone or you better be at a young age cuz most men that do oilfield work have been doing this  for the most  part of their lives.. do you think employers will look at how loyal or dependable these men were on a rig that you know supplied gas for that vehicle your now complaining about having??  Or will they be looked as to old?!?!?  I mean good old Biden is pretty much talking about the young people in this video and one more thing about that factory job that will probably not be in the state you reside in what then are you willing to uproot yourself and possibly family on a whim of a chance you get that job out of the people that already reside in the state they are going to put this factory in? Boy boy boy the nerve of some to call people stupid or accuse one of wanting our country to fail.. I would be willing to bet my last bottom dollar yall didn’t think about these things either when being so degrading cuz if u did sorry but not sorry you would have made sure to state these concerns and not be so quick to put others down or holler out yay let’s do this....

Credit were all taken by paramedic after praised by the people and even promised would subdue the next outbreak but now blame the people for being useless after daily patients breached 4k per day.\n\nInshort, no one should ever justify Malaysian paramedic were better than those in Indonesia or Italy, based on new patient perday. Cos paramedic between nation have nothing different unless their equipment inview of technologies. \nIf not, you mean paramedic in Malaysia very hardworking, work very fast or very efficient when containing outbreak, compared to those in India, US and Brazil or nation that daily patient could breach 150k..\n\nCos malaysian were indeed lucky during 1st lockdown or how their highway jammed for two days, caused by hometown movement which cannot be seen in other nation. \nSure Tan Sri unaware of such event could somehow paralysed the pandemic yet should remember, how WHO and Health Ministry stand out with their prediction on when the disease would peak from mid April till end of June but ended up with 5 patients in August.\nInshort, paramedic should not taken credit without any understanding..\n\nThe question, do Tan Sri dare or not, allow malaysian went back hometown during Chinese New Year?\nYou dont want to see, how the disease paralysed. If yes, mean you need to trust the people since general knowledge about hometown movement would flare outbreak were just a theory. A theory that only happen before in Malaysia during 1st lockdown but somehow showing adverse result.\n\nCos urban and rural area have huge diferences inview of density or why disease spread easier in urban area since people living in big city were like sardine packed. And if the people allowed to move back to hometown during festival, mean they would aware why family need to go separate way, if among them someone were sick, for the mean of survival since medical centre only concentrated in urban area.\n.\nThat is the significant factor or how the disease paralysed when density of hotspot were reduced tremendously by hometown movement and indirectly causes the disease jammed, like how fire died off by itself since nothing else exist nearby so they could keep burning. Cos whoever left behind were those that already infected or how someone figured out, why Malaysia COVID19 behave so passive during 1st lockdown, compared to other countries..\nParamedic? Their efficiency in handling outbreak till causes pandemic in Malaysia behave passive, only exist in Tan Sri mindset, not those that use their sense to live their life.

Not cheap.  Huge upfront cost.  Possible fine.  Not worth it.  Not off grid.  Justin Trudeau in Canada shut down a 56 million dollar wind tower manufacturing plant and said each province had to manufacture their own wind towers.

It may well increase. That coupled with the falling price of EV ownership over the next couple of years will go a long way to accelerating change.\nBelieve it or not ... our government is now supplying EV's to local government and civil service, councils and the like.\nBy 2030 you won't be able to buy an ICE vehicle here. It won't be allowed.\n\nTesla are not only releasing the semi  this year but are designing an entry level vehicle for around $19,000. It may be in production this year. With government subsidies and attractive ownership incentives that could come down a lot further.\nLet's not forget it will also be the first model to make up a fully autonomous robo taxi fleet which again ... will change the whole concept of car ownership entirely. An owner will make money from their EV ... driving down costs further.\n\nThe energy density in modern batteries is already sufficient to begin looking at electric boats as a realistic option over the next few years. There are already million mile batteries with 6 - 700 miles range and that's increasing all the time.\n\nHelicopters ... then maybe one day planes. Though air travel in itself could be tolerable for now if all other criteria are met.\n\nOil as a fuel not only is dead but necessarily has to be made dead and buried.\nI think you'll be surprised at how quickly things will change over this decade. The likes of B.P have already announced their reduced production timeline up to 2035 and the immediate start of their own transition to a net zero, green energy company by 2050.\n\n2050.\nThat's what Biden said.\nNet zero emissions by 2050.\n2035 is the date set out in the Paris accord.\nYou aren't doing enough.\nYou are still not honouring your global obligations.\nYou still don't seem to grasp the severity of our current existential human predicament.\nThis is a climate 'crisis'.\nWe should be acting like it.\nYou seem to think we have a choice in any of this?\nWe do not.\nWe are screwed.\nIt is now about survival, and trust me ... in the coming years that won't be granted to all no matter what we do now.\nThe earth is changing.\nWe are on it.\nIt's time to stop sticking our heads in the sand and deal with it as best as we can.\n\nWake up friend.\nWe can't stop it now.\nIt's too late.\nThis is about mitigation.\n\nYou guys need to make this your next Apollo program ... but on a much grander scale.\nWhen you're starting from so far behind all the others you need to do more in the beginning to catch up in the end.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Kifwoo", "channel": "UCTu8SWolI1vFRWG4jvesewQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/Ll9tlqJTJYAzBe7IEJgIbCDVZBT69co05yb3UYKU7P5y_9GJgUTtQXb_ry2ixi91g9xJBNvJMg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Biden  has plans for all kinds of infrastructure repair and expansion, because now  compared to most countries in the western world (and much of the eastern, too) ours is getting old and dangerous. We have bridges and roads desperately in need of repair, and just like how in the 1930s the WPA brought modern power  lines to rural areas, those same kinds of areas-and even some urban ones- now need high speed internet. This should open up many, many thousands of jobs, before we even get to solar and other renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels are not only finite resources, but they also are quickly creating bigger problems than we may even be able to solve already.

Stfu. \n\nFrom Newsweek:\n\nWhen the State Department released their report on the Keystone XL pipeline last month, news media focused on the report's conclusion that the pipeline would not significantly worsen carbon pollution. The finding was broadly declared a win for advocates of the project, who are now imploring the White House to approve it.\n\nBut buried in the 11-chapter report was a less sunny detail: the Keystone XL would create only 35 permanent jobs after the one or two years of construction jobs dry up.\n\n\"Once the proposed Project enters service, operations would require an estimated 50 total employees: 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors,\" the State Department wrote.\n\nRepublican supporters of the pipeline have long said the project would be a major job creator. In 2012, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce took out a full page ad in the New York Times warning President Obama not to say \"no\" to \"20,000 jobs,\" a number taken from the pipeline company's estimates.\n\nNEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >\nWhen Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.-R) said in a speech in 2012 that the pipeline would \"employ 20,000 people,\" the fact-checking site PolitiFact rated his statement as \"false.\" PolitiFact noted that even if one were to accept the pipeline company's job number, each \"job\" is counted as one \"job year.\" That means that if the construction project lasted two years, one employee working for two years would be counted as having two \"jobs,\" leaving the number of employees at somewhere closer to 10,000.\n\nThe latest State Department report, which also defines a \"job\" as a position filled for one year, estimates that the project would create 16,100 jobs directly related to Keystone XL. Another approximately 26,000 year-long jobs would created indirectly (restaurant and store workers, for example, needed to accommodate the temporarily increased population along the pipeline). That brings the State Department's total to 42,100 year-long jobs.\n\nRELATED STORIES\nKeystone Pipeline Would Save 6 Lives a Year, Report Says\nKeystone Pipeline Will Not Affect Canada Oil Sands Growth: U.S. Report\nIncluded in that number, the report estimates that about 10,400 seasonal workers would be recruited for construction of the pipeline for jobs lasting four to eight months. If those short stints are calculated into an average annual jobs, that works out to 3,900 jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year for two years, the State Department wrote. After one to two years, the vast majority would leave, and 35 people would be permanently employed, according to the report.\n\nLast year, Obama dismissed the claim that the pipeline could reduce unemployment in the U.S., calling the potential impact of Keystone XL a \"blip\" in terms of job creation.\n\nNEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS >\n\"Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator,\" Mr. Obama said in an interview with the New York Times. \"There is no evidence that that's true. The most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two, and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people.\"\n\nA 2011 study conducted by Cornell University's ILR Global Labor Institute, which works with trade unions on environmental and other challenges, concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline could actually destroy more jobs than it created. The study takes into account job loss that would be caused if Midwesterners end up paying 10 to 20 cents more per gallon of gas due to the pipeline diverting oil from Midwest refineries to the Gulf region.\n\n\"Furthermore, pipeline spills, pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions incur significant human health and economic costs, thus eliminating jobs,\" Sean Sweeney, director of the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, the White House says Obama will wait at least 90 days from the release of the State Department report before deciding whether to approve the pipeline.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Steve B", "channel": "UCZbipdgtkjqnGs_SpQc_WvA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRK_l4jY4cSDLKeiWW3zaUkFU4cMhfTLbVqcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The vast majority of Scotland's energy supply comes from wind so high winds provide an overabundance of offshore energy supply generated amply by the turbines. We do also have other options like nuclear power and hydroelectric energy production to draw from. \nAs you know ... Scotland isn't the sunniest of places at the best of times and so we've maximised other sources to suit in our energy mix.\n\nThere have been some localised power outages due to faults in the transmission networks, but that's hardly anything to do with green energy. If anything it's just another reason to accelerate the transition to renewables by investing in battery storage and the localising of power distribution grids.\nIronically ... in the greener world of tomorrow no household would lose electric supply in a storm. Each home would be autonomous and separate from the grid. Self sufficient with a full battery of storage in the house.\nLocal sub stations would hold redundancy in larger power bank battery storage units that could continue to supply energy during almost any 'epic disaster'.\n\nThere is an epic disaster happening.\nThe climate crisis.\nIt's happening right in front of your face. A short mini ice age is but a precursor to the true glacial freeze of a more permanent ice age vacation. \nWe've been here before.\nIt's just not something you'd expect to see so dramatically in an inter glacial period. As the gulf stream moved south before the last ice age, Canada, North America, Europe, Russia and Siberia ... were engulfed by an advancing glacial ice sheet.\n\nI like a bit of snow for a few days or weeks at a time ... but not for millennia.\nOne day the gulf stream might not snap back.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Kifwoo", "channel": "UCTu8SWolI1vFRWG4jvesewQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/Ll9tlqJTJYAzBe7IEJgIbCDVZBT69co05yb3UYKU7P5y_9GJgUTtQXb_ry2ixi91g9xJBNvJMg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In the Netherlands  the natural gas pipelines and installations are tested and test used for transportation of hydrogen and it looks like it's a big succes. Hydrogen can also be used for heating houses. Cars, trucks, trains and even planes and ships will be tanking with high pressure hydrogen, much like LNG.

But I found your idea interesting and did some research:\nFirst off, we're talking about deuterium + tritium fusion here, which is the current state of technology and what ITER will be doing. Deuterium / Deuterium and Deuterium / Helium-3 work differently and produce less or no neutrons.\n\n1. The neutrons carry most of the fusion's energy (14,1 MeV) as kinetic energy and (as far as we know) can't be confined, so they collide with the walls of the reactor, which heats it up (which is then used to heat water and run a turbine). As far as I understand, free neutrons are usually caught by some atom quickly, so neutrons are rarely free long enough to go through their beta-decay or it will be quite tricky to do that.\n\n2. If we found some way to prevent the above and harness free neutrons until they decay, there are two parts that could in theory give more energy:\na) The electron, as you said, should be rather simple to catch - free electricity (I guess?!).\nb) The anti-(electron)-neutrino would probably be more difficult to get to annihilate as neutrinos don't interact much with anything, as you know. But what you describe is something like the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment (see Wikipedia): So if it annihilates, this happens: Antineutrino + proton --> neutron (again) + positron (\"anti-electron\"). The latter annihilates with an electron and produces two gamma rays (= photons) with an energy sum of about 1 MeV, while the neutron will usually be caught by some core (again, if not somehow contained). So, 1 MeV is rather measly in comparison to the 14 MeV from the neutron's kinetic energy, which we can mostly harvest.\nAlso note that you would have to put an electron into the annihilation first, so I don't know if the net energy outcome would even in theory be positive.\n\nHope I got this about right, just learned parts of it myself.

It’s possible to scale back fossil fuel production and replace it with renewable energy which is more cost effective, more sustainable longer term and pays better wages. But it’s all about what to do with the people currently working in those industries who fear what will happen to their livelihoods.\n\nIt’s a debate that needs to be had, and I hope progress can continue to be made, as it always has been.

One of the primary causes of government intervention into a market is to eliminate these externalities whether it be alcohol licensing, gambling regulations, reducing harmful toxins in cigarettes, protecting national parks from deforestation and mining etc etc. The same applies to slowly and carefully shifting to renewables.\n\nIn fact, shifting in a controlled manner will likely be better than if the market does it as it’s more likely to be done far more quickly and abruptly by the free market, as you said, which would be a much bigger shock to the people and communities who work in fossil fuel industries if they all lose their jobs pretty much overnight if renewables suddenly become cheaper and more efficient.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Tyler Hopcroft", "channel": "UClUZR9LUxZX1MnubXGxxkgg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRfpYzFpuLXNnMK1xlZ-qBNud_-lviQiNzhfw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So if governments increase  the cost of energy  by installing costly renewable power plants and storage batteries and impose costly environment regulations  for these companies to manufacture their goods, then these companies will simply offshore their business to other countries that have lower energy costs , lower labour cost and less regulations.\nNow if the whole world reduced their emission together then  everyone would be on an equal footing and we might be able to force the change over to renewables . However,  China and india are the biggest carbon emitters in the world and they don’t have to start reducing  their emissions until 2030. So that’s  why governments have such resistance to investing in 100% renewables , because it could destroy their economy and give significant competitive advantage to countries like China and India .", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Dorian Shades of gray", "channel": "UCZU1vf-oDeB-vnTJshdZnhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT5hTYkJYWhVFJt0YQNUykym7uHLAeqFs9KM2bW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
