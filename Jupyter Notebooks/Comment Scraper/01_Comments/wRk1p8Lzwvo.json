And if those time frames were to be included in the many climate studies that seem to choose the 60's as starting points, the actual climate change would appear much less significant if not in the other direction as the climate alarmist would like you to believe. I certainly hope that a number of climatology alarmists and politicians aren't deceiving us for their personal gain...funding, or political ambitions. My opinion is that if we want to become a third world country all we need to do is eliminate our dependable current energy sources and switch to wind, solar, etc. which at this point in time cannot come close to fulfilling our energy needs. If I had to choose between some pollution (maybe our goals should be to make our energy suppliers better and better) and being a third world country (and, I have been to some of those countries and can assure you that you don't want to become one), I will take a chance on improving our present energy situation such as we have done with cars... if you were in L.A. in the sixties and seventies you would have seen how awful it was and would realize we adapt extremely well.", "time": "2 days ago", "author": "Its Me Again", "channel": "UC53x0vJU7PHMrO-yE1fJntg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSA0VWEDAwGqVHBN5MEtXCQXBTJWYkhhdEm_w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Poor countries have far less emissions per person thus much less scope to cut emissions and are also the most effected by AGW.

But the loss of life is almost always worse in the poor country.  Why is that?  Because more expensive stuff exists in the US.  \nAs economies expand, there are more expensive things generally.  Therefore, any disaster will do more damage than the same disaster would have in the past.  \nIt should also be noted that if a country’s population grows without a corresponding improvement in building standards and emergency preparedness, more people will be at risk during a disaster.  Which would cause more loss of life, LA getting hit by an extremely severe earthquake or a small town in Alaska experiencing the same earthquake?  \nIt seems to me that there IS more stuff out there, and there’s also more people.  \nDo you have evidence that the actual severity of storms, as measured by wind speed and rainfall is getting more severe?

And I certainly don’t believe that unemployed people are funding them.  \nI believe that generally universities have been taken over by some pretty radical people, and so they are more likely to graduate people in all fields if they conform to some very leftwing ideas.  I also believe that the mainstream media is very biased, which causes them to report on climate issues (and other things) in the most alarmist fashion possible.  Findings and predictions are exaggerated, and only the scientists with the most radical views are given any exposure.  I also believe that some scientists with opposing (or at least more moderate views) stay quiet, or go into other fields of study altogether, because they are afraid of being called “climate change deniers” if they don’t conform to the required views on climate change.  \nI’m also a bit curious about your repeated statements that Shapiro gets funding from the Koch family, to the point that you keep calling him a “Koch employee.”  I’m not saying necessarily that you are wrong about the funding issue, but can you tell me how you know this?  It seems like the kind of thing that some people would throw out without any proof.  And even if it was true, it’s still dishonest to refer to Shapiro and others as employees of the Koch family, for the same reason that it’s unfair to refer to Democratic politicians as employees of unions or Planned Parenthood if they get donations from those institutions.  \nI will actually agree with you that an organization calling themselves a free speech club should have a wide range of speakers, including ones that I disagree with.

A friend of mine passed exams but failed because he didn’t obey his right leaning lecturer. But the right wing media if far worse. Fox and Sky, all owned by Big Oils Genie Energy’s Rupert Murdoch almost never has real scientists on and has vastly distorted and fake news on AGW. That is why newspapers, blogs and TV aren’t the place to look. I often use video because a picture paints a thousand words but I try to use ones with links to papers or ones with good explanations. As the loudest people in the media are usually the very few “sceptics” who have opposing views to science I find it hard to believe your claim about staying quiet.\r\n\r\nWhy do I call Ben a Koch employee? I Googled who funds him and the list includes the Kochs,  Betsy DeVos and her family, Robert and Rebekah Mercer etc etc. But again Ben and others throw out the claim that climate scientists are doing it because of who funds them. I did it to point out the hypocrisy. The stupidity is Ben is paid way more than climate scientists who would also earn far more working for the FF industry.\r They also do research to find answers, they don't get paid a bonus because of Al Gore, Greenies or whatever. If anyone were to disprove AGW they would win a Nobel and make a fortune.\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8Jo9QN0qA\r\n\r\n\r\n“But the other side of this argument is that leftist ideas already get ample exposure on college campi, and so they simply promote ideas that may be more difficult to hear on campus” Should they no also give exposure to the truth? And I thought Ben’s thing was destroying college kids? I think when it comes to AGW deniers get far more exposure and at least far more than they deserve. I’ve only ever seen someone debunk BS denier talking points on TV once or twice. They generally are allowed to talk without fact checking. These talking points have rarely changed since the 80's or 90's at least and can easily be debunked.\n\n\nIf it is only a political web blog then it should be honest and not call themselves “free speech”.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "James Pyke", "channel": "UC5HgwznWq0DguPYeH6cR2Kw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR1F0JJu6G0eYFb2jWMF1PgOP1Tnvf9kaG1ng=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The cost of addressing AGW according to Bloomberg would require a $12.1 trillion INVESTMENT not handouts, over 25 years. Or 10% of the FF subsidies. The current price of intervention we pay. Poor countries have far less emissions per person thus much less scope to cut emissions and are also the most effected by AGW. Also are reducing emissions as only 2 countries didn't sign up to Paris, one at war the other the US. So the Us pulled out of a meaningless agreement which deniers demand the US pull out of!!! LOL.

{"cid": "Ugw_l7raU_P8DZrg0Jp4AaABAg.9QCQAJKodXW9QHhTSlZ22G", "text": "1. “modeling has been wrong for 20-30 years”\n\nThis is either an accidental or intentional omission of a key detail about climate modeling. Scientists actually accurately predicted how much the earth was going to warm over the next couple of decades, but 90% of the heat was absorbed by the ocean. This will eventually catch up to us as ocean currents bring that heat to the surface and it becomes absorbed into the atmosphere.\n\n2. “water level will rise a predictable number of feet”\n\nAnother omission of a key detail. The actual water level isn’t so much a problem as when tropical storms interact with the higher waters levels, causing more damaging flooding and storm surges. And also I’ll add, when Mr. Shapiro says that this will cause humans to migrate as they’ve always done, I wonder how he’ll react when millions of climate migrants from poor countries in the third world come knocking on the door of the US. I wonder if he’ll liberalize his stance on immigration and advocate for allowing these people fleeing a problem that the US and other rich western countries are largely responsible for entry, or if he’ll advocate for tightening up immigration. (can’t imagine it will be the former.)\n\n3. “hurricanes aren’t getting more intense, humans are just developing more in the path of hurricanes”\n\nThe part about development is true but the part about hurricanes is utterly false. Climatologists consistently find that climate change is causing hurricanes to move slower and drop more rain, both of which causes more catastrophic flooding, which is what makes hurricanes disastrous— such as the case with Hurricane Harvey. Shapiro says hurricanes aren’t becoming more common which is true, but nobody who knows anything is actually arguing that. They are arguing that destructive hurricanes are becoming more common. Same goes for wildfires— scientists consistently find that climate change is making the conditions for destructive wildfires much more common.\n\n4. “it’s more costly to intervene than to do anything”\n\nI’m not familiar with the academic Shapiro cites so I’m not going to address him. However, this is such a bold claim to be making without giving a disclaimer on how complex and debates this issue is. (Not to mention the countless studies and scientists that fight fiercely against these claims.) There are too many unknowns with how fast climate change will start affecting the US to know whether economic growth will outpace growing disaster costs (however, a CBO report found that costs related to hurricane damage will grow at a faster rate than the US’s GDP, a factor of both climate change and development). However what’s clear is how much climate change will cost— for instance, should we build a $25 billion sea wall around NYC that may become obsolete within decades or spend much more to relocate huge parts of the city? How about billions of dollars doing controlled burns, thinning forests, and fighting fires, not to mention the lives risked and lost to fight the fires? And then the struggles over who’s going to pay for these initiatives arises. Should states fund all of it (they can’t)? If not, then the federal govt will have to cover part of it, but why would midwesterners have to pay tax dollars to fund relocations and sea walls on the coasts, and why would coast dwellers have to pay for wildfires? There is a huge amount of nuance Shapiro is just skating over here.\n\n5. “the US has done the most of any country to reduce emissions”\n\nTechnically true but implying that all countries are equally responsible for climate change and thus the US is doing the best on climate change is completely rediculous. China and India contribute as much/more to climate change than the US currently, but taking into account historical emissions, the US and other rich western countries have contributed much more to climate change as a whole because they’ve been industrialized much longer.

Before winter would come to the mountains the Indians would set fire to a big area and the hole camp would move to a lower elevation to get away from the extreme cold. In Spring they would return to the same area were by now new fresh sprouts of grasses and brush will be groin insuring a better deer hunt.

Now you have a State Gov that eliminated logging, were I use to see the logging trucks going down the mountain to the saw mill taking the sick and dead trees from the forest, wile other loggers were piling up the branches away from the ground to a clean dirt road eliminating the chances for fires, but since the mid 70's the State Gov stop the logging and brush removal, control burning etc. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE WILD INTENCE FIRES. its NOT CLIMATE CHANCHE.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "cordelmar", "channel": "UClc5ci3ra2ZP7ixKV74NArQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQQGVr4JlTgb8SXnTdOW2khthNYoWaOAJ2UjD37fA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you were about personal responsibillity, you would be about making the personally responsible decision for your future self, your children and others. His version of libertarianism and neo-classical economics is about \"lets get wealthy cos it's fun, and maybe we'll use put the toys towards something useful in the future, but only when it's absolutely necessary\". \n\nHe refuses to move past neoclassical economics, which has been debunked relentlessly due to it's assumptions that a) people are rational beings and will spend money in our own best interests and b) that we will be able to \"wealth\" our way out of every problem. People are not rational human beings. We smoke, drink, fuck our neighbours wives. And why? Because we are selfish and it feels good, not because we know that smoking will cause us lung cancer in the next 30 years.\n\nIf we go by the mentality of \"oh, we'll build our way out of it\" and \"it's not economically feasible now\" we are essentially no better than a 13 year old boy procrastinating doing his maths homework. Sure it would be a better investment in the future to do his homework now, but right now, it's a better investment to go and make friends because his priorities are on being cool. Similarly, the carbon emitting companys' priority is on money and power, and all the joys of life that come from that. \n\n\nWhy should we give a fuck about climate change? Well because of food. Agricultural yields are incredibly temperature sensitive. If we want to make sure the price of food stays down, we need to reduce our emissions. If you don't want to be paying an extra $2 dollars for every loaf of bread you buy, then you need to start investing in energy that comes from renewable farms.

And because of that we should be preparing for the mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for them that love Him. \r\n\r\nAnd the temperatures will be warmer, in general, because when the time comes, it will be a little warmer for the commandment keepers of God who keep the Sabbath Day Holy, to flee to the mountains because of persecution for keeping the 10 commandments of God, which includes keeping the Sabbath Day of rest.

Tackle food waste and make it maximal 5% of all produced. Go towards 0% fossil fuels with improved technology.

Free speech is only when needed for a moral and fact-based cause not to spread lies that is why we have restrictions on freedom of speech like yelling fire in a movie theater or bomb.

Plus he says next 100 years sea levels will rise, that is not correct, and second of all that is not the only problem we will have massive weather events and we are already experiencing problems with agriculture, deforestation, species extinction, etc. I like how Ben talks like an idiot yet no one realizes because of how fast he talks. Humans will migrate based on the weather patterns and the sea-level rise really, we can't even agree on a pandemic whether to put a mask you think people are going to leave their homes and the whole city of people relocated. Plus many of the weather patterns you say are coming unreliable too and that is because of the effect of us changing the climate. Also, who are those people going to sell their houses to freaking Aquaman, and actually Aquaman and his people would technically also die because of ocean acidification and etc. Also just because people move to a different location doesn't mean they are safe, you will just feel the effects of other weather patterns. When they meant by intensity they mean the cost of damage and the size and speed at which hurricanes happen big difference, Ben. Yeah, nice Ben developing countries are the reason and the developed have abided to reducing carbon emissions, yup put the blame on the people who are manufacturing the crap we want like steel, smartphones and other shit yet they are the ones impacted first and we are experiencing it also in the United States. We are the problem and the United States hasn't developed only in certain parts of the country, many states like Michigan have to drink water with contaminated lead so when we talk about developed I don't know what the F---k you're talking about.

The stripping of forests for plantations and habitats has changed the climate. \n\nThe planet’s climate has been controlled by life forms for 3 billion years as seen by earths carbon dioxide level of a mere 0.04% against our two neighbours mars and Venus that have 90%+ carbon dioxide. The burgeoning human population struggled to feed its own with grains that caused forests that bound soils and moisture to be ripped up and replaced with dry fields with no topsoil retention. So plant life’s grip on the climate was weakened and the climate shifted slightly. \n\nThe solution is to return the forests and feed the population at the same time. New plant factories in the Netherlands (53°N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.\n\nBuild plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\nUse cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\nUse goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\nUse agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\nUse marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\nUse minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon’t be misanthropic. Be positive. Be useful. Help flora and fauna control climate and don’t demonise plant food (carbon dioxide).\n\nIt’s now possible with plant factories to make a country like Britain self-sufficient in food and return its arable land to forests. It just requires the focus of resources.\n\nThe individual can also help reducing the rape of forests by moving away from grains into plant and animal fats and proteins with the keto diet and live longer and healthier lives.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Jeff Harmed", "channel": "UCiNa7yDepQw78yq27hNkdPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQbPBg6gp-7JtbrHa-Lt8WakRy_Scr4HF_5PHSW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxiGKmuz8BIVZeC_1F4AaABAg", "text": "The problem I have seen with the debate on whether the climate on earth is warming exponentially caused by humans versus the earth goes through natural cycles and is always changing, is that the vast majority of the scientists who claim that humans cause the climate to warm and if nothing changes all of our coasts will be under water by, insert date here, are funded by the government in one way or another. I didn’t give a specific year because since the late 80s, that specific date continues to change. Once we reach the previous prediction for when our coasts will be under water or the polar caps will be ice free or we won’t be witnessing snowfall anymore, they change said date. This has happened a half dozen times now. The scientists who believe that we go through natural cycles, I’ve found not to be funded by government. Both hypothesis have not been proven, we do not know what is going on with our climate, which they fail to say when making such claims. The government funded studies also claim the sun not playing a major role in our climate. I’m no scientist by any means, but that just seems ludicrous to say given that the sun literally affects everything here on earth. To me, the sun having major affects on our weather AND climate, just seems like logical common sense. But their climate prediction models show little if no interference by the sun. This is a HUGE problem with the hypothesis of human activities being the main driver of our climate. Once the models include the sun being a bigger driver to our climate over human activity, then we will finally see the true state of our climate and what it means going forward.

{"cid": "Ugz4u9CWZcInN3sD7eB4AaABAg", "text": "I wish he would expand on his answer.  His rationale seems sound but he leaves out a two key points.  First, it was a choice by the economy to go the fossil fuel route.  120 years ago Big Oil basically made sure that world would turn toward the internal combustion engine, oil was already in demand and this was a tremendous potential market for them, which stunted the growth of electric vehicles for a century.  It simply wasn't profitable or worth it to take on such a large industry.  We are only now seeing that electric vehicles are more powerful and have a much smaller long term impact on the environment.  By that I mean that it is a much more carbon emission producing process to make an electric vehicle then a gas, but you quickly see that the carbon deficit of an electric vehicle shrinks when compared to a gas vehicle running for 5 to 10 years.  I don't think its a magic bullet to fight climate change due to the way that most electricity is created, either by coal, trash burning, or oil, but its a good start to say the least.  Second, climate change is much more than rising sea levels.  Most scientists agree that it will cause widespread changes in weather pattern, amongst other things, that can lead to crop failures, mass extinctions, etc...  Try to imagine if bread all of a sudden cost $100 a loaf because there was a failed wheat harvest or if a steak cost $250 because pasture land has shrunk to almost nothing and now only the rich can eat beef.  In other words, putting it in pure eceonomic terms, its an extremely complicated issue and we do need to think about if making today's dollar is worth massive wealth erosion in the future.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "Aaron Edwards", "channel": "UCP7NGmOIXtlFxaigcRDaOdg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRObamtu0_BctM2_yNEaet2eOVa2iz5KwkASdeZWA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I live in India, where close to half a billion people are dependent on agriculture for income and the rest half billion for food(meaning that rain is very important).  For thousands of years, the climate has been steady, monsoons have come at the same time every year at the right time to produce the max amount of food. But recently, monsoons have become very unpredictable in terms of amount of water and pattern. Millions of farms have failed thanks to lack of rain or too much rain. If u ask families that have been farming for many many generations, they tell us that something is actually wrong. From the pattern of insects that act as pollinators to spread seeds naturally to rain required. There are too many pests and natural anti-pests have decreased so they have to use a lot of chemicals that might cause poisoning. Climate change does have actual ramifications across the world right now. Its just starting. and its gonna get much worse. Its a chain process where acid rain might kill small insects on the ground which reduces the number of natural pollinators so trees become less and less. therefore herbivores become less. food for carnivores and top of the food chain becomes less and including destroying of their natural habitat is upsetting the entire system that was stable for millions of years. We dont see it. phytoplankton produce half of earths oxygen. they are very small and live in the ocean. Now we all wear synthetic fibres. there micro-plastics when washed end up in the ocean and kill our major source of oxygen and we dont even know about it.

{"cid": "UgwdlHstWxRumLgFWa94AaABAg", "text": "Sadly to see someone who is so eloquently with his argument can still be wrong. \n- The models actually predicted climatechange pretty damn good https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming\n- He states over 50% of global warming is contributle by human activity, he is not wrong with that but he forgets to state that the \"extremly likely\" (95%-100% probability) scenario from the same IPCC he mentioned says it is \n\"IPCC’s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around 110% of observed warming (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years.\"\n- He talks about migrating humans and when i think about how much social disturbance in the politicla and economic can be caused by just a couple of hundred thousands migrants, how about a couple of millions. He also is not mentioning the people living on Islands that sunk. First Who takes care of them and how woud you feel if someone destroying your land and says well \"you can migrate\".\n- He talks about the Hurricans not getting stronger over the last decades. He is wrong about that hurricans are measured by their damage alone, there are changes happening that are already measurable. Here are some:\nMost importantly the storms slowed down in speed which is bad as they tend to stay longer along the coast line and therefore causing much more damage and do not resolve them selfs over land as quickly. The hurricans also moved north therefore affecting other cities that arent that well prepared, in fact it happend more often than before that the hurrican was able to reach UK after going over florida. Next thing is that warmer water means more moisture and therefore the storms are wetter and causing more damage, to put it in the words of trump \"they are the wettest nowadays\"\n- He talks about Wiliam D. Nordhaus in regards to the economist and he is actually one of the biggest advocates for good climat politics and is one of the founder of the CO2 Taxation. Here is what he had to say \"Mankind is playing dice with the natural environment through a multitude of interventions – injecting into the atmosphere trace gases like the greenhouse gases or ozone-depleting chemicals, engineering massive land-use changes such as deforestation, depleting multitudes of species in their natural habitats even while creating transgenic ones in the laboratory, and accumulating sufficient nuclear weapons to destroy human civilizations.\"[21] Under the climate change models he has developed, in general those sectors of the economy that depend heavily on unmanaged ecosystems – that is, are heavily dependent upon naturally occurring rainfall, runoff, or temperatures – will be most sensitive to climate change. Agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation, and coastal activities fall in this category.\" \nSo he is an advocate and has laid groundbreaking work in regards to the best economic mechanisms to apply to be most effective. On the otherhand his estimation of the costs is very flawed and he also stepped back on that matter. Basically using his function to estimate the costs our GDP would only drop by 4% if we go back into the ice age where Canada, Ireland, Scotland, northern Germany, Poland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were under 1 kilometer of ice. If this doesn't seem flawed to you then what does? In more complex terms: \"Damage Function\" should be a quadratic equation. To demonstrate this he says that since his damage function is symmetrical \"it predicts precisely the same level of damage to GDP from a fall of, for example, 4°C in the global average temperature, as it does for a rise of 4°C.\" Here is more to that topic: https://evonomics.com/steve-keen-nordhaus-climate-change-economics/ \n- He talks about US leading the CO2 Emission reduction and he is absolutly right about that and that has been a tremendous success. But US also has the longest way to go but i have not doubt that this can be achieved adopting the policies that William D. Nordhaus is advocating for like CO2 Taxation or better a Cap and Trade system.\n- He talks about the Paris climate change agreement he says that this is just a piece of paper that is not mandatory and he is absolutly right about that. On the otherhand let's look at what it had achieved. It basically brought nearly all countries except of 7, onto one page and to sign something. That is probably one of the most astonishing achievements within politics, think about how though it is to sign something in your own government on bipartisan base now multiply that by 188 i bet even signing that the earth is round will be a tough debate :). One other positive thing is that it in some way takes care of the global responsiblity and gives developing nations the chance to catch up and putting harsher restrictions on the developed world which helped the acceptance of climate policies around the world a lot.\nBut in general i am with Ben that it is not binding enough but i also see the benefits of it and that it is not black or white but grey. \nThese are some of the points where Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro fail to apply there rationalthinking in a proper way. When you think about how well they view other topics from different stand points they seem to be off when it comes to climate policies. This might be the case in order to form a little bit of counter weight which can help improve the discussion but as laid out by Ben in this clip is actually more derailing it by building the argument on a lot of false or at least misrepresented statements.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "einruB Erhardt", "channel": "UCHmLMoWE7Mv-ZjYmxPGW4Lw", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSTVjK_0QSX-SMS3NzafbV1boKGarnlhO-1PQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

What do you do to fix the issue besides say i believe in science and climate change is real? Sure its great you addressed the problem now offer a solution. And dont say solar and wind.

Activists just want to bring awareness to the subject, but I totally agree that there’s a much better way to get the message across, especially while still providing sources of research.  One of the biggest issues with climate change is that it is incredible cyclical, as in the alteration of certain climate aspects will effect various climate factors, and those factors will affect other factors, and so on.  However, the primary sources that we can pinpoint are the trapping of solar UV radiation via greenhouse gases/ozone and increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Currently, research has suggested that two of the biggest causes of rapid climate alteration are fossil fuel usage and deforestation.  Two solutions (I know it’s much easier said than done) is to scale back drilling for oil and mass development while having to cut down forests and woody areas.  One more specific solution is to dial back in irrigation techniques used in agriculture.  Irrigation and fertilizer usage lead to the runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus leak into streams and waterways that can give rise to harmful algal blooms and eutrophication, which will kill surrounding plants.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Max Morgan", "channel": "UCbEY2d1Lyi58ZDBPIZMpvMA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuKqJlZjvvttZTy8pRPbn1Ais0ond8a27TXg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

How much of it comes from human activity again is debatable. Fact is climate change has been occuring for centuries. I agree deforestation is not good and shouldnt happen as frequently. I believe president trump made it a point to protect forests and ban dumping into oceans. Which is a good step. When i say people that say science is real and if you dont believe me you are stupid and uneducated... What is your solution to fixing fossil fuels? We cant rely on wind and solar which is made up of rare earth elements which takes a lot of drilling... From china... The worlds leader in CO2. My solution is nuclear power... Its safer than it was 4 freaking decades ago. Now the unfortunate reality is we cant ever stop using oil and gas. We can be less dependant on to produce energy but we cant ever get rid of it. You use it to make hot water and people prefer to cook with natural gas than electric stoves. And we also cant rely on electric cars since they also take tons of rare earth elements to make batteries for them. Again all from china. My solution is if we start relying on nuclear power like france does... We can drastically reduce CO2 enough to still use oil and gas for vehicles and household appliances.

The 1% uber rich class has the most power.  They select most of the government officials via the GOP and Fox news.

So again Ben's feelings can't make up their Koch funded mind.

{"cid": "Ugw4uv0rnCaUQqeZJ8V4AaABAg.9EqHLsuoV2Q9FcBK9dyCi3", "text": " @Rohn Duke  Your link didn't work so I shortened it and got the political hack Goddard's junk video that as always shows his complete lack of understanding of both science and logic. AGW makes fires worse by increasing temps which dry out the land/vegetation more and create more droughts. It cannot change history and make past fires cease to of happened. His childish argument is basically cancer has happened in the past so smoking cannot increase the risk of cancer.\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/US/climate-change-affects-wildfires-west-makes-worse/story?id=73019448\n\nhttps://www.futurity.org/wildfires-climate-change-california-2179612/\n\nThen his quotes a book, not scientific papers but a book from a disc jockey that lies about AGW to lie about Mann. Mann's hockey stick is a summary of studies confirmed by multiple other studies.\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11646-climate-myths-the-hockey-stick-graph-has-been-proven-wrong/\n\nhttps://skepticalscience.com/broken-hockey-stick.htm\n\nThen lies and misquotes climate scientists.\n\nThen again lies about \"global cooling\". From about the 1940's to 70's the increased use of dirty coal emitted copious amounts of particulate mater into the sky which reflected sunlight and temporarily cooled the planet. The consensus was always that this temporary cooling would eventually be swamped by GHG warming. Heller knows this as it has been repeatedly pointed out to him. But he prefers hi$ lie$. These aerosols also produced smog, acid rain increased cancer rats etc and when the Clean Air Act was implemented and coal companies were forced to clean up there act, the warming returned. Despite their complaining about big government, socialist, one world government take overs, designed to take away your freedoms (to die from cancer I guess) that would crash the economy and send us all back to the caves (sound familiar) this never happened. And we all prospered. Go figure....\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0nHXnfHK-0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VriOsL4nGOE\n\nScience progresses by discovering more and more information. We know more now than in the 1970's for example. Even more than the 1870's etc. So once again his childish argument is we must dismiss all modern learning because a select few thought differently in the past. Or rather Goddard misrepresents what we knew in the past. So again his argument is the earth is flat because ancient people thought so and we must ignore all modern understanding and science.\n\nAnd as always he hides from science and cherry picks news paper articles...go figure.\n\nThen uses a series of quick fire graphs without context or understanding to again mislead. \"Global disaster deaths\" which has nothing to do with CC but rather advancement in science from medicine, weather forecasting, better designed buildings and greater regulations, better heating and cooling, better drainage systems etc etc.\n\n\"Crop yields\" have increase as the population has...wonder why. He's too dumb to figure out the connection can you? More people to feed, better farming practices, fertilizers, bug sprays, genetically modified crops, more farm land etc etc. He also ignores future effects of AGW which according to a meta study of over 70 research papers, wheat, corn, rice and soybeans make up two-thirds of humans' caloric intake on average can expect 3.1 to 7.4 percent less yield per degree Celsius of warming.\n\nThen misrepresents the temporary \"greening\".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpdgUwu4DaY&t=24s\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-stopped-getting-greener-20-years-ago/\n\nThen ignores the greatest mass extinction occurred due to rapid warming of the planet from GHG induced warming from volcanic activity and giant coal deposits catching fire over centuries know as the P-T extinction event. He also ignores the fact humans are not trilobites and have never experience these levels of CO2 and sustained warming let alone future warming. Or the consequences of that warming.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNgqv4yVyDw&t=16s\n\nIronic that a political hack like Heller accuses real scientists of the very thing he does.

Let’s go through this cacophony of BS shall we? “Tell me something,if we need all these scientists all paid by someone…” oh you have always worked for free??? Hypocrisy anyone? Nice crocodile tears and weak way to ignore deniers are paid by the FF industry though.

Gravity was proven a long time ago but research continues. Those scientists get paid, I’ve seen no changes yet it varies across the planet depending on location However, AGW has been proven a long time ago but more research is done into all areas for different reasons such as to link past changes to current to get better estimates of the consequences, to monitor the affects, to see how it effects different regions, to assess tipping points, to gauge if it is getting worse etc. But as more and more research comes in the effects seem to be worse than first thought that’s why deniers want research to stop. For example, poles are melting faster than expected, not only is storm intensity getting worse quicker than expected the number appears to be increasing which was seen as unlikely to occur. Scaremongering deniers don’t want that known. They need you to be scared of cheaper electricity, clean air and water, lower taxes, no more wars for oil and job creation etc and imaginary big scary GSM and ice age as we WARM, one world government, Marxist, Socialist New World Order Lizard People conspiracies.\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n“…cause I haven't seen any changes…” ahh the ostrich argument.

But the scaremongering from the big oil owned fake news media don’t want you to know that. Or the fact it has been driven higher because inflation, the $5.3Trillion a year FF “subsidy” gravy train and protectionism and FF handouts from FF bribed big governments.\n\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lazard.com/media/450436/rehcd3.jpg\n\n\r\n\r\n“…and if you think you can’t change the climate, or ignore how on multiple occasions how we have already changed it, well good luck with that!

Continued GW (which is basically weather) can lead to the entire climate changing (average weather over time). However a right wing political think tank, headed by Luntz,  found their members were emotionally challenged and easily frightened by words. \n\n\"...“Climate change’’ is less frightening than “global warming; ” As one focus group participant noted, climate change “sounds like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale.” While global warming has catastrophic connotations attached to it, climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge.\" \n\n\nNow they blame everyone else for their BS and the frightened emotionally challenged still believe.

The FF industry receive $5.3 trillion a year in big government socialist welfare handout \"subsidies\" a year. 10x more than the coat of addressing AGW. Compare that to the TOTAL NASA budget of $650B since it was set up since 1958. NASA spends a small fraction of the total budget on Earth science research. Then we have the Kochs who bragged of spending a $B on the 2016 election cycle alone. Add Exxon etc etc and research makes a small fraction of the trillion denial industry who DO NO RESEARCH but just write paid BS. \n\nExxon even shut down research because it found AGW and management wanted to protect their multi $million jobs and multi $trillion handouts and multi $trillion companies. Yes follow the money but deniers never do because they don't like what they find.

Regardless of your views on the shut down -- I personally consider it a massive political blunder -- it did have the effect of reducing air and surface travel by millions of people and of suppressing the gross national product of those nations.  And sure enough, urban pollution and carbon emissions feel dramatically.  If people don't drive cars or visit other people and lock themselves in their houses, they pollute less. \n\nBut to my knowledge, that enormous drop in carbon output and demonstrably reduced pollution had no measurable effect on climate.  It seems more likely that the Milankovich cycles and varying energy output of the sun, plus other cosmic factors, have a greater effect on climate than human carbon output.  We would be much wiser to focus our environmental energies on solving problems through means that will not destroy Western economies or prevent developing countries from raising their standard of living.  Clean up the oceans and rivers, find better ways to treat human sewage, develop more comprehensive ways to recycle electronic and plastic components: all of these are technically feasible and pose no risk to our economic welfare.  Of course that does not sit well with neo-Marxists, for whom \"climate change\" was intended to be a means for destroying capitalism and the democracies of the West.

The Nobel prize winner in climate change economics said that he did not want to make dire predictions about the climate crisis, which is why the model he used is considered to be a weak one, which is against what most scientists believe today.\nhttp://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/news/a-nobel-prize-for-the-creator-of-an-economic-model-that-underestimates-the-risks-of-climate-change/\n\nDeveloped countries like the US and big developing countries like India and China are the biggest contributors to climate change, so it makes sense that they will have to put in the most effort. Small and poorer developing countries are actually feeling the negative effects of climate change tearing into their economy through famines and floods, and they don't have a lot of room to fight it. \nhttps://www.un.org › press › gaef35...\nUnprecedented Impacts of Climate Change Disproportionately Burdening Developing ...\n\nBen says even if the sea level rises by a few inches, people will just move like they've always done. This is an understatement about the devastating impact of rising sea levels on coastal populations in poorer countries like India, Bangladesh  etc, where millions of people will be potentially wiped out. In fact, it's already happening, considering the recent devastating hurricane which hit Bengal. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise\n\nFishing will be impacted as a fish die out, agriculture will be affected near coastal areas and a lot of land near the coast will go underwater. Another way to understand this is, this is not about whether you eat fish or farm near the coast - this is about being comfortable with losing a huge source of food and life. It will drive up living costs for the people who survive and make it impossible for a lot of us to live, since unfortunately we only got this one planet to live on for now.\n\nI can go on and on, but if you don't get it by now, you never will. This is a crisis, no matter how much you undersell it. This isn't about a hundred years later, this is genuinely about the day after tomorrow.

I am the antechrist. My work is complete; now bored, I tease and torment my charge for fun. If your eyes work, look- a swastika is an image in the sky many years ago. It is the image of the likeness of the effect of an approaching black hole. A 'drain' in space. And Hitler was trying to save you from it by killing my ancestors. It went after the sun first, of course. 'Dark ages'. No sun for nine months. Then we followed, catching up to the sun. Beatles song about that event. Now, it looks like the universe is expanding and accelerating. No. We are accelerating IN. Because there is no reward for killing a living copy of the periodic table.  And to keep you here, I have cursed you with immortality, even the dead, the pre-dilluvian, all. The 'ressurrection' is really the zombie apocalypse! To make matters worse, the earth is gaining 20 billion tons of space dander a day! Soon, it will seek an orbit closer to the sun. We will have to live under ground for the heat, with nothing to eat but each-other! Hell on earth for 10 million years! Eventually, the earth falls into the sun, at the center of which, no time can pass. An eternal lake of fire!\nI did this to keep humans out of Life, the everlasting, the Blue. We are in the Red, going the wrong way around the sun. The rest of the universe is in the Blue, going the right way in time-space. Nothing dies. We cant see them and they cant see us, but we are called the \"world of sins\". And killing God and me and all our friends in a body made from the periodic table was a huge mistake.  Now, we are never getting out of here, except those re-incarnated together in Isa Marova. Now, humans will never harm the Blue the way we did this planet. Because salvation is FOR the just FROM the wicked.\nAnd God the creator is one of us! He didnt know he was God, he doesnt like being God, and doesnt like us! We make him miserable!

That's false; climate models have done quite well in predicting global warming, for example. Shapiro also cites the IPCC while discussing this topic. Yet even the IPCC disagrees with him on this; the IPCC, and others, note that the IPCC's model-based forecasts often under-estimated climate change:\r\n\r\n\"Evaluating the performance of past climate model projections\"\r\n\"Assessment of the first consensus prediction on climate change\"\r\n\r\n\"It is now nearly three decades since the first assessment report of the IPCC, and over that time evidence and confidence in observed and projected ocean and cryosphere changes have grown (very high confidence [...]). Confidence in climate warming and its anthropogenic [a.k.a. human-made] causes has increased across assessment cycles; robust detection was not yet possible in 1990, but has been characterised as unequivocal since AR4 in 2007. Projections of near-term warming rates in early reports have been realised over the subsequent decades, while projections have tended to err on the side of caution for sea level rise and ocean heat uptake that have developed faster than predicted [...] [page 1-13 in section 1.4].\"\r\nhttps://report.ipcc.ch/srocc/pdf/SROCC_FinalDraft_FullReport.pdf\r\n\r\npage 86 of: \"Climate change skepticism and denial: An introduction\"\r\n\"Reexamining climate change debates: Scientific disagreement or scientific certainty argumentation methods (SCAMs)?\"\r\n\"Climate change prediction: Erring on the side of least drama?\"\r\n\"Global warming estimates, media expectations, and the asymmetry of scientific challenge\"\r\n\"Comparing climate projections to observations up to 2011\"\r\n\"Comparison of dryland climate change in observations and CMIP5 simulations\"\r\n\"Accelerated dryland expansion under climate change\"\r\n\"The Copenhagen diagnosis: updating the world on the latest climate science\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Shapiro position is rebutted by an overwhelming about of scientific evidence on confirmed model-based predictions on climate change.

Which one is it? The two situations are completely different and warrant different responses. \n2 What statistics don’t back that up? What fucking statistics are you reading? Are you reading the Journal of Applied Meterology and Climatology? Have you read the papers on how temperature increases in the water lead to hurricanes having significantly more energy and destructive power? Pretty sure you won’t be knowing about any of these stats if all you read all day is the twitter feeds of anti-scientific climate change deniers.\n3 Intensity of hurricanes means the energy with which hurricanes are striking the coast. Also, the path of hurricanes is notoriously unpredictable, so you won’t be building shit “in the path of hurricanes”, unless your plan is to evacuate the coastal areas and build everything inland, which is a stupid fucking idea. \n4 Idk which Nobel Prize winner he’s talking about, but it is probably the economist Paul Romer. Idk where from his works this line has been picked from, but Romer is a known advocate for public action against climate change, and a fierce one. Shapiro doesn’t name the ‘laureate’ because he doesn’t want to face heat on Twitter for misrepresenting the person’s views. Shapiro is known for twisting cherry-picked comments and has been proved several times to be a dishonest actor, so I would like to see everything he says supported by references.\n5 Ben’s audience does what conservatives are known to do. They pull their pants down and bend over in the presence of the first semblance of authority, which is how a buffoon like Trump won.

The science is very clear on that. Just look at the source from NASA below. Plus, the probability is high that the intensification of hurricanes has already been happening over the years. 2) William Nordhaus, the economist who won the Nobel price for his work on climate change, argues that it would be cheaper to mitigate emissions in the future, but this does not mean that - as Shapiro said - \"intervention would be counterproductive.\" Rather, Nordhaus' paper suggests to pursue economic efficiency with the timing of your mitigation options. 3) Shapiro said \"The Paris Accords were completely useless\" in 3:10. Well, it is only one agreement, not several accords. But no, thats not the false information of course, as I agree it could be mispronunciation. However, he uses polarizing and politicizing language. I could now list numerous IR scholars, economist and political scientists who would argue the contrary. However, I will not engage with Shapiro's overly bold and simplistic statement. \n\nSo, overall, it unfortunately seems to me that Shapiro is similar to most other deniers, with the slight difference that he dismisses evidence in a more sophisticated way. In any case, I believe his contribution to an intellectual debate is very limited. \n\n\n\nSources: \n1) https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/ClimateStorms/page2.php\n\n2) https://web.archive.org/web/20150917214704/http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/web%20rice%20summary%20102599.htm\n3) In case you were wondering about one of the arguments how the Paris Agreement has achieved something: Liliana B.

Solar Cycles causes climate change and Archimedes' principle, melting ice will not cause the water to rise to flood the earth (Al Gore's book and other alarmists) is observable science. Scientists follow the money is my observation. Alarmists cannot agree. A good read is: SHELLENBERGER: On Behalf Of Environmentalists, I Apologize For The Climate Scare\r By  Michael Shellenberger\nHumans are not causing a “sixth mass extinction”\r\n\n\nThe Amazon is not “the lungs of the world”\r\nClimate change is not making natural disasters worse\r\nFires have declined 25% around the world since 2003\r\nThe amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska\r\nThe build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California\r\nCarbon emissions have been declining in rich nations including Britain, Germany and France since the mid-seventies\r\nAdapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor\r\nWe produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter\r\nHabitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change\r\nWood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels\r\nPreventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture\r\nI know that the above facts will sound like “climate denialism” to many people. But that just shows the power of climate alarmism.\r Plants thrive on carbon dioxide.\r\nScientists changed global warming to the term climate change because the climate changes. There is no global warming alarm for the alarmists so they changed the narrative. Yes, I care we are polluting the planet and we should work on that. What concerns me more is mankind's free fall of power hungry, selfish, wicked treatment of each other. Romans 5:6, CSB: \"For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly.\"   2 Corinthians 5:19 For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them.

Let me put it this way, if we don’t have a habitable world to live in, literally, nothing else matters. If Earth warms to 2 degrees Celsius (at 1.5 C now), billions of lives could be displaced without a home resulting in mass death. Our increasing temperature is like a ticking time bomb for humanity and here we have people like you squabbling about a very subjective opinion on abortion. Ironically, abortion is actually mitigating the human population thus mitigating global warming. Humans at 7.5 billion need population control and abortion is a fantastic measure to implement that. I don’t give a shit what your sentiment on abortion is premised off. Abortion is debatable and highly subjective. Global warming isn’t. It’s real. It’s here. It’s the big elephant in the room that morons and politicians won’t talk about. You know why? It doesn’t make them money, it costs money to tackle global warming in many fashions. People that actually think abortion, racism, LBGTQ, economic etc types of issues are more pressing than global warming are ignorant/delusional. And the very problem that causes this is the idea that our rising global temperature won’t affect them in their lifetime therefore it’s not their problem and that cannot be anymore incorrect.

The assumption is what I am questioning. \nFirstly if you knew anything on law, you cannot draw a conclusion without a reasonable and justified premise. You can't even answer a basic question determining life and death under a medical perspective, and yet you proceed to call me a murderer and think you can convince me to agree with you haha. \nA necklace is neither dead nor alive, likewise, an egg cell (ovum) is neither dead or alive- it doesn't fit the premise. \n\nI did not conduct any 2nd/3rd trimester abortion on myself and never on another person- so what is your point? Nice try anyway. I'm a virgin and believe in sex after marriage, but I cannot impose this on others. Do you know how many women die, knowing they have a terminal health condition and yet not having the facilities to conduct an abortion? I can easily call you a 'murderer' in that context too.\n\n Secondly, if you don't believe medical scientists (who know more about life and death than you do), then you should never seek medical help even under terminal health conditions. You're saying all hospitals should shut down & ppl should only resort to praying when they're have a terminal illness? Quite selfish\n\n I never said anything about an embryo knowing and not knowing. I was literally just answering your question on how I'd feel if I were aborted in the 7th week. So don't twist why I brought this up. (Besides, a baby does know it's being killed- obviously it can feel pain- but that's not the argument- don't dig your own grave by saying something illogical). Anyway, hospitals are allowed to remove the mask of comatose patients even though their level of have cognitive brain functioning is significantly higher than what a fetus has in 11 weeks- is this murder to you? If you admit the reason one is declared dead is because they cannot come back alive, then what does it mean to come back alive? you just admitted that the person is not alive in the current state.\n\n Thirdly, I'm a statistics student who knows that despite the instantaneous rate or direction of transition, if the question is asking what state is it in now? The answer should be what state it is in now. Life or not life. The question isn't dead or alive.  If you agree that life ends when a person becomes brain dead, then what makes you think an embryo with absolutely no brain activity is a life?

If it is not a life it cannot die, and this it is not murder. Not everyone agrees that life begins at conception- it's a potential life not life itself. Can you use a scientific argument to counteract that a person who is brain dead is still alive? No, by the same argument, this is not a life yet\nOk, do you firmly believe that life only begins at conception? \n\n\nSecondly, you said if you are not dead, you are alive-  whereas an egg cell cannot do either. You haven't answered that. I am claiming that an embryo in the 7th week is in a  similar state- it's not a life yet. Hence cannot die. Please bring up scientific arguments. \n\nFor the last time, not everyone is Christian. When I said I wasn't christian, you assumed I was muslim. Again, you can be a non christian and non muslim and still be religious. THere are more than those 2 religions. The premise of being this or that, does not hold. \n\nYou called me a man and went on talking, but the original 'assumption' of me being a man is wrong. Similarly it's the 'assumption' that it is a life is what I am asking. How did you get to that assumption? Use science.\n\nYou said I'm not going to use science and use god instead, implying science doesn't know anything. This is why asked if we should shut down hospitals, and pray instead.  \n\n\"Medical scientists may or may not know more about life and death. But you as a medical student sure don't. For if you did, you'd know the basics of a life in the womb being a life, whether it's the 7th week or the 1st week or the 100th week. If anything I hope you at least read this, for it addresses your point about the \"assumption/premise that it is a life\". The reason it's a life is because it's a human being at conception who is alive. It's not an assumption. It's a fact. If it were a human being at conception who was dead, then that human being would be miscarried. The idea here isn't that it's merely 'alive'. The idea is that it's a human being who is alive. This isn't skin that's part of a human being that's alive because it's part of a living thing, this is an actual human being who has her own skin and her own egg cell. This isn't complex Ahli, not sure why you're unable to understand this.\"\n\nI am not a medical student, I am a statistic student, who just finished my PhD, and got their approval. So as soon as the official paper work is done I'm a scientist in statistics. As part of my research for statistics, I consulted doctors, specialists and read alot of books about this- so I know.  An embryo does not have skin, please.. you're just digging your own grave.\nListen you have not answered as to why it is a life, you are just going off the context of medical science. \n\n\n \"You're saying all hospitals should shut down?\" -Am I saying that? Is this how you perform your analysis as a 'medical student'?\n\n- Yes you said god prevails science and you don't care for the scientific argument. You haven't given me any scientific argument. \n\n\" \"I never said anything about an embryo knowing and not knowing.\" -Yes you did. Here, let me quote you. \"Ofcourse in the 7th week I myself was a potential life too, I wouldn't know any different if my mother terminated the pregnancy\" \"\n-  I said the reason I mentioned this is because you asked me how I would feel if I was aborted, and I said duh, I wouldn't know. So don't twist it. So I was just trying to answer your question on knowing and not knowing. I never said life depends on knowing / not knowing, I was just answering your question. There was no other reason for me to mention this, without your previous question. A baby (even at 20 weeks gestation in the womb) a baby does know if you kill it- it has consciousness- if you don't know what consciousness is then I can't help. You get consciousness in the 20th week of pregnancy. But I'm talking if reflexes, without which you are medically determined to be dead. It is completely not about 'feeling' pain or knowing pain, knowing anything at all- these only come later in gestation- not at 7 weeks. There's a huge difference between reflexes and consciousness.\n\nDo you think taking the mask off coma patients is murder? They have more cognitive brain activity than an 11th week fetus. \n\n\"@BullseyeBullsclaw Ben speaks with very limited understanding of science. I'm a scientist and a person who is medically brain dead is declared dead [...]\"\nI have done my PhD on statistics.

I specifically studied the effects of climate change between the La Nina and El Nino (ENSO) in the Pacific and North Atlantic ocean connecting Australia and North America. Since South Africa it is located in the southern hemisphere (like Australia), the frequency of cyclones are the reverse of what's measured in the North. i.e below the equatorial region, they spin in a clockwise motion, opposite to that of the North. This is because of the tropospheric walker circulation and 'density' of air. Warm air rises (near the equator) and cold air sinks causing an upwelling to result in cyclone formation.  Due to increased global warming, the formation of cyclones have become more frequent, and there is also a strong correlation for CO2 increase over the industrial revolution and global warming.  We have a strong correlation for Global warming, increased SST and cyclone activity.

So how is a fetus in the 1st trimester, which hasn't developed any form of electrical brain activity a life? It does not fit the premise. It's not a life yet so it cannot die or be alive- it's in the state of someone who is braindead. Please use science to refute, if not, I will understand, you have no knowledge on it. \nTo help you understand:\n7th week~ state which has no electrical or any brain activity, hence that of being braindead\n11th week~ electrical brain activity is there, but with minimal cognitive brain activity, i.e vegatative state\n20th week~ Has developed cognitive brain activity, i.e coma state \n22nd week to term~ Abortion is murder after the 20-22nd week.

However when ice ontop of land melts, it increases the volume of sea level and it brings on the real danger. You said NASA was false, then I gave you another source and said that's false too. Why should I or anyone else believe you, when thousands of scientists who have done independent studies on this speak otherwise? Do you think they will put their jobs at stake for something like this?\nI have done a kolmogorov smirnov test on this to understand how the global mean temperature has risen is proportional to the increase in cyclonic activity. Please don't misrepresent the issue by saying climate changes every day- no, the concern is the rise in climate over a threshold, not the fluctuations of daily weather conditions.

Yes- hence you can kill it.\nBefore you strongly use the term 'kill' you need to know the gestation period to declare if it is even a life in the 1st place. When the premise is 'is it a life?' the answer has to be yes or no, before deciding if it is murder or not.\nThis is not a comparison with someone in coma, a comatose patient displays electrical synapses and minimal cognitive activity (i.e reflexes and minimal consciousness) when a fetus at 7 weeks does not have any brain activity whatsoever (no reflexes and no consciousness).  Everyone knows it will become a life in the future, but the point is at the current state at 7 weeks it is not.

If you’d like to make little picks about his wording regarding the gentleman who won the Nobel Prize that’s fine, but he explained his point on hurricanes very well in terms of damage to cost ratio. Even if hurricanes are getting stronger, you look at the cycles, it is not at an intense rate that is going to be at devastating levels in the upcoming years, which kind of gives much rationale to believe that finance being spent on preventing the phenomenon right now rather than investment into more capable infrastructure for the future would seem very illogical.

As temperatures increase, the ocean’s water temperature increases. The global rise of temperatures causes more water vapor to form coming from the ocean. Warm air has the capacity to hold more water vapor. Water vapor fuels hurricanes. In the 21st century, there has been a significantly larger amount of hurricanes as compared to the 20th century, most of which are higher on the scale due to the added fuel. For example, there has been more than one category 5 hurricane in 2005, 2007, 2017, and 2019.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ButtonySquare8", "channel": "UCbrMNUZCdkTkCsT7M-a0eaw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT61kjjy2o2Qc3DP-SLQlLuAQ_8LhKvj58Z7exlRQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We need to diversify our energy so that the energy sources can “cover” for the many cons that they have. If solar is not efficient then let’s make it efficient through innovation, which comes from capitalism. Hydropower, geothermal, nuclear, and many other energy sources have many cons, but they are more reliable than solar and wind and we should innovate them to make them cheap, reliable energy sources so that people will use them instead of coals. Speaking of coal, we should reduce co2 emissions, but we cannot eradicate fossil fuels, since our economy runs on it. Droughts, floods, fires and stuff actually don’t have much impact on humans because fossil fuels gives us a safe environment, but the safe environment that fossil fuels have given us won’t last forever. My main concern of climate change is 3rd world nations. Developed countries are fine, but the droughts will completely destroy the crops of Africa and Asia, since they don’t have fossil fuels, and one day, the droughts will get so bad that people starve and thirst, and this is where vertical farming gmos come in. GMOs aren’t bad. Just watch the kurzgesagt video, but if we rely on fossil fuels forever, droughts won’t affect anybody as long as we have vertical farming, gmos, and a more efficient way to reuse water, which inevitably will come as new technology doesn’t happen to us but scientists create them, and innovation comes from capitalism. However, there is another thing about climate change: rising sea Levels. Like I said, nothing will be catastrophic, but bad crap will happen. This is why we should use natural gas and oil instead of coal.

{"cid": "UgzB1WEs1VD4VR-uET54AaABAg", "text": "According to Steve Goreham, the Executive Director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, the \"97% consensus\" of scientists who supposedly agree that humans are a significant contributing factor in global climate change was actually only a grand total of 75 out of 77 scientists who in 2009, answered two very poorly written questions about climate change. The online \"survey\" was conducted by Dorran & Zimmerman. They sent the survey to 10,257 people. 3,146 people replied to the survey. \n\nQuestion #1 was: When compared with pre-1800 levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?\n\nQuestion #2 was: Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperature?\n\n\n3,069 of the respondents answers were discarded because Dorran & Zimmerman decided that they were not actually real climate scientists, leaving only 77 respondents. Out of those 77, 75 of the people answered yes, that they believed human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperature. That was it. 75 out of 77 = 97%. According to Steve Goreham that's where they get the bullshit number of 97% of \"ALL\" scientists agree.\n\nAccording to Liz Wheeler, the host of OAN's (One America News) \"Tipping Point, the 97% number comes from a group of \"citizen scientists\" aka climate change activists, who claim that they analyzed 11,944 scientific papers on the human contribution to climate change. They came to the conclusion that 97% of the scientists were in agreement. \n\nAccording to Liz Wheeler, they \"analyzed\" these papers simply by doing a Google search within a scientific database for the terms \"climate change\" and \"human involved climate change\". Wheeler says that they didn't actually read what the viewpoints of the scientists really were, rather, they merely assumed that those search term results meant that those scientists agreed that humans were the largest contributing factor to global climate change. Wheeler claims that a group of \"actual scientists\" got together and actually did analyze those same 11,944 papers and discovered that only 0.3% of those scientists actually supported the original contention of those \"citizen scientists\" that humans were the primary driving factor behind climate change.\nhttps://youtu.be/i-qBOyrD0-0?t=636\n\nThe \"Global Warming Petition Project\" of 2007 opposed to Kyoto, which was done by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, was signed by 31,478 American Scientists including 9,029 with PhD's, ALL stating that (quote) \"there is NO convincing evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate\". (un-quote)\nhttps://youtu.be/mtHreJbr2WM?t=1713\n\n31,478 to 75... So now... just slightly over 0.22% (less than one quarter of one percent) of scientists agree that humans are a significant factor in global climate change.\n\nOn September 23rd, 2019, A global network of 500 scientists and other professionals signed a letter sent to the Secretary General at the United Nations stating the same exact thing! Stating that (quote) \"THERE IS NO CLIMATE EMERGENCY\"!! (un-quote)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpVBH-HY5Ow\n\nCurrent list of signees: https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ED-brochureversieNWA4.pdf\n\nThe Certified Letter: https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ecd-letter-to-un.pdf\n\nPress Briefing: https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ecd-press-briefing.pdf\n\nProminent scientists warn UN Secretary-General Guterres: https://clintel.nl/prominent-scientists-warn-un-secretary-general-guterres/\n\nYes, the climate IS changing. It has always changed and it will continue to change. Even the co-founder of Greenpeace, environmentalist consultant, Dr. Patrick Moore, states EMPHATICALLY that there is no catastrophic climate change occurring! \n\nThese climate change alarmists are mostly freak'n politicians pushing this false narrative for political purposes! AOC doesn't know a damn thing about climate change or global warming! For God's sake, she was pouring drinks for a living before she won a contest to be run for Congress and some morons in her district were actually stupid enough to vote for her! Now she just parrots what her handlers tell her to parrot!  Greta Thunberg is a mentally ill child, barely old enough to get a drivers license! How the hell would SHE know anything at all about the extremely complex subject of climate change and global warming!? How in the hell are these two, \"experts on climate change and global warming\"!?\n\nThe obama's obviously are not at all worried about sea level rise, since they just bought an 11.75 million dollar mansion in Martha's Vineyard! Do you know why they are not at all concerned about their new, almost twelve million dollar estate, not being under water soon? It's because they know the \"TRUTH\" is that the sea level \"MAY\" rise by \"MAYBE\" three or four inches over the next 100 to 150 years!! Al Gore also owns a multi-million dollar beach front estate!

That's because extinctions are caused by habitat destruction due to human encroachment not climate change. Polar bears live in hot climates in zoos around the world. The zookeepers simply feed them a diet that conforms to their habitat. A polar bear is first and foremost a bear. It can eat anything a regular bear can eat.

It is obvious to anyone who has lived in one for years that the climate has changed significantly the last few years, season’s climate is behaving abnormally compared to before  I.e: more droughts in fall/winter and delayed abnormal rain amount later. Now before anyone dismisses this by labeling me “ another liberal climate change advocate”, I must say that I’m one who is not clear if they his climate change is man caused or cyclical and which data I can trust besides my own observations. “Science” rather scientists are more controlled by politics and agendas than ppl are comfortable to concede, same with doctor worship vs reality of human nature and hospital/regulations politics.

Scientists are telling us that in order to ensure that the slow occurring feedbacks of climate change don’t happen we must keep the average global temperatures of the earth under 2 degree Celsius rise since 1990 AGT. In case that we could not accomplish that goal. We will see river fed glacier diminishing year after year till they run dry. This means unpredictable level of confusion and chaos in regions that are heavily dependent on those rivers, such as Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Sarda in India: Yangtzi, and Yellow river in China: Indus River in Pakistan. These are the bread baskets of the planet and nearly 2 billion people depend on them for crop cultivation. In addition, desertification will threaten many parts of the world due to increasing temperatures and diminishing rainfall. In places, such as the Middle East, this will further destabilizing the already volatile region and could possibly lead to military confrontation over water resources. California Central Valley, which produces 25% of food consumed by the Americans will face sever droughts and this means soaring food prices. Substantial number of people from Mexico and Central America will try to enter the U.S. African nations will see the full wrath of climate change and global warming, causing an increase in failing and failed states. Global cooperation and trade will collapse due to increased number of refugees and scarce resources. Radical groups may gain popularity and cause civil wars. Eco terrorist groups will sabotage government institutions in their desperate measures to stop fossil fuel consumption.

Proponents of climate change don't pretend there aren't places getting colder. You claimed you read all the articles and yet you seem surprised by the information that you would find in these articles... I really don't think you have the level of understanding you think you have. \n\nClimate change predicts more extreme weather - colder in places and hotter in others. For example, a link was established between warmer artic temperatures and colder North American winters. As the artic warms, North America cools, but along with that come much harsher storms, which bring tornadoes, flooding and so on. (storms are caused by warm air meeting cold air, if you have even warmer air meeting even colder air, you get more extreme storms).\n\nYou really should actually read up on what the climate change hypothesis says if you're going to claim it's wrong. At the moment you seem to be arguing against an inaccurate caricature of the science.\n\nYou ignored both of my questions, which makes it difficult to have any sort of proper discussion.

CNN and the rest of the bullshit news outlets here are still stuck on the planet turning into an oven, all the polar regions will melt, flooding coastal cities, people moving having to move to the mountains , cats and dogs cohabitating etc etc. So your one of the few I've heard saying the heating and cooling will be more extreme, storms will be worse. What are you looking at that says they are more intense? How do they know storms were not more intense from 1400 to 1500 ,for example, or at any time before the thermometer? Hasn't the earth's climate always been changing?  Let's take a look at Cat 5 Hurricanes.  8 were recorded from 1924 to 1974. Next 47  years 10 were recorded.

{"cid": "UgwOuAY_NuRYF5PVLeZ4AaABAg.93Xf3qhVY1I9PIa0jOEY8Q", "text": " @Brett Grove  it seems to me that your understanding of the science is based on what you've seen on the news -  a very basic layman's understanding. News outlets are notoriously bad at explaining science, because they aren't scientists. If I'm one of the few you have encountered saying that the earth is both heating and cooling, you can't have read much on the subject. You have to try to understand that you really don't actually know much about this subject - your lack of knowledge is actually making you massively overestimate how much you know. As the saying goes, you don't know what you don't know. \n\nHere is one of a million articles that can explain it to you:\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/01/30/this-is-why-global-warming-is-responsible-for-freezing-temperatures-across-the-usa/?sh=617cf61ad8cf\n\nAs to why it was called global warming and then changed to climate change... it's a bit like why the big bang is called the big bang when there was no bang - the media like to coin a snappy phrase, and the original phrase seemed to be causing confusion so it was changed to try to help confuse people less. In addition, science is evolving - we don't necessarily understand everything about something immediately (especially something like climate - we have a ton of satellites, lots of data and experts, and we still can't always tell you what the weather will be like tomorrow). When they originally realised the planet was warming up extra fast, they didn't necessarily understand how that would affect the gulf stream. Basically, some one said \"oh shit guys, we have a problem, the planet is warming too fast\" and then later they realised it was having this other effect of cooling some places too. We improve our understanding with new information. \n\nI like that you have tried to find some data that would confirm or deny the storm issue, but don't you think that people have probably done much more in-depth studies? Because they really, really have. There are meta analyses out there you could read but frankly they would be too specialised for either of us to understand because we don't have the relevant expertise. This is complex stuff. \n\nAnyway, as I have pointed out several times, our amateur discussions are completely pointless.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "drummingtildeath", "channel": "UCTjBnZMDuq01I5Jz5oK7xmg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQgwVKKGqS9YlepX6uT0emSTuZne14NPy5AwQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The costs of intervening we already pay. We currently pay the FF industry $5.3 trillion a year in taxpayer funded billionaire welfare \"subsidies\" to cause AGW. The cost of addressing AGW according to Bloomberg would require a $12.1 trillion INVESTMENT not handouts, over 25 years. Or 10% of the FF subsidies. The current price of intervention we pay. Poor countries have far less emissions per person thus much less scope to cut emissions and are also the most effected by AGW. Also are reducing emissions as only 2 countries didn't sign up to Paris, one at war the other the US. So the Us pulled out of a meaningless agreement which deniers demand the US pull out of!!! LOL. So how is paying less for cheaper cleaner RE, no more wars for oil, cleaner air and water, creating jobs and lower taxes \"killing capitalism\"?

It might harm it but the cost of artificially stopping emissions is much more costly compared to the immediate benefits than it would be if technology naturally advances to the point were we'd be using reliable energy sources, cause we have to move on either way, oil is not a renewable resource.\nAs for the other arguments I haven't looked through the sources but I'm sure Ben isn't denying EVIDENCE and hasn't been lying, he has said before and has repeated that he would take any new evidence into account when he becomes aware of it. Thus his opinions are subject to change based on new facts.\nAnyway if you believe he is unaware of these facts I would love to hear from you on his show or just here in the comment section.

Second, can a European like me join in on this topic? The argument I want to bring is here in the country I live (Belgium) climate change is handled wrong. Climate change is huge that's a fact. The curve shows that there hasn't been a change for at least 400 years up until the industrial revolution (which I think is one of the worst event in history) and it led to a huge raise in temperature. A problem we have here and I'm assuming it's the case in America to is, everyone on the left here wants to become 100% green by 2025. Nuclear power has to dissappear and the expenses aren't important. 1 huge thing this caused is that we got a lot of extra debt because the government here started giving 1500 euros when you buy solar panels and no one remembers electricity bills will skyrocket when we shut down all our nuclear reactors. So in conclusion the point I'm trying to make is the left wants to go to fast because we unfortunately can't afford to change to green in 10 years but they don't want to acknowledge that. Again idk if this is the case in the US but if it's somewhat similar I hope it's a decent argument. 1 big difference between the US and Belgium I've seen is that the right here acknowledges climate change way more than in the US so keep that in mind.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Nicola Sabbe", "channel": "UCmoVm0e7zsTQ7vqb8OebK0w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQS1xPvvW0dAV25LMPQALm_X71UreHgNaRh_JA1oQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The costs of intervening we already pay. We currently pay the FF industry $5.3 trillion a year in taxpayer funded billionaire welfare \"subsidies\" to cause AGW. The cost of addressing AGW according to Bloomberg would require a $12.1 trillion INVESTMENT not handouts, over 25 years. Or 10% of the FF subsidies. The current price of intervention we pay. Poor countries have far less emissions per person thus much less scope to cut emissions and are also the most effected by AGW. Also are reducing emissions as only 2 countries didn't sign up to Paris, one at war the other the US. So the Us pulled out of a meaningless agreement which deniers demand the US pull out of!!! LOL. So how is paying less for cheaper cleaner RE, no more wars for oil, cleaner air and water, creating jobs and lower taxes \"killing capitalism\"?

That is he rarely debates but instead makes a speech then gets asked a 30 second question, then he gets to make another unlimited speech uncorrected, with as many lies and his financial backers pre-prepared BS talking points as he can muster. Ben talks fast because it's a debate tactic. And that tactic is to baffle you with BS and lie as much and as fast as he can and overwhelm you with so many lies and 1/2 truths.  For example in the first minute or so he lies about models overestimating temp rise when observed actually falls in the middle of model runs. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.realclimate.org/images/cmp_cmip3_sat_ann.png\r\n\r\n\r\nTo efficiently debunk this first series of claims takes quite awhile and can get quite technical.

Secondly, NO! there will be a huge ass death toll before people start evolving or migrate. The rise in the number of natural calamities kill people too!

Capitalism is and always will be responsible for this because we don't have Socialism or any other political system in any place. Let's face it, the countries that call themselves Socialists aren't anywhere close to it. When the entire economic system depends only on profit disregarding what might be sacrificed in the pursuit of it, then yes Capitalism must be fucking blamed.

You're aware that we're cutting trees at astounding rates, right?

To claim otherwise is completely fallacious. \n\n\nAll that said though, the fact remains that there isn't some global conspiracy to create a fake climate crisis: scientists across the globe have come to the same conclusions based on the evidence they've collected--and I'd strongly suggest actually reading the peer reviewed papers before enterprising them.

I completely avoid pork and virtually all chicken meat and eggs now - I only buy stuff I'm certain is free-range.

We're burning through fossil fuels (which industrial agriculture heavily relies on), at such a rate that the question is not whether we're going to completely deplete them or irretrievably ruin the planet, but which will come first.\nIt's rather bizarre to submit that the very traits that have made us so utterly destructive, are proof of our superiority.\nI'm sorry, but your arguments are the exact sort of lunatic fringe arguments that discredit science, conservation, and sustainability.\nYou're damaging the credibility of people who spend their entire careers trying to fix the mess that our species has made.\nIf you really want to help, start listening to people who're actually doing something. Read a few articles by Dr Gerhard Verdoorn, for example. He's contributed massively to conservation in South Africa, particularly bird conservation. He's also a hunter. Not only is there not a contradiction, the two go hand in hand.\nIf you don't go into wilderness, you don't appreciate it.\nYou don't have to go hunting with a weapon. Stalking gemsbok with a camera, or a sketchpad, or just with all your senses fully alive, and seeing how close you can come to those beautiful, skittish, dangerous grey ghosts before they spook is to become so much more intent on protecting them than sitting in front of your TV in your 500 sq foot McMansion, chowing down on a Buddha bowl, and then practising yoga very badly before drinking poorly-made green tea (hint, boiling water is a huge mistake).", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Dave F", "channel": "UCucUw5pYv8_b3wfp_lMtUxQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRmz4ChDg2t-0veU81qaMQRSPCAReFgFTmYEWKReg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And even more unlikely that the vast majority will ever be able to reach a population of which they could be removed from the need of conservation. Instead ask your self why we need conservation in the first place? Maybe because what we do isn’t sustainable. Like I’ve stated no meat is sustainable when you consume the amity we do as humans. We don’t have the land, it’s either built on, desolate or farmed. Look at any reports into sustainability and you’ll find that it isn’t, just because the fancy label says it is doesn’t make it so.\n\nThe dr you mention does have an invested interest though, without the birds or animals he like to hunt, where else will he get his kicks.\nYou make to many assumptions, why can’t you keep into the discussion in hand rather than going on a personal attack about green tea and yoga.

{"cid": "UgzUY3Ii7ASivoc_oWt4AaABAg", "text": "I hope my comment starts a civilized conversation. With that said, Ben Shapiro answered a difficult question. As he stated, most scientists are in agreement that the earth is warming and human beings have major influence. Yet I would have hoped that he elaborated a bit more on the effects of mass migration. He barely touched upon that subject. I would like to argue that mass migration is the most important issue that will arise. Given that mass migration causes disease, famine, and violence; policies concerning climate change should be seriously taken into consideration. Furthermore, the developing countries’ refusal to abide by policies should not mean we should not try to do anything to preven—or slow down—climate change. The fact that many people already migrate to the U.S should elucidate my point further. These migration numbers will increase significantly. As a matter of fact, there already are islands that are disappearing. Therefore, what solutions can we (as a species) implement to combat climate change responsibly, humanely, and effectively?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Adrian Hernandez", "channel": "UCDxkIgtK97c_a6aJDUGGBDg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGYWJN0e6wwO16xAhpkUjOM0DkH8U0Enu3Hg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The answer is still simple. A different opinion is worthless if not backed by evidence so denier opinion is thus worthless. You can be of the opinion you can fly off a cliff. Try it.

We don't have resources for large scale technology change. Take an average solar panel and figure out the cost it would take to replace your entire country's electric grid and power supply, its implausible, what is more implausible is we probably don't have enough materials for it also. \nSolar panels are incredibly inefficient. Just because you have a theoretical model doesn't mean its fit for consumerism, solar energy, \"free energy\" is selling now because it is currently good enough for consumerism. This is the growth of technology. \nA similar example is a computer, it was also a 1800 invention, a commercial computer only came in late 1900s near 2000s, nearly 2 centuries. And now you have it in your hand. THIS is called progression of technology. Renewable energy is still very young and still very inefficient. \n\nThe same is the issue with wind power. \n\nOnly real solution is nuclear, but people heavily protested against it, even though it's the best source of long term power and sustainable too, truly sustainable unlike solar panels. People didn't want it cause \"EXPLOSION\" they were scared, so they protested, now they don't like climate change, they are scared now they are protesting. \n\nMost industries which is the back bone of any economy and the entire country as a whole, operate on coal, go figure out the cost to change into an electric system. These are real challenges that no climate activists want to tackle. It never happened cause it is not plausible, even though its \"free energy\".  \n\nSo your argument that technology is not how you create solutions is absolute bollocks. \n\nThe reason coal is still used, because it is the most sustainable way of creating heat, hence power. It might be a problematic source of pollution but it is also the reason why you are able to rant about it on internet in the first place, most of the things you see around you, comes from fossil fuel mining.

Why? For several reasons including the one you admitted. People don’t want it, so it won’t happen. Secondly is it takes too long, 30+ years, from conception to completion. This is too long to address the problems of AGW, thus a strawman non-solution heavily promoted by the FF industry to string out their dying industry as long as possible and enable them to pollute without taking any personal responsibility for those actions and keep leaching that $5.3 trillion a year subsidy gravy train from taxpayers. Thirdly the most expensive, subsidised form of generation. That is why they are not being built and being cancelled and shutdown instead. Fourthly the cost and problems of nuc waste.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Most industries which is the back bone of any economy and the entire country as a whole, operate on coal, go figure out the cost to change into an electric system” As demonstrated, done and found RE to be the cheapest solution.. These are real challenges and reality that no climate denial activists want to tackle so they lie or hide from.\n\n\r\n\r\nNahh ahh is not an argument in anybody’s book but the sole “argument” from deniers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“So your argument that technology is not how you create solutions is absolute bollocks.” Never said that so that is absolute bollocks.

It is sustainable because we have more than enough NU material, we can create more if we need to, and the rest of the material is mostly concrete and steel which we have an abundance of. As for NU waste, modern NU engines are more efficient, they run for more and produce less waste and with NU fusion their won't be any waste.

Also, if you're not actually pushing an agenda, you wouldn't use a bullshit argument of using LCOE for RE but then in the same sentence call Nuc costly. If you didn't know there's a lot of companies resisting, and most of this push is actually spearheaded by activists and is political, I have explained this in like in my first few comments. The Nuc argument is also explained thoroughly. Activists are allergic to reading. So nice try goldfish. \n\n3. Again, read your own sources, LCOE again? That's not what cost means, also, not to mention the graph take into account only 10 years, Nuc at best can last 100 years. Calculate the LCOE for that please and add to that bullshit argument, Nuc is taxed to oblivion while Solar is subsidized in many places. Solar is pushed while Nuc is resisted, that you for proving my point again. \nComputer rebuilt? You mean maintenance and basic software upgrades? LOL. Go on. \nDecommissioning like what is going to happen after you finish your life cycle is any scenario? Even in RE? Funny.\nNuclear waste which is stored away securely and a very little amount is produced over its entire life cycle? That waste? Btw all of this is calculated in the LCOE (the one that you love to use) of Nuc plants. Activism mode turned ON didn't it? LOL.  🤣🤣🤣Also that waste can be reused also. \n\n10 years ago? Nope. Also who fuck uses Wikipedia as an argument? First you raise taxes and regulations then complain it's costly, what a game. 🤣🤣 You want to discuss US, let's actually discuss the world. \n\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/projected-costs-of-generating-electricity-2020\n\nnuclear has THE LOWEST ACTUAL LCOE COST, at 32usd/MWh and Wind and Solar at, 88usd/MWh and 56usd/MWh respectively. The actual costs differ because of politics, not cause it's actually costly. \nSo take that US amount and reduce it to 60% average. \n\nSome nonsense. \n\nStraw man? This is what happens when people don't understand science, they are PART of the process, either all comes out or nothing does. So you WILL produce FF regardless of what you feel about it. I never said the same for Nuc but nice joke. \nAlso, your idol, \"how dare you\" 's argument is to ban ALL FF. You have said the same, and you also used the apocalypse argument. \n\nNow that's called a Straw man, Actually at this point after so much time you're saying this, after repeating so much, then it's a blatant lie. \nMy statement, \"Cars took over horses, not when the technology came but when it actually had benefits over horses, also it happened eventually. Good example. This also needs to happen eventually, not abruptly.\" \"Solar is good, nuclear is better and sustainable\"\nYour comprehension, \"Bla bla FF talking point technology will improve as the FF want it., denier\" Really an interesting species you are. \n\n\n\"Denier\" Facts that you can't read.\nOh yes, cause increasing taxes and regulation all the while organizing rallies and misinformation campaigns around Nuc is scientific. Terrific analysis.  \nYour point Solar is cheaper and sustainable, it's a lie but scientific....Sure buddy. \n\nKid, I don't know what your age is but I have Heard 3 different apocalypse story, call me when the earth is destroyed, until then don't waste my time. Also, try to understand basic concepts like price, efficiency, facts and feelings. Learn the basics first then jump onto the apocalypse bandwagon. \n\nCoal Miners don't use rare earths to mine coal, the only thing in there that uses rare earths is computers, unlike  Solar which uses rare earths for production. So your argument is what ban computers? You will run out of rare earths building sub par solar panels,( also china builds most of them so they are definitely sub par in more ways than one) not by building computers.\nAlso, FF IS EFFICIENT AND CHEAP that is why poor countries uses and prefers this. Solar is not as explained. \n\nAnd we have nuclear fusion, due 2025, a perfect energy source, but we are not discussing that, are we? \n\nAbout your comment on fixing the coal, I made a comment about fixing solar panel not fixing sunlight. What a moron. 🤦‍♂️ Also, like explained, coal will be dug, regardless of whether you use it or not.  \nIt is not cheaper, LCOE doesn't equal to price. Also, you would be digging rare earth's as well? Is that cheaper? Manufacturing of RE, is that cheaper? What part is cheaper, exactly? \n*Also, here again complaining about digging up the coal then making a point(lying) that you don't want ALL FF industries to shut down. \n\nYour argument, that RE is cheaper, powerful and sustainable yet companies which are designed to make money don't use it but you still go on, proves your ignorance on the topic. Understand what LCOE actually means. \n\nIt can be however damaged by bad weather, sudden impact, environmental conditions and even animal attacks, point being if it breaks, it breaks, you have to replace it. A traditional combustion engine is way more sturdy because of its build despite moving parts, and yes a lot of old engines work especially in a rough and tough environment in comparison to the safely guarded system of a massive scientific institution. \n\nWrong, and it doesn't apply, coal is already used and Nuc is used in the same way, the power generation with these are so high it can supply a city from pretty far away, Solar can't do that, wind can't do that. Not enough wind in your ENTIRE LANDMASS?? No wind power for you. TOO LONG OF A MONSOON SEASON or TOO CLOUDY OR SNOWY A REGION??? No solar for you. This is how it works, not the way you think it does. \n\nSo same old, same old.", "time": "1 month ago (edited)", "author": "Ricky Cool", "channel": "UCYBeBtYY2C3VxemTlcYXbcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTNoNABrdBCPGEFb6Xh03xKq5XfZFs47gva3ZNiSZY=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'm quite conservative and were very sceptical about climate change. Or at least about which role humans play in it. And even so I disliked the idea, I couldn't be sure if I was really right about my point of view. Neither could I tell if the opinions spreaded in media and by people were valid. However, there is one thing I trust and that is science. Which has to do with the fact, that all our technology and society is build on it. So I decided to do my own reading on the topic and got into all the popular scientific studies on climate change myself. I guess by my comment before, you can already tell whats my conclusion. However, i'm a strong believer in freedom of speech and I won't tell you what to think. But if you are also interested in questioning your own thoughts and ideas on climate change, please feel free to visit the following website. A lot of claims against human made climate change are discussed there. You will find links to all mentioned studies.

Not one person called or emailed at that voting precinct of being intimidated and not only that, the number of people who voted at that specific voting precinct increased dramatically from the previous presidential election. The Obama Administration got an injunction on them based upon the video so they actually did something and got got what they could because to prove voter intimidation you need a complaint or evidence that it effected voter turnout and they had neither. Just because a black man looks scary and may have tried to intimidate (and is a horrible person) doesn't mean they broke the law and that's why the Obama Administration was lucky to even get an injunction against them and it's why the Bush Administration dropped the case in the first place. You can say \"Of course people didn't complain, they were too scared.\" It is possible for that to be true but in a court of law hypotheticals don't apply.

There's a reason why air pollution engineers are employed to deal with air pollution, and not podcast hosts. If you honestly think that it's a good idea to hire Ben Shapiro to calculate the quantitative effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere, then that's on you. Might as well hire him to design a rocket engine and a particle accelerator while you're at it, or hire me to be a lawyer or host a podcast. Formal education exists for a reason. \r\n\r\nBut that's all besides the point. I never said that I'm correct and Shapiro is wrong because I have a relevant degree and he doesn't. He started off his own answer by saying \"I'm not a climatologist, but...\" He is fully aware that his views should not be regarded in the same light as that of climatologists, hence the disclaimer. That's the main reason why I started my comment by pointing out that he isn't a climatologist. \r\n\r\nNow if he had said something that demonstrated \"the validity and relevance of the premises used to support its conclusions\" then I wouldn't have had a problem with it, but instead he was literally unaware of about half a dozen effects of climate change which are readily available to anyone that is willing to do enough research. Like I said, he only lists rising sea levels and more frequent hurricanes as the destructive effects of rising temperatures. Those are not the only two effects, and it doesn't take a degree in air pollution to find reports on that. I suggest you do a Google search of each of the things that I listed if you don't believe me. You talk about reports being accessible to the public, and about not needing degrees to understand them. Then go ahead and actually read the reports. Don't just depend on a political podcast host to spoonfeed the information to you, and blindly bash anyone that provides counter evidence. \r\n\r\nI have no issue with listening to non-climatologists that actually demonstrate an in-depth understanding of climatology.

My mentioning that he was not a climatologist was NOT my main argument, that was something that he stated AND a conclusion I drew because of his lack of knowledge on the topic. \n\nIf you say that license and ad hominem have no place in a serious debate then why were you asking for my license or focusing on myself this whole time rather than my argument? You opened this can of worms yourself and now you’re telling me that you’re above that kind of conduct. Please. You attacked my character first. \n\nI’ve been waiting..

I “presented flaws in his argument”. If you refuse to believe me or merely fact check me, then your ignorance is to blame, not me. And this is the frustrating predicament that scientists, especially climatologists, have to deal with: trying to educate adults that refuse to listen AND refuse to look at the data. If you refuse to do either then you’re a closed system. You’ve made up your mind and nothing will change it. If you’re wrong, then you’ll stay wrong forever. \n\nThis will likely be my last comment. I was hoping for a reasonable debate on climate change but you’re just going to attack me and defend Ben, no matter what evidence I bring and have brought to the table. This is pointless.

Your equivocation that all Christians are fundamentalists is incorrect. I am pretty confident that evolution is a well researched biological phenomena. Some Christians that struggle to accept evolution as a casual biological phenomenon is not due to not accepting the science but, all have to do with dogmatic theological Hermeneutics that churches require their attendants to believe. The theological dogma usually is due to the hermeneutics of the first couple chapters of Genesis. Which sadly the average Christian most likely has the incorrect interpretation. \n\nThere are actually two separate creation accounts in Genesis Ch.1 and Ch.2. both accounts are actually different from one another due to differences in style, scope, and organization of the two chapters. The two creation accounts also have different literary styles, scope, and organizational principles. Genesis 1 describes the creation of the entire cosmos (heaven and earth) over six days, with repetition and patterning, climaxing with God’s rest on the seventh day. By contrast, Genesis 2 (the first chapter of the Garden story) is more straightforwardly a narrative in the formal sense, with a series of tensions and resolutions. And in contrast to the wide-angle view of Genesis 1, which surveys the cosmos as a whole, Genesis 2 zooms in telescopically on humanity on the earth. While some Christians often think of the first humans as a primordial couple, we need to balance the picture in Genesis 2 with that of Genesis 1, where God creates not individuals, but population groups to fill various niches—including flying creatures in the sky, swimming things in the water, and then on the land both animals and humans (the latter designated by the collective noun ’adam). Christians only read this account of human creation as an original couple because we RETROJECT the account from Genesis 2 back into chapter 1. But we need to respect the different portrayals of creation in each account. Even in Genesis 2, the initial pair that God creates are described as “the human” (ha’adam) and “the woman” (ha’iššâ). “Adam” becomes a proper name only in the genealogy of Gen 5:1 and “Eve” is the name given to the woman in Gen 3:20. These names are clearly symbolic, since the name of the first man is “Human” (’adam) and the name of the first woman (havvâ) sounds like the Hebrew for “Life.”", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Boaz Reid", "channel": "UCgs6vMVwgoVEm6YhA4RCHnQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTF1P_d4DTmjEICyNqo2o4GQYndl-x7tKPXiSQE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Try again next time. \"\n\nUnfortunately, I disagree. I don't think you want a genuine dialogue by your juvenile condescending remark of \"Try again next time.\"\n\nIt appears you also have an incorrect interpretation of the bible as well. The book of Genesis includes two very different creation stories. The first, “Genesis 1” runs from verse 1:1 to the middle of 2:4 (2:4a). The second, “Genesis 2,” runs from verse 2:4b to 2:25. Beginning in the 18th century, European Old Testament scholars discussed this point in earnest. The next two centuries brought the discovery of numerous creation stories from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Canaan. With the discovery of these creation stories, scholars could now see clear evidence to support a nonliteral reading of the Genesis texts, since each biblical story shares characteristics of different Near Eastern stories. the ancient Jewish interpreter Philo of Alexandria (20 BC to AD 50) understood Genesis 1 and 2 to be contradictory. This was not a problem for Philo, however. Rather, it signaled to him that the two stories were not meant to be understood historically. God meant them to be understood as pointing to realities deeper than the merely historical. The two creation stories are not saying the “same thing,” nor does Genesis 2 follow chronologically from Genesis 1. They are two distinct stories of creation, both in terms of content and order. They cannot be harmonized—they were never intended to be. Genesis 1 speaks of the mass creation of humans (male and female) at one time by the collective noun ’adam. Genesis 2 begins with one man, then one woman from the man in a separate act. The difference in vocabulary reflects the difference in perspective. \n\nClearly, Genesis chapters 1 and 2 are separate accounts. It appears that your interpretation is as dubious as that of a fundamentalist.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Boaz Reid", "channel": "UCgs6vMVwgoVEm6YhA4RCHnQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTF1P_d4DTmjEICyNqo2o4GQYndl-x7tKPXiSQE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Since your statement is reliant on circular reasoning there's no reason to believe the statement is true. What a sloppy talking-point on your end. \n\n\" The bible, for example, is not proof of the existance of God. It assume the existance of God. \" \n\nNo one said this... This is a strawman talking-point. Science also relies on assumptions as well. The process of building scientific knowledge relies on a few basic assumptions that are worth acknowledging. Science operates on the assumptions.\r Assumption (#1) There are natural causes for things that happen in the world around us. For example, if a ball falls to the ground, science assumes that there must be a natural explanation for why the ball moves downward once released. Right now, scientists can describe gravity in great detail, but exactly what gravity is remains elusive. Still, science assumes that there is an explanation for gravity that relies on natural causes, just as there is for everything in nature. Assumption (#2) Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes. Science assumes that we can learn about gravity and why a ball falls by studying evidence from the natural world. Scientists can perform experiments with other falling objects, observe how gravity affects the orbits of the planets, etc. Evidence from a wide range of experiments and observations helps scientists understand more about the natural causes of gravity.\r Assumption (#3) There is consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world. In other words, the same causes come into play in related situations and these causes are predictable. For example, science assumes that the gravitational forces at work on a falling ball are related to those at work on other falling objects. It is further assumed that the workings of gravity don't change from moment to moment and object to object in unpredictable ways. Hence, what we learn about gravity today by studying falling balls can also be used to understand, for example, modern satellite orbits, the formation of the moon in the distant past, and the movements of the planets and stars in the future, because the same natural cause is at work regardless of when and where things happen.

Funding tech to clean up our act and getting the world to follow is my hope.I have donated money to organizations that specifically try to fix an issue just in case you were wondering if I was putting the burden on everyone else. I have only been able to fund ocean cleaning projects cuz agriculture is very weedy and I dont know where to start for cleaner fuels. I curb my own habits and reduce plastics ect.

Somewhere around 10-13 billion years ago . \n2 volcanos are the natural sources of emmiting co2 in atmosphere in large quantities . But its important to Maintain that level of co2 in atmosphere cause it traps heat in the atmosphere and we get habitable temperature conditions . And thats the reason why earth has been surviving all these times . For ex - look at mars , its also in habitable zone of solar system but once all active volcanoes on mars went dead Planet froze died as all the heat it was gaining by solar radiation could not be trapped and atmosphere became soo thin it eventually lost all the climate . \n3 you are saying all the global warming is caused by nature itself and its just leftist agenda to glorify this issue . First green house gases are 1. Water vapour , 2. Co2 , 3. Methane ,4. Hydrocarbons , 5 chlorofluorocarbons (cfc's)  these gases are responsible for trapping heat into atmosphere . Where co2 , water vapour and cf's play major role in that and cause almost 99% of warming \n4. Co2 from thermal power generation plants , plesticides manufacturing plants , vehicles , fabric manufacturers , and many more emmiting not millions , but hundreds of billions of tonnes of co2 and no2 into atmosphere . If you can quick google on Wikipedia youll come to know USA IS ranked 1 on co2 emissions followed china and then india .\nAll this gases are thickening our atmosphere and Trapping more heat that resulting into raise in avg global temperature . sure , where you live avg temp might vary 18-22 degree Celsius . And resulting 2 degree raise in temp would go upto 27-28 °c for Ambient air temperature . Thats still survivable . But think about places where avg temp is 35 °c . For ex - india . This raise in temp has resulted into 40-41 degree Celsius and or some places its hovering near 50°© . \nThe coldest place on earth are polar regions . And we are melting polar caps that are present there , that means imagine the temp hike near equator and other places , \nI heard ben Shapiro suggesting building flood walls near coast to cope with rising sea level .thats the most childish and unscientific statement i have ever heard . As 78 % of planet is covered by sea , rise in one inch over it is tremendous amount of water , (just calculate surface area and multiply it by volume youll get some trillion of gallon of water amount) . And this water level hike will also affect cyclone surge during landfall by great amount . Put out your right or left lable aside for a while and think as a human specie , we have only 1 home \"earth\" if something happens to it by our own actions , we will be responsible for our own extinction .and no issue right now is important than that . \nAnd some personal advice for you - when doing research online use some credible sources , not some third party channels with rightist or leftist agenda instead use nasa or nat geo or google or wmo data , cause they are actually have satellites that are studying Atmosphere since 50 years . And one thing when you are debating on scientific topics dont include left and right . science doesnt discriminate .", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "wind surfer", "channel": "UCiztMxlkNPqu-4HztzU8Xfw", "votes": "11", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZ0xD-PdmhRLkwjvNTfIXHT8HHQDOH9k3OOw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Humans are emitting 100X the emissions of volcanoes and are thus effecting the climate more rapidly than volcanoes. Before humans started emitting 100 X that of volcanoes, the earth’s carbon cycle was basically in balance with sources about equal to sinks. Human emissions changed that balance.

So, I can explain in the most basic sense as to why the Earths climate has changed for millions of years. Talking about mere millenia is statistically insignificant compared to the Earth’s age. Over the span of millions of years solar activity, GHG concentrations, and volcanism. Each play a natural roll in the natural climate change of the Earth. This is widely documented by scientists. However, the issue currently is how much humans have accelerated the process. Even if humans went extinct, climate change will still occur. So unless you have a PhD in climate studies and have found alternative evidence to what I have stated above, then what I have said is true regarding current climate research.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ian C", "channel": "UCQete15D4N6f0RZ3bVMQtWA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRGyL4vogZSKySk75DTjFk4MDYMbDI61SrQQQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

CO2 absorbs long wave radiation. The Earth emits infrared radiation which GHGs, like CO2, absorb and reemit as heat in a directions. Essentially the energy from a photon is absorbed by CO2 causing the molecule to vibrate and collide with other molecules then releasing the energy. With this happening with so many molecules, the molecules gain speed causing a rise in temperature. The most significant GHGs are H2O, CO2, CH4, N2O, and O3. The strongest, or most potent, GHG is Sulfur Hexafluoride followed by HFC and CFC gases.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ian C", "channel": "UCQete15D4N6f0RZ3bVMQtWA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRGyL4vogZSKySk75DTjFk4MDYMbDI61SrQQQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However.. the real ramifications of climate change are biological. It has already put us into the 6th mass extinction,  with insects being hardest hit so far. That doesn't sound too bad until you realize that Insects include pollinators and one of every 4 bites we eat is from a flowering plant that requires pollinators. Every living thing depends on a whole chain of interactions and once you loose an important link in the chain, you get whole system failure. Im posting a link to a good, brief example of this, but what the article doesn't mention is how large frugjvores are mainly responsible for rainforest regeneration.

I live in India, where close to half a billion people are dependent on agriculture for income and the rest half billion for food(meaning that rain is very important).  For thousands of years, the climate has been steady, monsoons have come at the same time every year at the right time to produce the max amount of food. But recently, monsoons have become very unpredictable in terms of amount of water and pattern. Millions of farms have failed thanks to lack of rain or too much rain. If u ask families that have been farming for many many generations, they tell us that something is actually wrong. From the pattern of insects that act as pollinators to spread seeds naturally to rain required. There are too many pests and natural anti-pests have decreased so they have to use a lot of chemicals that might cause poisoning. Climate change does have actual ramifications across the world right now. Its just starting. and its gonna get much worse. Its a chain process where acid rain might kill small insects on the ground which reduces the number of natural pollinators so trees become less and less. therefore herbivores become less. food for carnivores and top of the food chain becomes less and including destroying of their natural habitat is upsetting the entire system that was stable for millions of years. We dont see it. phytoplankton produce half of earths oxygen. they are very small and live in the ocean. Now we all wear synthetic fibres. there micro-plastics when washed end up in the ocean and kill our major source of oxygen and we dont even know about it. Coral reefs are like the major cities and are the economic hub of the oceans. 80% of them are all dead. The entire  ocean ecosystem is changing.

Everyone who is a climate change denier and don't think humans are causing it are just uneducated and wrong. If you look throughout geological time, yes there has been warming, however that warming is due to things like  the earth moving on it's axis. \"Global Warming Has Begun\" was the article on the front page cover of the NYT in 1988, we have known about this problem for years and it's not just going to go away because you don't believe in it. Watch Our Planet & Blue Planet by David Attenborough, it's a great and interesting way to learn about how ecosystems are being effected on Earth. We are in the middle of the 6th mass extinction on earth and ecosystems are collapsing across the world due to habitat loss from warming and other human activities. If entire ecosystems collapse such as the oceans, then the \"economy\" doesn't really matter because the entire world will start to collapse. I don't know where you got that statistic about how \"95% of the CO2 emitted is from natural sources\" from because is just wrong, but even if it wasn't it doesn't make any point. Carbon is cycled though the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere every day in hugh quantities, and what humans are dong is ADDING CO2 TO THE CYCLE, so your bullshit percentages don't even show the full picture that the 95% of carbon from last year might be a fuck tonne more than the 95% of carbon today. No person who starts off an argument against human-caused climate change begins with \"I am a climate scientist\", and Ben Shapiro actually starts his argument off with the complete opposite because is doesn't know anything. The truth is out there man, and 98% of scientists agree that humans are warming the planet. If we fuck this up, then in 100 years you'll look back and think to yourself \"fuck, I was wrong, and now the planet is going to be fucked for 1000+ years, my bad, should have listened to the people that actually knew what they were talking about...\"", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Hugh Acton", "channel": "UCAqty97l-4yAfbLNgHelwIg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRslGnKTI82xxI1c05btKGWuIqlWv-7gXFvDw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Given the lack of sufficient volcanic data and research, and without considering seismic emissions, natural system emissions are estimated to be approximately 18.13–39.30 Gt CO2-eq per year, with a most likely value of 29.07 Gt CO2-eq per year. Hence, the total annual global GHG emissions range approximately between 54.26 and 75.43 Gt CO2-eq. The ratio of natural to anthropogenic emissions ranges between 0.5 and 1.09, with a most likely ratio of 0.8. This shows that anthropogenic and natural GHG emissions are of the same order of magnitude. Anthropogenic GHG emissions account for approximately 47.9%–66.6% of the total global GHG emissions, with a most likely value of 55.4% (Fig. 2). However, if the GHG emissions from volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are included, the natural GHG emissions are likely to exceed anthropogenic GHG emissions.\nAdvances in Climate Change Research\nVolume 9, Issue 4, December 2018, Pages 243-252\n\nEducate yourself kid, Ben was right.\nDo you have ethics to admit or will you continue to prove you don't don't believe in SCIENCE, just dogmatic ideologies PRETENDING to be science?\nWaiting, but not holding my breath.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "ethics first", "channel": "UCUJnmL3zuwe_lStb3hSpp4Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSKq6gxA3et0T0YVyWQZx8O9k-ks5qjZa80R-3r4MOiaSLs3fj3Fobh5a_sJim6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The costs of intervening we already pay. We currently pay the FF industry $5.3 trillion a year in taxpayer funded billionaire welfare \"subsidies\" to cause AGW. The cost of addressing AGW according to Bloomberg would require a $12.1 trillion INVESTMENT not handouts, over 25 years. Or 10% of the FF subsidies. The current price of intervention we pay. Poor countries have far less emissions per person thus much less scope to cut emissions and are also the most effected by AGW. Also are reducing emissions as only 2 countries didn't sign up to Paris, one at war the other the US. So the Us pulled out of a meaningless agreement which deniers demand the US pull out of!!! LOL.

The master of logical fallacy.\r\n\n\n\"...The water level is going to rise a rather predictable number of inches, or feet and then Humans will migrate based on those weather patterns...\"\r\n\nFallacy #1 - False dichotomy\r\nEither \"Terrible Catastrophe\" OR \"Sea Levels Rise, NBD...\"\r\nI'm pretty sure that there's a gray area here. Ecosystems that humans rely will be affected. Mass migration creates civil unrest, infrastructure can't always adapt quickly enough. There's potential for a significant death toll.\r\n\n\"Storms are becoming that more severe, they're doing that much more damage, the statistics really don't back that up. What they really back up is that we're just building more stuff in the path of hurricanes...\"\r\n\nFallacy #2 - False attribution\r\nThe dollar amount of damage caused by hurricane does not determine it's intensity.\r\nWhy would he cite statistics of damage cost? It's irrelevant. Do you really believe that the NOAA would measure the intensity of a storm based on the cost of damage? Storm intensity is based on it's energy output, and guess what? They are increasing in intensity.\r\n\n\"What level of climate change requires what level of cut-backs in terms of the global economy\"\r\nFallacy #3 - Loaded question\r\nQuestion contains the assertion that climate change solutions require cut-backs in the global economy.\r\nNot true. Economies can adapt and thrive to a new green market. Including developing countries.\r\n\n\"It's a complex issue and all the folks that are basically like, 'Let's just kill capitalism', good luck with that.\"\r\nFallacy #4 - Straw man\r\n\nAll those folks huh? All those imaginary folks in Ben's head that want to kill capitalism.\r\n\nYou can find logical issue with most of the stuff Ben Shapiro says.

Climate is changing and always has - we need to adapt as we always have\n\n\n2. Man contributes something to the change process - how much is not known because the models don’t match observations\n\n\n3. Trying to stop it is too expensive, we should work on adaptation as we have since all of history\n\n\n4. There is a political agenda to control people by controlling the air and water via money -  the whole issue has been hijacked\n\n\n5. Higher CO2 is likely to increase food production - PC incorrect to say this; also water vapour (eg. cloud) is the biggest influencer of climate (warmer = evaporation = clouds = reflection of heat -- thus self regulating)\n\n\n6. Warmer has been better for humanity historically\n\n\n7. Minimising pollution and wasteful consumption is a good thing, but not to the point of sending is back to caves.  Yes we should plant more trees, reduce our impact, invest in genuinely useful technology that reduces pollution, but stmopping plastic straws when China, India, the continent of Africa account for around 90% of the waste in the seas is pointless virtue signalling.\n\n\n8. The hypocritical hyperbole of the screaming left is not helpful, Using 16 year-old children to emotionally blackmail lies is beyond comprehensible\n\n\n9. Nuclear needs to be brought online as base load electricity\n\n\n10. Renewable are too expensive and represent a false economy (e.g. cost of a wind turbine vs its generated power, also the pollution cost in building a turbine [steel and other components]) - ditto electric cars; their total impact pollution is too great\n\n\nOur best strategy is adaptation (like always) with reasonable mitigation of pollution in general.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Kym in Adelaide", "channel": "UCp1ohTyGFBo-DUqum3uDgVw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlQSar9fn4B3sRS7aOm8ydGC56Le2ofFkJV70s=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Moral by definition means \"concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character\". By this we can both agree what's evil and what's good, what's bad or acceptable etc. On that standpoint, correct me if I'm wrong, as I searched up and read multiple accounts of atheists, they believe in personal value, somehow made by themselves and consider it to be labeled good and bad. We already know how fluid good and bad can be used, and how it is used to manipulate other people. You can tell a group of unborn children and raise them to do bad stuff, but label it good, and if that group grows to be a society, they will think that bad behavior that we find bad, is considered good. I'm not a Bible freak or atheist freak, but hearing atheists saying they have higher moral standards because they deem it to be that way is already biased and a logical fallacy. Also the Bible is a logical fallacy. I don't have a clear answer to what's really good and bad, but the only scriptures, laws, and moral documents over history is based off of Christian values. That's why I believe it is very hypocritical that atheist can somehow themselves, deem something as good or bad without even having a bases for it. We have common morals, but we shouldn't push obscure morals like gender fluidity, and vegan rights onto people. So really, I just thought why do atheist believe in morals? Even so if they are evolutionists shouldn't killing be a normal nature? How can we, randomly formed molecules somehow determine good and bad? How can we believe something without a base for it? Christians also have a problem too. They believe in God without tangible evidence, but it's a faith based system so I don't accuse them or tell them they are stupid. Atheist love making fun of religion and I can tell by Reddit posts and they don't hold back XD but really you really just can't say I have higher moral values.

But im not too sure about well being vs  biblical morality/ lawful morality. There are times where wellbeing is crucially important, and there are times where absolute morality is important. For example well being is either driven by emotional or physical needs. The need for sex or release of tension is good for the wellbeing, but the way you execute it might be far off of the common good and the social responsibility. Therefore, I think we can both agree on how many people are the result of their environment, and we all have different common goods and social responsibility, which makes it extremely hard to find a true unity in morals. And that's where law and absolute morals set it. It's strict, but also a good deciding factors of how we should handle situations. In this case, I can see atheists having morals, but it's also (just a view no judge) egotistical or one sided to think your moral is better than others without being able to disprove all of the morals. Like one side can say oh the Bible is pro slavery, but they can disprove it by the Bible's old language and also attack a moral standard you have of yourself. Superior morality does not exist because it's just a matter of opinion beyond what humans already established with an exception to common obvious morals we contribute to. This is a huge problem with culture, and imo I think people need to stop saying culture that, and make the culture excuse to do something obviously and visually obscene, such as Asians skinning dogs and batting them alive for \"better luck\" and \"tender meat\". That's why it's Soo hard to determine moral standards and to say your morality is better is... I wouldn't say ignorant, but more one sided? With morals everything factors in and we create our own, you can disagree with their morals but you can't hold yours any higher because ur not any better. But yes, I fully understand how atheists fit morality into their lives.

When water both makes up the majority of the earth's surface and is necessary to live, it really doesn't make sense to lose the ability to breathe under water. Considering that natural selection is the key driving-force behind evolution, with survival of the fittest being the goal, of what benefit is gaining the ability to drown? Maybe generations of ancestors avoided water at all costs so that it was no longer necessary? It's senseless in any context.\n\nThe cornerstone of evolution is based on a logical impossibility: giving what you don't have. All mutations result in either duplicate information (like an extra finger) or a loss of information (missing a limb). There are no mutations that add anything new to the genome. You'll never see a human born with a wing because no human has that information to pass down. All change is a scrambling of pre-existing information and the different combinations are what produces the variety we see. This process also inevitably leads to a loss of information with traits that are never passed down. We aren't getting more complex and diverse. We're losing it.

It's just naive and arrogant to assume we are the ones now all of a sudden \"creating\" a problem and we will \"fix\" it 🤣.

If the water rises, litteraly every costal town will either partially or completely be flooded. So instead of preventing that, he suggests people move when the land is no longer inhabitable? \n\nOrlando is predicted to be flooded by the rise of the sea level. They have 280 000 people there, also disney world and universal studios.  Where are you gonna put these people? Not to mention they can't exactly sell their homes, who would buy flooded homes? So climate change will make 280 000 people basically homeless and with no prospect. And that's just one town. If nyc is affected, you'd have 8 million people in need of new homes. Not to mention global economy would collapse if the city is submerged. \n\nAnd this just the us coast, the entire world would be affected by rising sea levels. \n\nIs taking drastic action economically profitable? Not initially, no. But down the line, it would absolutely be. \n\nThink of it this way. You're out of shape and some random guy comes at you with knife. Now, suddenly sprinting might make you extremely uncomfortable, you might feel dizzy, run out of breath, no one would argue that simply walking away will be more pleasant.

Keep them safe by the power of your NAME, the NAME you gave me, so that they may be ONE just as you and I are ONE. While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power of your NAME, the NAME you gave me.\" The New Testament, Revelation 1 Verse 7: \"Look!, He is coming on the CLOUDS!\" \"CLOUDS!\"/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\nThe Importance of WATER (Hydrogen2Oxygen) in The Holy Bible.\r\n1) Exodus 13 Verse 21: During the day the Lord went in front of them (Israel) in a pillar of CLOUD (WATER) to show them the way, and during the night He went in front of them in a pillar of FIRE (Hydrogen is FLAMMABLE) to give them light, so that they could travel night and day.\r\n2) Exodus 16 Verse 10: As Aaron spoke to the whole community, they turned towards the desert, and suddenly the dazzling light of the Lord appeared in a CLOUD (WATER).                                                                                                           3) Exodus 18 Verse 9: The Lord said to Moses, \"I will come to you in a thick CLOUD (WATER), so that the people will hear me speaking with you Moses, and they will believe you from now on.\"\r\n4) Exodus 24 Verses 15 to 18: Moses went up Mount Sinai, and a CLOUD (WATER) covered it. The dazzling light of the Lord's presence came down on the mountain. The CLOUD (WATER) covered the mountain for six days, and on the seventh day the Lord called Moses from the CLOUD (WATER). Moses went on up into the mountain into the CLOUD (WATER). There he stayed for forty days and forty nights.                                                                                                           5) Deuteronomy 18 Verses 16 to 18: The Lord said to Moses, \"On the day you were gathered at Mount Sinai (The Lord appeared in a thick CLOUD (WATER)), you begged not to hear the Lord speak again or to see his fiery presence any more, because you were afraid you would die. So the Lord said to me (Moses), 'They have made a wise request. I will send them a prophet like you from among their (Israel) own people; I will tell Him what to say, and He will tell the people everything I command. He will speak in my NAME, and I will punish anyone who refuses to obey Him.\r\n6) John 17 Verses 10,11 and 12: JESUS Pray to His Father YAHWEH, \"All I have is yours, and all you have is mine; and my glory is shown through them (Disciples). And now I AM coming to you; I AM no longer in the World, but they (Disciples) are in the World. Holy Father! Keep them (Disciples) safe by the power of your NAME, the NAME you gave ME, so that they (Disciples) may be ONE just as you and I are ONE. While I was with them (Disciples), I kept them (Disciples) safe by the power of your NAME, the NAME you gave me.\r\n7) Deuteronomy 28 Verse 12: He (Almighty God YAHWEH) will send RAIN (WATER) in season from His rich storehouse in the sky and bless all your work, so that you will lend to many Nations, but you will not have to borrow from any. Question to Muslims: Why are all Muslim Countries barren, dead, cursed and infertile DESERTS?\r\n8) John 19 Verse 34: One of the soldiers, however, plunged his spear into Jesus' side, and at once BLOOD and WATER poured out. (Saint Faustina Kawalska- Image of Divine Mercy).\r\n9) 1 John 5 Verses 6 to 12: The Witness about Jesus Christ: Jesus Christ is the one who came with the WATER of His Baptism and the BLOOD of His death. He came not only with the WATER, but with both the WATER and the BLOOD. And the Spirit Himself testifies that this is True, because the Spirit is TRUTH. There are three (3) Witnesses, the Spirit, the WATER, and the BLOOD, and all three (3) give the same testimony. We believe in man's testimony; but God's testimony is much stronger, and He has given this testimony about His Son. So whoever BELIEVES in the Son of God has this testimony written on his own Heart; but whoever does not believe God, has made Him out to be a liar, because he has not believed what God has said about His Son. The testimony is this: God has given us Eternal Life, and this Life has it's source in His Son. Whoever has the Son has this life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.\r\nZECHARIAH 14 Verse 9: Then the Lord will be KING over all the Earth; everyone will worship HIM as GOD and know HIM by the SAME NAME.\r\n\r\nGOD's NAME:\r\nJohn 17 Verses 11 and 12: JESUS was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane for his Disciples, \"HOLY FATHER! Keep them safe by the power of your NAME, the NAME you gave me, so that they may be one just as you and I are one. While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power of your NAME, the NAME you gave me.\"\r\n\r\nZECHARIAH 14 Verse 17: If any nation refuses to go and worship the Lord Almighty as KING, then RAIN (WATER) will not fall on their land. (All Muslim Countries have turned into barren, dead, desolate, cursed DESERTS because they refuse to Worship Our Lord JESUS Christ as KING).\r\n\r\nScientists say that the most abundant Element in the Universe is Hydrogen. The name \"Hydrogen\" was given to the Gas Element way back in 1783 by Antoine Lavoisier. The most Hydrogen is found in Stars and the Sun. Planets like Jupiter also have large percentages of Hydrogen.\r\nThe part that boggles my mind, is.. How did Saint Peter know that the heavenly bodies and the Earth was formed out of WATER 2000 Years ago? (H2o=Hydrogen2Oxygen/ 2 Peter 3 Verses 5 to 12) and by WATER (Holy Spirit/ 1 John 5 Verses 6 to 12). I mean, Saint Peter was only a fisherman and a Holy Disciple of JESUS. Saint Peter was no Scientist and he did not have any Telescope? How did Saint Peter know about \"heavenly bodies\" or planets made out of Hydrogen, an Element present in WATER?\r\nScientists, who actually many of whom are Atheists, are actually proving the Holy Bible to be True. The only way Saint Peter could've known these things 2000 years ago, is that Almighty God, the Holy Spirit of YAHWEH showed it to Him. The same Holy Spirit of the Father YAHWEH that was in Our Lord JESUS Christ.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod is more important nowadays than before.. Why?, because Climate Change is in The Holy Bible.\n///", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Jose Luis Borrageiro", "channel": "UCxTbTTipy7GmxMY-wu9j05Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQYdifp0eGYbte84q0jIJdHXaPpasDe0CVVcqL2=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There's no link here. \n\"It's not that hard.\"\nYou're making a positive assertion; it carries a burden of proof. You should be equipped to source a claim when made. I'm really interested to see a reputable source that confirms that all eight planets and moons are warming. And yes, I've heard this argument before; you're assertion is incorrect. I don't know what MIT article you referenced(since you didn't actually supply it), but the only one from MIT I came across discussed Pluto warming, not the \"whole solar system\". Here's a couple of links from reputable sources concerning the subject:\n\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/faq/14/is-the-sun-causing-global-warming/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/04/14/nasa-smacks-down-climate-change-doubters-in-facebook-discussion/%3foutputType=amp\n\nThe TSI has been lessening for about four decades(the NASA article linked above confirms this). So if you're implying that the sun is responsible for any warming of other orbiting bodies in the solar system, that's extremely unlikely. \nAnd btw, the Greta Thunberg, CNN, left wing media comments are obvious strawman arguments; that's fallacious and dishonest.

I told myself that you would double down and shift your goal posts from the original comment. I'm still waiting for that citation to confirm your \"WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM IS WARMING\" narrative. I fully accept that some planets and a moon are warming(Mars, Jupiter, Pluto, Earth, Triton). Now, you only need to confirm that Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth's moon, Titan, Ganymede, lo, Enceladus, Callisto, Europa, Iapetus, Charon, Mimas, Phobos, Dione, Tethys, etc. are also warming. There's over three hundred moons in the solar system so I won't list them all. Btw, it's dishonest to extrapolate that because five celestial bodies in the solar system are warming, that it logically follows that the hundreds of others are also. But for context, I'm setting the bar quite low for you and honesty. So will I get that citation on the next comment?

Arrogant and asinine, Ben depicts an exaggerated science fiction movie, goes on to cherry pick climate science all while dismissing the idea that climate change is due to human activity. Misunderstanding the information, Ben greatly underestimates the increasing threat of human induced climate change. Sadly Ben, it's not just a couple of inches of oceans rising, a few degrees hotter weather, and people moving over land. All life would be dramatically effected, most notably agriculture being destroyed by erratic extreme weather and thus reduced food yield. Plant die offs would also effect medicinal industry hard. The environment is so delicately balanced that once one thing goes, it makes it easier for other things to go and chain reactions take place. All industries would be hit hard because they generally all depend on the environment, it's a chain reaction.  The economy would suffer insurmountable damage so that economics guy you were talking about will need to find a new job. I could go on and on about the many disastrous consequences we know will occur if something isn't done to curtail human induced climate change sooner than later because at a certain point, it will be too late.

You're trying to argue real science with real science like you think i just make this shit up? No, i actually read a lot of the igpcc and they only DO look for examples of human caused climate change, and how to stop it. That is the intention of the IGPCc which is why scientists like fred hoyle, Robert baul, Timothy balling, anthony watts and many many others are still arguing with legitimate scientific facts that everyone ignores. This idea of climate change is an ideological topic. I dont know what you dont understand, probably the math, but during the younger dryas, the earth froze quickly, and melted even quicker. You probably dont understand what a 25° temperature drop globally would do. You probably dont know what a 19° centigrade rise in temperature would do. Its no lie, but only sheer fact that within 1 week, every coastline of the world saw a 450ft rise in sea level. Do you even realise that you would need an over 500ft tsunami to be able to rise sea level that much? The most devastating tsunami we have witnessed was the recent one in india, and it was only 5 ft. This is all published scientific material!peer reviewed but you arent bothering to look into it! Shut up and acutally read about a catastrophic climate event before you start shouting that we are experiencing one currently because you are only interested is sounding correct and holding the higher moral ground. Thats all  Democrats use climate change for is to sway people to think they are being better to the planet to get votes. Idiotic. Im over here talking about real science and you are arguing specifically a political narrative without actually looking into any actual science about it.

The problem is there is a major drop in temperature, followed by a massive rise in temperature in this crazy climate change scenario that correlates to a seemingly instantaneous extinction event that happened within our recent human history. There were cultures globally that felt and recorded its effects. Nobody is truly interested or informed on this unbelievable climate change scenario because we are all focused solely on fixing our contribution of a 0.0008% total of carbon into the atmosphere. I think its good for humans to want to clean up their act and start treating our home planet with the respect it deserves and needs to be able to support us and the rest of the natural life on it. I think its good to get onto a clean and renewable energy plan for the world, perhaps something like telsa had envisioned, which is now actually in function today in texas, by a company called viziv technologies. We need to clean up our pollution, which is a different problem than climate change, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, im sure you are well aware from any high school biology that carbon dioxide is what fuels plant growth, but coal plants in china release not only carbon into the atmosphere, but the biggest problem is the people breathing in particulate matter, excess by products from the process of turning the coal to energy.

Also, during the 50s and 60s US geological forest surveyors totaled all land biomass to get estimates on deforestation as a result of agriculture and were suprised to document that it was 20-45% greater than their previous assumptions. Where would you suggest we sustain the global PPM of carbon ( granted we had the capability of doing it correctly)? Carbon is not the issue imo, its more likely that it contributes to a more diverse biosphere on earth, than it does accelerate temperature increases. Just ask yourself, how could an increase of 1% or less carbon, influence a climate change reaction that causes mass extinction,  when there has been as much as 5 times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere than there is today, with more plentiful biodiversity surviving in a relatively peaceful and stable environment? That being said, its good to keep in mind that there are different forms of catastrophe, global vs local, most climate changes contrived from solely terrestrial sources tend to be local, like volcanos and hurricanes, earthquakes and stuff, but global climate change events almost never derive from forces acted within the planet itself. Thats why i mention the younger dryas also, because nowhere in there can you attribute that climate change event to local catastrophes, it was a global event and it was probably multiple instances of catastrophe occuring simultaneously, at least thats what the latest information is seeming to imply.

I think it would be smart to create a waste free clean energy grid, and there are cleaner and cheaper ways that all of humanity could do so. Idk if you are familiar with nikola tesla, but hed tried his entire life and ended up successful in creating a natural energy grid that harnesses earth energy and hydroelectricity to generate power that could be distributed globally, wirelessly and just using a tower or series of towers that he dubbed, the wardencliff tower. Alas, it never came to fruition because of greedy and dishonest people like JP morgan and Edison. Thankfully today, in 2019 there is a functioning (to my knowledge) 'model' of teslas tower in texas, located at a electricity company by the name of viziv technologies. They have been testing and researching this tech to see if they can bring it to the market, but hopefully, it potential is able to deconstruct the market and make life for everyone easier by generating world wide free power. Tesla was an extraordinary genius, has over 300 pattents and our technology derives mostly from his technological contributions, he also had basic plans to create anti gravity propulsion systems using the energy from the wardencliff towers hed planned to have globally. In theory, this would help eliminate combustion engines, which would result in less of an increase of fossil fuels. Then, we can focus on fixing our contribution to climate change since we wont be contributing to it as much. But there is a LOT of greedy people today and folks who dont want that to happen, that will prevent us from progressing. We have a lot to fix before dumping trillions of dollars into a mostly a nation wide decision to eliminate all carbon emissions by 2020. And quite frankly, im of the opinion that there is still an whole lot more to learn about the climate in general before we decide to go tweaking it. There is an undoubtable and overwhelming amount of (and you can fact check this if you dont go to nasa.gov\\climate,, and actually look at institutions researching this like the university of columbia, U.georgia and many others) published peer reviewed articles that suggest the end of the ice age resulted in major global catastrophe that resulted in the mass extinction of over 100 megafaunal and floral species WORLDWIDE. The scale of this scenario dwarfs this current climate change but we cant quite figure out what caused it. Some scientists have a decent idea of what it was but we cant be certain. But looking back in time at fossil records, ice core samples and what not just over the last 500,000 years, we see major catastrophes happening cyclically, on different scales in size but they are there and more common than previously imagined.

Chances are you are not. The theory of evolution has evidence to back it up, you don't.

Lets not forget we have a numerous other things such as cars, phones, internet, computer etc. All of this intelligence gained over a period of a couple hundred years. Imagine the stark contrast there must between humans from a thousand years ago.... a million years ago. What do you think about fossils of our ancestors that are strikingly different from current human morphology? They have features that closely resemble the morphology of other species. Clearly the human morphology has been gradually changing over long periods of time. What about DNA evidence that shows the shocking similarity between us and other species like apes?

It will be hell on Earth. The Church will be raptured, people will try to explain it away with alien abduction, since most people are more open minded to the existence of aliens than God. Then, God’s wrath will be poured out on the Earth for 7 years, to bring the Jewish nation of Israel to repentance- for they have rejected Jesus Christ. The Anti Christ, who will bring about the New World Order, One World Religion, One World Government and One World Currency will deceive many to take the Mark of the Beast (666) in their right hand or forehead. You cannot buy or sell without this mark, it will however corrupt your DNA thus making you no longer redeemable. He will come to bring “world peace”, after the world is almost destroyed- probably through nuclear warfare. But little do they know, that Jesus Christ will be coming back. The Anti Christ will preach this New Age Religion of “One-ness”, how all religions are true, and that all roads lead to Heaven. Sadly 98% of the world will probably fall for this deception. After all this ends, the world will be destroyed by FIRE. God promised He will never flood the Earth again with water, so don’t worry about that. God will end all pain, all tears, all suffering. And He will make a new planet. Stop wasting time and money on a planet that WILL be destroyed. Instead repent today, and be born again. Repentance is a change of mind- to know that you are wrong, and God is right. And then believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, was buried and bodily rose again on the 3rd day. THATS IT. Salvation is by faith ALONE, not trying to be a “good person”. Because if you have committed one sin, you have committed them all. I repeat, this planet is beyond being saved. The End is written. It is already finished. But don’t lose hope guys, God made a promise in His Word, and He says He will create a New Earth and New Heaven. Jesus wins in the end, even though right now it seems like Satan is, by deceiving many to reject the Bible, the Gospel and God. But God wins.

Of the gases that absorb infrared radiation in our atmosphere, CO2 and water vapor are the most prevalent (these gases are what keep the earth warm and without them the surface temperature would be close to zero degrees). So even though CO2 exists at  very small concentration in the atmosphere, it is one of the only gases that absorbs infrared radiation and changes the temperature. Both CO2 and water vapor are two of the major gases responsible for absorbing heat, but CO2 levels are changing at a much higher rate due to burning of fossil fuels. Does this answer your question?

Why would we continue fucking shit up just because of our love for capitalism?\n\nWe arent trying to wait til catastrophe hits to then say \"i told you so\" we know that there are measures we can take to mitigate the affects of climate change to provide us and our lineage more longevity in life because no matter at which rate climate changes and its affects we have to realize this rate of change starts to converge into what will be an uninhabitable planet aka mass extinction aka no more humanity and furthermore we will have family members that will live through it which if you cared at all for human life as a whole (which is crazy because i know a lot of pro lifers may not be for climate change) you would make at least the effort to make that difference but hypocrisy is a bitch when it all unfolds. Instead we got people like ben shapiro promoting any signs of mass extinction by means of saying hey since this wont have as bad an affect as people say (which is not definitively true but possible that we are even over estimating the affects) lets allow climate to continue changing at this rate. Lets allow this increased rate of climate change to hurdle this planet closer and faster to being uninhabitable and screw over our future due to self reflective motives of the present day. Because at the end of the day i only consider me and my own survival over everyone elses.\n\nAlthough i do get his point in terms of how if the affects arent as vast as people say the earth has been warming since the dawn of its time things change and thats just the natural course and we dont need to do things different and interrupt our systems when it isnt truly a dying need to do anything.\n\n But if we figure out there is something we can do lets do. And stop sitting on our asses and letting shit happen that doesnt need to happen due to corporate greed and capitalist incentives. Finding reason to not do something sounds a lot like an excuse to me.\n\nThis is a problem we should tackle beyond severity and thats bottom line. If capitalism gets in the way of that incentive well fuck it ... its a cons system anyway. It has benefits in terms of production but not in terms of quality living which to me is more valuable than just producing shit aimlessly all damn day just to say shits getting done. Then just promoting a 1% monopoly system that allows the rich to maintain their rich and the poor to work harder or just as hard to contribute to the success of the businesses and the flow of the system and feel like they are barely surviving or making ends meet (which is crazy because you would think to promote reputable business or a strong capitalist system you would like to vastly amount your consumers the chance to constantly spend time actually buying your products ... that cant happen if your main consumer doesnt have money to constantly spend which happens in capitalism specifically in the US, low to middle class the main consumers barely make ends meet. And whats worse is we say your value from just being born into this shit system is 0 dollars so good luck finding a way to indepndance financially you will most likely forever be indebt to society and forever depend on family finances (a lack of) to even try to get a job or a means of supporting uourself and your future or loans to get through life unless you make a break through discovery or marketing plan or something super ideal). \n\nCrazy how competitive capitalism is suppose to be yet we allow stupid ass systems like it to become luck based (being born intk money) and monopoly and exploit based advances. There is no competition in exploits or anything of that nature. Stuff like that ruins competitive integrity. Thats where capitalism fails as of rn.\n\nSo yes we can bypass shitty capitalism for the sake of ensuring a better quality future because the one thing that is evident is that there ARE measure we can take to positively affect our outlook on climate change.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Matthew Curiel", "channel": "UC9NWCaVeFqzM2tLd3sZjHxg", "votes": "12", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSYwIOH-APKe6rsSEqc9HR2RrQ74QnUAjEHOaf_-A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The reason money is so important is because society doesn't function without it. If the economy crashes, I can guarantee that there will be just as many problems as if we ignore climate change. My evidence behind scientists scaring public is all to do with funding. You do realise that if scientists report that the climate catastrophe is still 100 years away, they'd lose funding and be out of a job. Many of them we exaggerate to continue funding. This exaggeration has been scene in numerous other scientific research avenues. And the reason the date is so important is because if we do actually have time, we may have technology advanced enough to combat this problem. If we try and solve it now, whose to say that we couldn't solve it for half the cost in 10 years. A big reason I believe the date is so important is because it allows all of us (Not the idiots) to unify together and solve this problem. It's impossible for us to solve it if we are all on different pages. I also hate that we seem to rely on politicians to do something and we seem to think that they are going to act in the public's best interest. Ultimately, the community will have to solve this issue, not government. Once a solution or multiple solutions are agreed upon, we can take that to government and get the required funding.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "wtf", "channel": "UCx9-LsICG1obhkvljf4wROQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQb8Hh684aESUQkPH8ni21Pqyt2EmPvIP5ygw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But i make my point to say that isnt good reasoning to do nothing and continue things as usual because you dont know for a 100 percent FACT that a projection of an event that hasnt happened yet is false as you say till we go however many years to the day things are projected to happen and yes it might not be 100 percent but anything over 50 percent accuracy is fucked and vonsidering how i know these things are conducted i trust above 50 percent is possible and probable... til the event happens you wont know whether the projections arent right or were not close to right so your skepticism is pointless. The closest we will ever be to knowing what MAY happen is through these projections that you dont want to be right because it will alledgedly .... dundundun DESTROY CAPITALISM. Like who gives a fuck i assume no one would let that just happen anyway because its quite evident capitalism is . part of the deeply rooted fabric of US institutions and conservatives wouldnt allow that to easily happen anyway ... amd you act like every liberal person doesnt support capitalism or doesnt see its benefits enough to know the importance of not just destroying the system there are some who think socialism is better but its not a majority thats why a lot of democratic socialist proposals arent complete  reenvisionments of failed socialist systems. The same way we will work to mitigate climate change we can work to maintain our capitalism if thats the issue.\n\nMost these projections come from modeling differential equations where they take different factors to what contributes to global warming as possible to get a clearer and more concise picture of what the rate of change in the climate will be. So you are right considering things naturally change and more factors can come out the blue or some factors conducted can have mitigated impact on the outlook .... its not easy to be 100 percent right about these types of projections because different factors may introduce themselves to change the projections over the years... this is a similar concept to weather mapping or hurricane tracking. There have been many instances where these things arent 100 percent but most times they fit the general cycle because these maps are well conducted and considerate of as many factors as possible for more precision. But what since hurricane maps are not 100 percent correct does that mean you are not going to put up hurricane shutters. If so have fou when the shit hits. And if it doesnt you got lucky.\n\nIts easy to be skeptical and because things arent 100 percent evident you rather neglect it completely. But it shouldnt take for the event to happen for you to be right or wrong for the good old \"i told you so\" syndrome to kick in while we all die of mass extinction lol. I dont get why people do that to begin with but in general i dont see why corporate greed and capitalist incentives get in the way of us putting in an ACTUAL effort to control and maintain the environment for our future as a whole. No matter how bad the affects are or will be why not try. \n\nThats where my problem will always be is people choose to not try because of this irrational fear they will waste time or capitalism will die or whatever the fear is. Let your fears drive you to want to fix the problems instead of hold you in place and dwell on worst case scenario because to me thats all it seems like people with your mindset do. And to be honest in some regard i need to take my own advice because with some things in my life i let fear keep me in place but its for more things that can be super life altering that i have no game plan for to tackle not because im not willing to try things i just dont know what im going to try and im not willing to risk doing stupid shit that will have negative impact.\n\nSo you are right it isnt as straight forward as testing chemicals in a lab because at least in a lab all yout variables are there in front of you while predicting furgre events not everything is in front of you to  know precisesly, but that doesnt mean we dont try, thats the issue ... because trust me no body wants to waste their time conducting even remotely false projections (no body wants to know the possible fate of the world hurdling towards a mass extinction) or go around fear mongering with projections just to do it and to manipulate a mass amount of people with misinformation and propoganda which to me is a conservative tactic that ive witnessed whether it be democrat or republican ... people get told simplified semi truths or outright lies and because it comes from their news source thats all they care to listen to but hey you might see the same thing in the opposite direction and i cant say other wise because thats your perspective. But some people genuinely want whats best for the over all out look of society. Not just gimmicks to how to mainttain things and hold  survival incentives for personal gain which is basically what conservatives do. Their agenda involves exploiting keeping things the same fear monger propogating and repeating. I say conservatives because this happems with both democrats and republicans that have conservative incentives.\n\nSometimes just allowing people who are willing to put the effort in and give a damn is way better than shutting them down and taking their credibility away. Imagine when you were being raised by your parents you felt like what they were saying was stupid and you tried to force them to do nothing because you thought they were stupid and not because they actually were but because they ciuldnt ensure what they were doing would 100 percent be good for you. But in reality the thing they were doing or proposing for you was in your best interest beyond your understanding to accept and with good intentions to your overall outlook. But because you dont want to believe what they are saying is even remotely possible due to a self proclaimed lack of evidence that what was being said definitely ensured a better future, because of your complex you miss out on something you could have benefitted from and maintained a healthy relationship with your parents. Instead you have opted toxicity and complacency. Thats how I see it.\n\nOne thing to know in the absence of knowledge/information that opens a gateway of possibility ... endless possibility. Logic backs what im saying. So for example if someone says they dont have evidence but the sun might explode on this day just due to self conducted projection... lack of evidence doesnt just imply the sun will never explode and that thats the only possible outcome.\n\n Its equally possible that the sun can explode or it wont explode or some other outcome ... thats the logical way to look at it and at that point when you weigh the possibilities you can say which is more probable due to subjective belief and or factors that may logically shift probability one way but until the event happens you dont know only one to be true as people like to make things seem. \n\nBut people live in delusion and think they are fortune tellers i swear. And this is not a party specific notion i notice this in a vast majority of people and its dumb.\n\nIf the main question of why not even try  gets answered ill have more to consider but until then i hold my case", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Matthew Curiel", "channel": "UC9NWCaVeFqzM2tLd3sZjHxg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSYwIOH-APKe6rsSEqc9HR2RrQ74QnUAjEHOaf_-A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nobody proposes doing nothing. Sometimes people who lean left claim that the absence of government intervention = nothing, but that's not true. Without government intervention, people's choices will still change over time. For example, as people get richer, they tend to have less children, so as the world gets richer that's what's predicted to happen. Also, as people get richer they can afford to care more about the environment. But my main point here is that we shouldn't confuse the absence of government intervention as current trends extending into the future.  \n\n2. I don't know what you mean by \"things are projected to happen.\" It really matters what you mean because if we don't know what we're referring to, we can't have a coherent conversation around solutions. And I think that's part of what makes a lot of people roll their eyes. It's not just that we don't know what the accuracy of these estimates is, but we don't even know what the potential event is. I understand that your position is \"even if there's a 50% chance of there being a catastrophic event, we should prepare for it\" and I agree. However, it depends on how catastrophic the event is and what it's going to be. One annoying thing that climate change activists often do (and I'm not accusing you of this) is they say \"we need to do something\" but they seldom make any specific recommendations for specific problems we're going to face, which makes it hard for everyone else to take them seriously.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "BillyBumpyBear", "channel": "UCFagpo1-eq8F9sr6fe6qdcA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/rAL5u4STP5y0njkIAyD8eaU0OHwvKerBlGZOfnrP4VLtXkhtQ7gu6h8Jykl_SE5aTnjtfmg9rg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Modelling has been pretty spot on and actual temp falls in the middle of model runs and way way more accurate than denier altscientists. \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPSIvu0gQ90\n\n\nSo after decades of denying warming and \"accidentally\" putting -ves in their code to \"find\" cooling at least now they admit they were wrong. BUT some even still deny warming so 2 points, 2 lies.\n\n\nThen he asks a \"serious\" question, so \"serious\" he never looks for answers.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNgqv4yVyDw\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17aE91SBMoY&t=38s\n\n\nBut he says it's simple case of packing your bags and moving... and ignores the costs.And of flood mitigation because the $trillions in real estate will not just be abandoned. Perhaps Aquaman can by those houses.\n\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180703190745.htm\n\n\nLoses to GDP have also been estimated at $30 trillion+.\n\n\nAnd the stats don't back up FF employees feelings about the stats. And no \"intensity\" does not mean \"building more stuff\" it means intensity.\n\n\nhttps://www.climatesignals.org/climate-signals/extreme-heat-and-heat-waves\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/weather/ng-interactive/2018/sep/11/atlantic-hurricanes-are-storms-getting-worse\n\n\nThen he again feels addressing AGW means cutting back the economy when the opposite is the case ie doing nothing will decrease GDP.\n\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/19/climate-change-could-cost-us-up-percent-its-gdp-by-study-finds/\n\n\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/climate/map.php\n\n\nAs for Lomborg's error ridden BS piece, he also forgets to include the costs of causing AGW. The costs of intervening we already pay. We currently pay the FF industry $5.3 trillion a year in taxpayer funded billionaire welfare \"subsidies\" to cause AGW. The cost of addressing AGW according to Bloomberg would require a $12.1 trillion INVESTMENT not handouts, over 25 years. Or 10% of the FF subsidies. The current price of intervention we pay.\n\n\nPoor countries have far less emissions per person thus much less scope to cut emissions and are also the most effected by AGW. Also are reducing emissions as only 2 countries didn't sign up to Paris, one at war the other the US. So the Us pulled out of a meaningless agreement which deniers demand the US pull out of!!! LOL. \n\n\nSo how is paying less for cheaper cleaner RE, no more wars for oil, cleaner air and water, creating jobs and lower taxes \"killing capitalism\"?

There has been no observable proof of a transitional form nor has any proof been found in the fossil record outside of mere speculation. And when species are found which exhibit aberrations, these species never reproduce and in most cases are infertile.

(I'll provide short proofs, if you want the overwhelming evidences, I recommend you read On the Origin of Species)\n\n1. We can actually observe evolution happening in the lab and in nature. Biogeography is another form of evidence. There's also molecular evidence of common descent; you can compare the genes or proteins of different species and see how they are related, which ones were inherited from common ancestors. An example of that is that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, while other apes have 24, and our 2nd chromosome is actually the result of fusion of two chromosomes which exist separately in other apes.\nConsider the three following angles to evolution by natural selection (I'm assuming your question is about that, rather than the broader \"evolution\" as change in Nature, which is the question we seek to explain):\n2. At its core, Darwinian evolution, the natural selection, is a mechanism. It posits that under certain basic selection conditions and traits that are heritable via a gene (practically the DNA in biology, though can be defined more broadly). The first doubt is if the natural selection, wherein the gene is randomly changed not changed in any specific direction, actually can generate the phenomena we observe, disregarding exactly how the gene is manifested. In other words, a question if an algorithm/mechanism actually can produce the outcome we know. This mechanism can be studied quite nicely with computer simulations. This obviously simplifies the matter greatly, and allows scientist to study the mechanism in itself. Especially with respect to complex phenomena, like cooperation between non-kin individuals, has been quite fruitfully studied with simulation. In fact, some of the residual debate around the finer details of evolution, are studied with mechanistic simulations. There is a lot of literature on evolved cooperation, see [for example this](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/62686/414441a0.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). In short, you can say that these studies provide evidence that certain observed phenomena are not contradicting the natural selection process but indeed can be an outcome of it. Of course, it does not prove that these natural phenomena must be produced by natural selection, however.\n3. When we observe an animal or plant that seems very fit to an environment, a consequence of the natural selection idea is that we arrived there through gradual change of previous individuals in said environment. Because evolution takes time over multiple generations, we rarely have distinct ancestors and descendants to compare side-by-side (with exceptions, see next point). Therefore, taking current species that are related by common ancestors of different separation in time, and investigating their similarities and differences should provide a somewhat gradual progression if evolution by natural selection is true. The evolution of the eye is one area that has been fought over a lot, where the critique has been that something that complex just cannot have been gradually formed over time. You can [read briefly about that here](https://www.nyas.org/magazines/autumn-2009/how-the-eye-evolved/). Something related in kind is the study of the genetic code of proteins. Through so called multiple sequence alignments it is possible to quantify the relations between proteins. Again a favourite counter-example to evolution are proteins that take part in a type of pairwise interaction, where the argument is that evolution could never produce both necessary changes without an intelligent designer guiding the changes, because natural selection would have to be gradual, one mutation at a time. So one genre of evolutionary studies is to discover generations of related proteins and show how in fact the complex interactions are reducible to individual mutations, see this [key study for one example on mitochondria](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/37/15791.full.pdf), and its [popular scientific summary here](https://www.wired.com/2009/08/reduciblecomplexity/).\n4. The issue with the former point is that it is all based on retrospective data analysis. It is always possible to be very critical of this and argue that other mechanism are just as possible, and that at best one is showing there is consistency in the theory and current observations. The fruit fly has become a favourite tool to overcome this criticism, because the fruit fly has very short life, so in a reasonable amount of time scientists can study how a fruit fly population evolves to some laboratory defined condition. You can read a brief summary of one long study of [fruit flies living in darkness here](https://www.nature.com/news/flies-reared-in-the-dark-for-60-years-give-up-their-genetic-secrets-1.19339). Bacteria is another example where evolution can be studied in real-time. Generally one can then analyze how controlled environmental conditions lead to the proliferation of certain traits, which then can be traced to their genetic and protein antecedents. Of course fruit flies are one very simple species, so one can always be doubtful about how well findings in them translates to more complex animals. However, as noted in [this nice article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/07/fruit-fly-fascination-nobel-prizes-genetics), as many as six Nobel Prizes have been awarded to research on fruit fly.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "BitchChill", "channel": "UCV3Wr3kvfn0VESks9XM5BNQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/nnZ2YSPy7UZGvxJaNwUokEE3yK0vE0yb7RH6Zy0PI2rqc3gEBz7DWOCSlxLsDzzH-MmbH-84Zg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Creationism is not a part of it (unless you mean the broader definition of it which you clearly don't). The creation stories existed before the genre of history as a recording of scientific fact alone came into being. The creation stories are not about what scientifically happened but what principles we are to believe about human kind, e.g. all for creation comes from God, all creation is good, humans are made in the image and likeness of God etc. Was there a literal garden? Could be, but probably not. Not really important because it's not a focus for the author. All of this is contradictory to the more narrow definition of Creationism that you are referring to that approaches the stories literally. The term, Creationism, didn't even come into being until the 18th century.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jay Suero", "channel": "UCmBB0WsR2p6pKvyyZUbSYkw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSK2IdthpPuXHZ1ZKbf9cTNWIRoTjuIpm3w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
