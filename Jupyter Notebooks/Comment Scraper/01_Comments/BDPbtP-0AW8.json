But if we are experiencing a loss of biodiversity globally. Just say 10%. If you take it just when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago or so we've been told if we look at the scenario it only happens once every million years that's 65 times this has happened at losing 10% at 10% how many times would it take to completely devoid the planet of species.

What you misunderstand about that  statement is that the amount of CO2 added to the atmosphere has gradually increased over the last 200 years and as that CO2 increased so too has their ability to retain heat.  And CO2 is known to stay in the atmosphere for at least 100 years vs CH4 which degrades in about 10 years.  And much of CH4 also degrades into CO2. .\n\nOf course some of is processed by plants but the vast percentage remains in the atmosphere.  \n\nA great deal of CO2 is also absorbed by the oceans and plants, but can only which can only hold so much CO2 as a free molecule.  Most is transformed into carbonic acid which has lowered the ph in the oceans.  This has increased the stress to much of the sea which is too extensive to address here.  \n\nYou also make tangential statements like the point that Antarctica was at one time completely ice free.  My first response is So What?? That was tens of millions of years ago.  Humans probably couldn't even survive for very long in such an environment.   \n\nThis is clearly a issue that we will never agree on.

Want to know what's going to affect us poor humans worse than the warmup?  It'll be when the cycle reverses , again, and we start cooling. And keep cooling. Ice will be back. Glaciers will be back. In fact, more ice and glaciers than humans have ever seen. We do ok when it's warm. We can live over large areas, and grow lots of food. But it's a bitch to live on ice so we'll have to retreat to warmer, but smaller, areas. Things do not grow well at all when it's cold. But, that's exactly what's coming. And humans being humans, I'm sure the global warming/climate change gurus will claim success in reversing the warming trend, and continue with the money/power grab they drain from us lesser beings.

They happened. They don't contain human mistakes. They are real. And they're not disputed. We will be warm, with little ice. And we will be cool, and be heavily glaciated.

Too much to go into here, but studies I looked at said volcanoes played a minor role in glacier melting.  Antarctica is a huge continent and studies have pointed out that glaciers are retreating primarily due to the warming waters underneath the glacier shelves especially in West Antarctica.  As those shelves break off the glaciers behind them accelerate to the ocean. \n\nThwaites Glacier is one of five glaciers in west Antarctica that is most concerning because of the acceletated flow that has displayed in recent years.", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "Michael Deierhoi", "channel": "UCpe092K_LBT_8HYDK6zQx-g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRsW_44ufCFRFGoyXmSfzuKBPOfCan2e1GlaA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

A glacial lake formed at the end of the last ice age when it was much colder and it burst and flooded the north west of what is now the USA, this happened without humans putting out extra greenhouse gases and without an alleged warming climate meaning these events can and do happen when it's cold. The idea that humans can influence the climate is absurd, the climate has always changed and presumably always will. Life on earth is no possible without CO2, it is essential, however if it goes below 180 ppm then life will end on earth, that means if CO2 is halved then we will be on the threshold of extinction, plants love CO2 and thrive on higher levels, people had better wake up to the deception before it's too late.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Klaus Neumann", "channel": "UCigNQRWKcskUlOimtLmfm6g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRcoCbU-LlPvUH71kdBhGGg8jXj0KXve8bJQHlb=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
