{"cid": "Ugwp0DgzRt4W7USsA1d4AaABAg", "text": "Brilliant explanation by Dr. Tyson. Loved Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey and Possible Worlds and a great continuation of what Sagan started in the 1980’s. \n\nOne way I like to think of climate change is a roller coaster analogy. Typically throughout the year the seasons change. The hottest time of the year is summer and the coldest time of the year is winter. (Obviously) So let’s say we smooth out the daily temperature swings. So it’s a month to month or season to season variation. Let’s say the roller coaster is going up and down by 5 feet. You can see the tracks behind you which represents the temperatures recoded but you can’t see what’s ahead. Roller Coaster may go up 5 feet (represents the heat in summer) and go down 5 feet (represents the cold of winter) however the roller coaster increased by 2 inches after every cycle (one year) but that rate increases by double every 5 years (so 4in to 8in to 16in etc) this represents the increase speed of climate feedbacks. You don’t really notice a change because your going up and down 5 feet through the seasons yet it’s increasing by inches. But over time you look back and start to notice your slightly higher up. You notice you can see more things in the distance. \n\nIt’s like that with climate change. Yes you get seasons, sometime seasons are colder than normal sometimes warmer than normal. Even with a steadily increasing average, day to day weather and season changes make hard to know an increase in climate temperatures. The coldest time of year in many locations is as much as 40°F colder than the hottest time of year and even bigger if you say have a hot summer. And your only warming up at a rate of 0.5°F per decade. BUT the rate of warming increases and you start notice the climate is warmer and the effects of a warmer climate: more extreme precipitation (dry or wet), hotter longer summers, warmer shorter winters, less frequent but more intense snow storms. less frequent but more intense hurricanes, melting ice craps, higher sea levels, etc. \n\nBy the end of the century I suspect most locations will still get cold winter and hot in summer but both seasons will be much warmer.", "time": "1 week ago", "author": "Sir.

A good example is the PETM 55 million years ago, global temperatures were over 10°C hotter than today and earth was completely ice free. CO2 levels were also double what they are now. \n\nWe are currently in an ice age that began 2 million years ago. Specifically in a warm interglacial period. We are in a interglacial period as Milankchiv Cycles that operate on time scales of tends of thousands of years and positioned in a way to let more solar activity hit earth. Plus co2 levels are higher keeping earth warm. But Milankchiv cycle have been changing and earth has been cooling the past 6,000 years and we should renter a glacial cycle in 20,000 years.

Show the climate graph for climate time-scales and it looks just as chaotic and jumpy as the short term weather graph. Climate is indeed more predictable than weather - if you predict climate for weather time periods. Yes, the climate tomorrow or next week will be the same as today. But that's as trivial as it is useless. We dont ask what's the climate next week, we ask what's the climate in 30 years or more. \n\nSo your dog-on-leash-on-the-beach parabel shows nothing relevant. \n\nAs for predictability of climate versus weather, you failed to mention two very important factors for climate change: ocean oscillations and ecosphere feedbacks. Maybe youre right and climate is indeed easier to predict (for climate time-scales) as weather (on weather time-scales) but the proof has yet to be done. Id say it isnt because - as you explained - climate is weather averaged over space and time. Averaging chaotic and unpredictable weather data doesnt make it better predictable.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Skandalos", "channel": "UC6R31Oz9XgbDnGlBHg8OidQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSmXvohRjt25owKcxL-rVf9H8OCtZrEn9DvHL9E=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UghFHgvTctTbHHgCoAEC", "text": "Traducción al español; \n\n\"De acuerdo, si los científicos somos tan buenos haciendo predicciones del clima a largo plazo, ¿cómo podemos ser tan malos prediciendo el tiempo? Además, este año, tenemos un invierno más frío en mi pueblo. Como los científicos lo saben, podríamos estar yendo hacia un enfriamiento global. Aquí está diferencia entre el clima y el tiempo. El tiempo es lo que la atmósfera hace en el corto plazo, hora a hora, día a día. El tiempo es caótico, lo que significa que incluso una alteración microscópica puede provocar cambios a gran escala. Eso es por lo que esas predicciones del tiempo a diez días no valen para nada. Una mariposa agita sus alas en Bali y seis semanas después el tiempo arruina tu boda en Maine. \n\nEl clima es la media del tiempo a largo plazo después de muchos años. Está moldeado por fuerzas globales que alteran el equilibrio de energía en la atmósfera. Tales como cambios en el sol, o movimientos del eje terrestre, la cantidad de luz que la Tierra refleja hacia el espacio o la concentración de gases de efecto invernadero en el aire. Un cambio en cualquiera de ellas afecta al clima de una manera que es probablemente predecible. Mi amigo serpenteando representa las fluctuaciones más cortas, eso es el tiempo. Es casi imposible dónde predecir cuál será el olor que le interese a continuación, pero no es difícil saber en qué rango se moverá este serpenteo, porque lo estoy sujetando con una correa. No podemos observar el clima directamente, siempre lo vemos como el tiempo, el tiempo medio durante el curso de los años reconstruye un patrón. Yo represento esa tendencia a largo plazo, que es el clima. Pon tu ojo en el hombre, no en el perro. \n\nEl tiempo es difícil de predecir, como mi amigo aquí, pero el clima es previsible. El clima ha cambiado muchas veces en la larga historia de la Tierra pero siempre respondía a alguna fuerza global. La mayor fuerza que dirige el cambio climático ahora mismo es el incremento del CO2 procedente de la quema de combustibles fósiles, que está atrapando más calor del sol. Toda esa energía adicional tiene que ir a alguna parte. Parte calienta la Tierra y la mayoría termina en los mares.

Various reasons, of course -- but the most common is SLOPPY METHODOLOGY.  You know, the exact same kind of thing that that petition was concerned with.\n\n...Also problematic:  an over-reliance on \"peer review\" instead of actual experimental reproduction of results, which is, rather than \"consensus\", the true GOLD standard of all REAL science.\n\n\"Give me your data and instructions on how you produced your results, so I can try and get similar results myself\"\n\nTHAT is science. And if you're half the expert you claim, you'd know this.\n\nBut what of AGW? No, that's not how \"Climate Scientists\" work, not at all. They refuse to release data and methodology. They will only \"give\" their results to others with like mind, who, gosh, find the same results!!! Whodathunkit? I asked a thousand Democrats if Obama was doing a great job!! And what do you know, 990 of them thought so!! Clearly, IT MUST BE TRUE!!\n\nThe major climate \"think tanks\" have even gone so far as to destroy raw data to prevent anyone from working up their own variations, to see if it fits -- PREDICTS -- things better. Whole terabytes of raw historical numbers have just *conveniently* \"disappeared and become unavailable. But hey, we've got these MASSAGED numbers we used that you can use, too!!\n\nWhat is \"consensus\" worth? Jack and his smelly companion, that's what.\n\nIn 1885, EVERY knowledgeable scientist of EVERY stripe knew exactly how light propagated about the universe. Then TWO GUYS, Michaelson and Morely, did an experiment. As knowledge of those results became widespread, as others replicated their simple experiment (even you could conduct this experiment, probably in your garage), by 1890, EVERYONE knew that they had no freaking CLUE how light propagated. \n\nIn 1912, a well-known meteorologist and polar researcher -- note, he was not a geologist -- advanced the notion that continents MOVED. The \"consensus\" was SURE he was crazy to believe it. And yet.... forty years passed, and something very strange happened -- evidence began to roll in to support that notion. And now it is accepted that, in fact, continents move. One guy, vs. a consensus. Who was right? \n\nAnd those two examples are hardly the only ones -- there is an array of ideas which struggled to find acceptance in the face of \"consensus\". And anyone who claims -- or attempts to claim -- that the consensus MUST be right, BECAUSE it is the consensus, is NOT a scientist, no matter what they earn their salary doing.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Yvigny Goncharov", "channel": "UCppPXB3xANMoiWnOXegvB4Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR1nNBCYbCQtiAjH3JkIOzStyP-UVG1-XVB1A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Let me explain and I won't use big words so you'll be able to understand.\n\nCO2 is a greenhouse gas, that's a fact. Burning Fossil Fuels (Oil, Coal, Natural Gas, ect) releases the CO2 that's trapped in them, Millions of tons per year in fact; FAAAAAAR more than plants and the ocean can absorb. That CO2 that isn't absorbed, stays in the atmosphere, it doesn't just magically go away. If you don't believe me, look at Venus. Lead is a liquid on that planet. Now over years, more and more CO2 stays in the atmosphere and traps the heat from sunlight, that too is a fact. I hope you're still with me, because this is where things get bad. When the atmosphere gets warmer, that causes the oceans to get warmer and polar ice caps to melt, also a fact, it's happening. Fresh water causes salinity in oceans to decrease, that's bad. As salinity decreases, that disrupts ocean currents, very bad. That means that heat and cold are no longer evenly distributed across the planet. The UK which receives heat from the equator on  the North Atlantic Drift now, all of a sudden, doesn't. That causes temperatures in the UK that were pleasant, to now be well below zero, and since the equator can't distribute it's heat to the north, that causes the equator to go from 80 to 150 degrees. I hope you're still with me, because I'm almost done. Now last time I checked, people can't live in a place that's below zero or in 150. That's climate change and that's happening now.

The concept of \"Ideal temperature\" as you put it would be completely arbitrary in the sense that is measured by us (Hence we can come up with any number and say \"Eureka, this is it!\") To understand the issue we need to shortly see it from a non anthropocentric point of view: What happens is that the planet itself doesn't really care about what temperature there is, the earth in fact will still be happily spinning and evolving long after we have killed ourselves (Either by our wars, climate change or some other natural or non natural factor).\nThe real question today is: \"What is, and how to keep, the ideal BALANCE of climate that will support life as we know it, for the long run\" This is not just about temperature, since that is only one factor on this balance. If we manage to answer this big question, we will not 'save the planet' as many people like to state, we will simply save ourselves as humans because this balance will allow us to keep living on earth.\nWe do not know exactly what this answer is yet, and believe me there's a lot of work running at this very moment trying to catch that perfect balance.

That's nearly two standard deviations below the average. Do you know anything about statistics? That's a lot. You do know what happened the last time deniers crowed about two years of 'recovery' in the ice cap size? The following year it fell to the record lowest extent ever since it started to be measured. As I said about rising temperatures (and it also applies to rising heat stored in the oceans and the rising sea levels), it's never a smooth line. But here's a tip, go to the scientists for science. Don't swallow the slurry that a right-wing British rag – with a long track record of lying (and support for Adolf Hitler, incidentally) – pours down your throat. Here's a good site – nsidc [dot]org/arcticseaicenews/charctic-interactive-sea-ice-graph/ You'll see the far more relevant fact that when satellite records began in 1979, on this day in that year the Arctic ice cap was 1.763 million sq kilometres bigger than it is now. Do also read that whole article which gets a lot less gung-ho when they start quoting the scientists – \"‘I’m uncomfortable with the idea of people saying the ice has bounced back.\" Dr Ed Hawkins, Reading University. Finally, you do know what a prediction is? That's when people say something like, \"the Arctic will be ice-free in 2014\". Al Gore said it \"could\" be. That's not really a prediction.

{"cid": "Ughmv-lhQz5xsHgCoAEC", "text": "Please take a look at all information available and judge the situation with out bias. Common facts i've found. The sun is changing. In turn this creates climate extremes. This isn't new it's recorded in the past. The record of recorded sunspots correlates more definitively with the temperature change then co2. Mostly due to the lack of energy released by them. This isn't settled science but i don't believe the anthropogenic effects on the atmosphere are either. We should reduce emissions and pollution regardless but more importantly not take information for face value and dig in every direction. The best conclusion i have come to seems that we're on a cooling trend headed toward a cycle in the sun called a grand solar minimum. A period of decrease in solar activity which then in turn shifts the climate into an ice age. This is why unfortunately they had to go from climate warming to climate change. It didn't fit because the ipcc's  models did not include enough variables. When it was founded the sun was excluded for cause because they were only focusing on anthropogenic climate causes.

The reasons lie in the much larger amount of land in the northern hemisphere and the fact that the ocean’s thermal inertia and ability to mix delay any temperature signal from the ongoing absorption of heat. The local geography also plays a dominating role. The circumpolar current acts as a buffer preventing warm water from the tropics from transporting heat to the South Pole, a buffer that does not exist in the north.\" \n\n\"Does it “balance out” in the end? Not really. Sea ice in the Arctic is reaching dramatic record lows. There are other components of the cryosphere that we can look at as well, permafrost, the Greenland ice sheet, global glacier mass, and these all carry the Global Warming signal.\"\n\n\"One must look at the balance of evidence, not just those bits one likes.

{"cid": "UggJRS9K7q9j0XgCoAEC", "text": "The first five months of 2014 have been the coldest since the National Weather Service began keeping records in 1888. If “climate change” alarmists got out more, they might have noticed.\nBetween 1979 — when weather satellites started measuring temperatures in the lower troposphere — and 1997, they rose about 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.98 degrees Fahrenheit).\nTemperatures stopped rising then, have fallen since 2012. The “pause” in warming (212 months) is now longer than the warming trend was (211 months).\nThe earth has warmed about 16 degrees F since the last ice age. The net increase since 1979 — 0.19 degrees C (0.34 F) — is well within the range of natural fluctuation.\nSo why, as President Barack Obama says so often, do 97 percent of scientists agree climate change is “real, man-made, and dangerous?”\nThey don’t. This bogus stat is derived from two questions University of Illinois researchers asked in a survey of earth scientists in 2008:\n1. “When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?”\n2. “Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”\nThe researchers culled from 3,146 responses those of 79 climate scientists who’d been published in peer reviewed journals. Seventy-six answered “risen” to the first question; 75 “yes” to the second.\nTemperatures have risen since the Little Ice Age ended around 1870, skeptics agree. Most think the activities of humans have some effect on them.\nThe key question is whether that effect is big enough to do harm, but that’s not what the scientists were asked.\nJohn Cook, climate communication fellow (a publicist, not a climate scientist) at the University of Queensland in Australia and eight colleagues examined abstracts of 11,944 articles on climate published between 1991 and 2011.\n“Among abstracts expressing a position . . . 97.1 percent endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming,” they concluded in a paper last May.\nWhich is as meaningless as the “consensus” in the two-question survey, for the same reason.\nSkeptics agree humans cause some warming. Mr. Cook et. al. included papers by prominent skeptics Willie Soon, Craig Idso, Nocola Scafetta, Nir Shaviv, Nils-Axel Morner and Alan Carlin in their 97.1 percent “consensus.”\nOnly 41 papers (0.3 percent) explicitly state support for Mr. Cook’s assertion that humans have caused most of the warming since 1950, former Delaware state climatologist David Legates and three colleagues found in a peer reviewed study last September.\n“It is astonishing that any journal could have published a paper claiming a 9 percent climate consensus when on the authors’ own analysis the true consensus was well below 1 percent,” Mr. Legates said.\nCarbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 285 parts per million 250 years ago to about 380 ppm today. CO2 is a “greenhouse” gas -- it holds heat in the atmosphere -- so if humans are generating more, it should have a warming effect.\nBut probably not much of one. Greenhouse gases comprise less than 1 percent of the earth’s atmosphere; carbon dioxide is less than 4 percent of greenhouse gases; 96 percent of CO2 in the atmosphere was put there by Mother Nature.\nCompared to variations in solar radiation and other natural forces, the effect of greenhouse gases on climate is trivial.\n“There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate,” says a petition signed by more than 31,000 American scientists in climate-related disciplines.\nThat’s rather more than 79 or 41. There is no scientific consensus on human-caused global warming, and there shouldn’t be.\n“If it’s science, it isn’t consensus,” said Mr. Soon, a solar expert at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “If it’s consensus, it isn’t science.”\nScientists search for truth by observation and experimentation, not by taking polls. Consensus is a political concept.\nThe skeptics are true to the scientific method. The abusers of science are those who politicize it.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "aserabus", "channel": "UCtUn7V-J-7Ih6nD53Q3y5hQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRuNZudT_XeYNdF2V1jkbpXMUtJf4dZGtpW-QQ2=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

He also was not shoving his religious beliefs down your throat just because he simply posted a comment, which is what the rest of people casually do on Youtube, and a lot of the times their comments have nothing to do with the video either. He didn't say \"Hey,  Vierotchka there is a God! Go to church and learn about him\". Nor did he hold a gun to your head and make you read the comment and direct his comment at you. So the question is why did you just HAVE to respond to his comment. Because you're angry. Not with Earl Green for doing what everyone else does but you're angry with God so get over it for bad things happening. There was no reason for you to respond to Earl Green so rudely just because he is intelligent and has chosen to believe and he cares about people and was hoping that his comment would turn people to God so their soul would be saved.

In addition, with the added warmth currently being proposed on the atmosphere, there should be more extreme weather but that is not occurring. Meteorological history proves that events which we have witnessed this decade have indeed happened decades and even centuries ago. Water vapor is the domineering greenhouse gas, as it encompasses most of the atmospheric composition and has a higher heat capacity than carbon dioxide. So, as of now, we have yet to observe drastic increases in MSL heights and have yet to observe continuous catastrophic meteorological events. So even if the Earth is warming slightly, the effects are not observable. Also, the USA has a significantly higher amount of automated surface observing stations (ASOS) than any other country in the world, so we get a greater density of data than any other place.

So saying the burning of fossil fuels is the most significant reason for climate change seems a little far fetched.\nCuriously the same folks trying convince us that all this man made CO causing the \"greenhouse\" effect can be balanced by adjusting our exhaust emissions from machinery into nothing more than water vapor.

However I want to know what do you do for a living. That might be the difference in our focus.\n\nAs an engineer and a laboratory scientist, It is clear to me, the last 2 documents present a plan to reduce the human impact on the environment. The plan focus on management of resources, handling contamination and reducing population. Neither document makes affirmations about poisoning people or exterminating large amounts of them. Neither is there a free card to polute as much as any country wants. What it says is that the amount of pollution and greenhouse gases (unavoidable right now) permited to developed countries has a limit. This limit is permited because other countries dont pollute as much and is a grace amount for them to start making changes to achieve a total reduction of 80% in emitions for 2050.\n \nAbout reducing population: It's only logical that with less people in the world there will be less environmental impact. Then it is needed a policy to reduce the amount of people in the world. The fastest growth of population happens in the poorest section.\nLet me remind you that the people who run the world (unfortunately) is the mere 1%. The rest of us are in the 99%, that's the part that need to be slowly reduce through the next 3 decades. The means to do that need off course be humanitarian and respectful.\nNo matter how much we try it, they can't be touched unless you become one of them.\n\nAs Holdren does, I also believe we need to force people to be birth responsible, no other species in the planet has more children than the ones than can be fed, except , the viruses.\nI understand if you feel insulted , but this is not a plot, it is widely open, there's not rich people trying to kill poor ones. There's simply poor people growing in alarming numbers. The rich ones can only sit there and wait for us to suffocate each other over the water, the food and the air, They can pay for it the 1% has 90% of the money and resources.

Not the kind for global warming though, but more like Thermodinamics and materials science. I mention this because I want you to understand that reading ot writing about science, and actually understanding it are 2 different things. \n\nWhat you present as flaws in the tests (like the Antartic ice for the Carbon measures) are really opinions, because it is a fact that those tests work. And the anomalies you mention don't affect the result not by even 1%. A fact is no subjest to debate or opinion. You can't deny gravity.\n\nJust to be clear we (The Scientific Community) are not saying in the past there hasn't been any global warming and subsequent cooling, because there has been, We are alarmed because the rate at with the temperature is rising is being accelerated by human actions over the natural limit.\n\nWith all the respect let me tell you, as an Engineer and an artist (I also write comics about science fiction) I understand your drive to go against the system, but you are just doing it for the sake of being against something. Science fiction and Science ARE NOT, I'll repeat ARE NOT parts of the same coin. The fact that Pickard used tablets 20 years ago or that Jules Verne wrote about sending a man to the moon only proves the inspirational nature of art.\n\nTo be an artist it is enough with being talented and there's not really a need to study and learn about technical and theoretical stuff. Some of the best writers have made huge science mistakes and they've never been accountable for it. To be a scientific you need to understand physics, chemistry, mathematics, materials, medicine and others. And people lifes and technology advancements depend on your calculations and decisions, we are always accountable for that.\n\nSo don't mix oranges with apples. artists are as needed as Scientists but not in the same coin, more like in a nthaedron with our faces being the ones fartest from each other. \n ", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Nando Restrepo", "channel": "UCdWAqhp0iNZ3EXHJM2LZXoQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTkkpWEGGDMPswEF_3hGp0QCj-I0xNVrSOxL4hqfRM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you need proof just look at your phone, at your medicines, at the electricity in your home. Nature has multiple branches, so there's the need for different type of scientists to study all of it (astrophysics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, geology, etc).\n2- But all the different scientists share a foundation in knowledge of physics, chemistry, Biology, to name a few. And more importantly all of them use the same method, the Scientific Method. This method is flawless, because the method itself asks you to keep trying to debunk what's already accepted if new evidence appears. If the mayority of scientists of a certain branch have tried this method and adquired the same results in light of different experiments and conditions, who are we to call them liars? Unless you are a speciallist on Weather you'll be relying on other people who are. And 97% of those people concluded that the earth is getting warmer because of us.\n\n3- As you pointed,Mr Tyson doesn't proves anything on his show, to prove something you must run tests and trials in a laboratory or in the site where the phenomenom takes place. 97% of the weather scientists around the globe already did this and found the same results which give 97% of the sureness they are right. Because the rest of the scientific community shares the basic knowledge, but is already working on something else, we cannot run the same tests, but we can review and evaluate the material presented. That's how you get a second layer of confidence on the matter. \n\n4- We, the scientists never give a truth for granted, everything is subject to test and trial. That's why science teachers take you to laboratories to duplicate the experiments instead of making you read about them, to make you see with your eyes if possible.\nThis show aims to encourage the new generations to do science. To interest them in its study, to be knowledgeable, to design experiments and find evidence to support or refute what we know.\n\nThat's why my friend your position is not only a product of paranoia and a cry to find exciting ideas to write and read, it is insulting to the people who made possible that you could be reading this. This document which I wrote miles away from you, that you can read seconds after I finish it with a wireless connection inside an apartment with lights at night inside a building of 20 stories high, after not dying from the common flu and being totally calm when seeing a comet knowing that it is not a premonition that God is going to punish us.\n\nYou are welcome, from the Scientists before me who made all this possible and let us walk on their shoulders and their vision.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Nando Restrepo", "channel": "UCdWAqhp0iNZ3EXHJM2LZXoQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTkkpWEGGDMPswEF_3hGp0QCj-I0xNVrSOxL4hqfRM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

While they do employ credible scientists, they tend to skew opinion toward climate change denial, or atleast ambiguity to support their sponsors.\n\nRegardless of the opinions, we know the data points toward climate change. As you know, there are already many economic reasons to reduce our fossil fuel consumption and strive for energy efficiency and renewable energy production. The damage that climate change causes to us is just another reason that we should take this more seriously and act quickly.\n\nThe energy industry's opposition is based on the relatively low profit margins associated with renewable energy because they have higher start up costs relative to fossil fuels which as cheap to start. It's a short-sighted view. As solar and wind becomes cheaper, the economics will change, and they will begin to support renewable energy and accept climate change because it makes more economic sense. \n\nThis was the case with the dangers of leaded gasoline a few decades back which severely fucked many people. \n\nWhat is needed now is just more public support for renewable energy and efficiency to bring down the costs.

To everyone else: I am just stating that the earth goes through periods of warming and cooling all the time. Little ice ages happen approx every 150years, which means one should appear within the next 15-20years, so you could argue that the earth is warming (due to human emmissions), but there are MORE factors that account for warming/cooling (be it geomagnetic field, vegetation etc). The earth is complicated and you can't just say that human carbon emissions are the only factor. It's a TINY factor in a BIG equation. I would recommend reading up on Randall Carlson. We don't know what causes the warming, we need to research this more and in the mean time, let's focus on reducing pollution related health issues and not \"saving our planet\", because no matter what, the climate will change.

On the other hand, sea level rise from AGW will exacerbate the effect: a sea level rise of less than half a meter will allow such a tsunami to travel kilometers more inland, and thus cause thousands more deaths.\nRenewable energy is not being developed or deployed at a significant rate by just the market alone; the increase in the past couple decades is largely due to the incentives and laws developed by governments. And largely in response to the advice from scientists.\nA \"geological blink of the eye\" is irrelevant here, as we are talking about humans and society.

This is the question the 'climate change' guys don't like to escalate.\" => Actually they do. We know how much carbon dioxide we are putting into the air. In fact scientist do a great deal in estimating green house gases from natural sources too. Next time a volcano erupts, read the estimates of scale of it. We also know that we are currently the largest producers of carbon dioxide, consider the fact that we populate the entire world, we are most definitely affecting the climate. Don't believe me? Read BBC on \"Weekends are wetter\". A cliff note is that our weekly schedule actually affects the probability of rain.\n\nTo answer another question:\nWell, whilst there are benefits in the climate getting warmer (i.e the nordic sea route opening, shortening time and cost of transporting goods), generally we should worry about climate changes and rising sea levels. Remember, we as a race gain dominance when the climate was as it was. Change may not bode well for us, higher on the food chain. To understand this, lets put one example, u may need to read up on. That is the undersea current. It is cause by the difference in temperatures between the water. Should our oceans warm up enough, this temperature difference may not be sufficient to circulate the ocean, causing an increase in build of hydrogen sulphate, poisoning the sea and hence one of our major food source, fish. Even without waiting so long, Fishes as our food source is already compromised by the sudden increase in Jellyfish population which is said to strive due to the increase heat and pollution\n\nFurthermore, while I do not doubt human tenacity to survive adversity, I ask: Do you really want to reach the point of adversity before you change? To have flood defenses, sounds great. But you must understand one thing about flood defenses, it only needs to fail in a single area to cause major catastrophe. Read up on Hurricane Katrina, Levee failure. Ironically, part of the reason why hurricanes causes more damage now is also attributed to the lost of mangrove swamps near the hurricane's path which originally help lower its potency.\n\nIf you are genuinely interested in how it affects us, my advice is to actually read up on the world in a neutral position. Throw that notion of \"is something true\" and read it without bias. Then assess the information and see if you have a conclusion. My understanding did not stem from proving climate deniers wrong but just the general interest in how the world works.
