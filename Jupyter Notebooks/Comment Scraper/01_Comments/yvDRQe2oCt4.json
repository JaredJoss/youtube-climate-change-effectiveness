CO2 is what plants and forests require in order to live and function in keeping the planet's air and temperatures clean and moderate (preventing and moderating climate change). Now think for a moment...why are we attempting to eliminate fossil fuel use?  To lower the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere...hmm...didn't it just say that plants need that CO2 to live and sustain the planet???  So how can lowering the amount of plant food in the atmosphere at the same time as increasing the amount of trees that consume that food actually work ???   It can't work...and it won't work.

All life on this planet is carbon based.  CO2 is the primary source of carbon for life.  CO2 is essential for life.  If CO2 levels fall below 150 ppm (parts per million), plants cannot survive.  If plants cannot survive, animals and humans will struggle to survive.  For most of earth's 4.7 billion year history, CO2 levels have been dramatically higher than today.  Most modern plants evolved during periods when CO2 was 3 to 5 times higher, and consider the current climate to be in a CO2 drought.  Plants have pores they open to absorb CO2, in our low CO2 climate they need to open them often more of to absorb sufficient CO2.  Every time they open, vapor escapes... as a result plants are far more water efficient in higher levels of CO2, and less water efficient in lower CO2.  Plants are more drought resilient in higher levels of CO2.   Corn, wheat, rice and other course grain yields have increased 300% over the last 60 years do to the little bit of extra CO2 in the atmosphere.  India is now a net exporter of wheat, they cannot eat all the wheat the produce.  When you drive in your car you are experiencing significantly higher levels of CO2 than exist in the atmosphere.  Each human emits about 800 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere each year simply by breathing.  We exhale about 100 times the amount of CO2 we absorbed when inhaling.  Mother Nature emits significantly more CO2 than humans do by burning fossil fuels.  The oceans, which cover 70% of the earth continually emit it from vast deposits of naturally dissolved CO2, natural fires, volcanoes and decaying plant life continually emit it... and of course breathing animals including humans emit it.  Life thrives near the warm equator and struggles near the cold poles.  During the Cambrian period (the Cambrian Explosion) when an explosion of life burst onto the earth 500 million years ago it was significantly warmer and CO2 levels were 5 times what they are today.

It was warmer 1000, 2000 and 7000 years ago than today, while CO2 levels were significantly lower and all during periods well before humans began burning fossil fuels.  From about 12000 years ago to about 7000 years ago the earth warmed dramatically coming out of the most recent glaciation period... sea levels rose about 400 feet over that time.

The first part, the steadily increasing fee charged to fossil fuel producers based on the climate pollution from the products they sell, fixes the failure of the energy market to account for the costs of the pollution from using fossil fuels.  It enables efficient market forces to reduce climate pollution effectively and at the least-cost according to most economists (http://clcouncil.org/economists-statement). \nThe second part is what to do with the money collected.  This policy rebates all the money collected back to all households on an equal basis each month as a dividend. This recoups us all for the damages from the pollution. It also has a very progressive effect: two-thirds of all households break even or receive more in their monthly dividend than they pay in higher prices due to the fee.  Those who come out ahead are those with smaller than average carbon footprints, which includes most low-income households. \nThe benefits can be seen in the four-page summary of a report by REMI, available here: http://citizensclimatelobby.org/remi-report\nThe household impact by various demographics can be seen in this report: http://citizensclimatelobby.org/household-impact-study/", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "John Gage", "channel": "UC0zhp1J9IjEmuc77B4AHYHg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSpe6PGFfT4j9z7lYGA1JXMyPYq4srYip-wms_6xQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We build roads and buildings to live in and make more people that do the same with increasing speed and efficiency.The only way to help is for the human race to end or just hit pause for the next 20 years. \n\nYou say plant trees provided they are native to an area. I get it but here’s something to think about.. When you choose those native trees to plant, did you use “native soil”? And why choose THOSE native trees instead of ALL the others. The process is completely ARTIFICIAL and you are still tinkering with nature. Humans don’t get it. There is no such thing as “wildlife management”. Either it is wildlife is truly Wild and free - not interfered with by humans or people are imposing their will upon them. There is nothing natural about it. It’s all humans playing around with what we think the world should look like. It doesn’t matter if you plant a native plant, a flower from another state, or a vegetable garden - it’s a human form of control defined by humans.\n\nImagine if some superior being lived on earth that was higher up on the food chain than us and felt we should only live in our native range. Everyone outside of Africa would be exterminated or moved back to Africa where humans are from. And then imagine if that being “managed us” to where we could only eat plants and animals from out native range and said it was to preserve us and our species. It’s funny how humans can act elitist imposing their will on what they think should exist in an ecosystem with their imagination of what is “native” while calling for biodiversity (essentially “egg is more than one basket”  to allow families of organisms to continue even when faced with stressors that eliminate part of their species) and yet humans are walking contradictions. Everything we have done to flourish as a species has benefited from our ability to gather resources from all parts of the earth. \n\nThe best thing to do for nature is to get out of it’s way and let it do what it wants to “unmanaged”. Unfortunately, humans are not going to stop making humans. They will not stop big industry. And, they wil not stop trying to MANAGE “nature” by imposing our view of how it should work.

The type of tree, and where you plant them is very important. Planting fast-growing trees like gum trees and pines is not generally a good idea. Firstly trees like gum trees are highly combustible because of the oils they contain. The life cycle of gum forests relies on fire to regenerate itself. So for carbon storage, not a good idea.\n Pine/conifers forests tend to leave the soil deficient. Things that grow fast usually have a shorter life span so this means carbon collected will return sooner. All trees lose leaves but deciduous tree loses theirs in Autumn which is why the CO2 levels increase because the trees/leaves are not absorbing CO2 and the leaves decomposing on the ground return CO2 back to the atmosphere. \n\nGoing half-cocked and planting millions of trees willy nilly without planning you know will come back to bite in the future. Nature has a way of establishing land which is smaller plant establishers first, followed by larger shrub/tree species and then more long term trees. Native plantings are possibly the safest bet, but I like the idea of fruit/nut/ olive orchards that way it is a win-win. \n\nAll living things respire so plants produce CO2 all the time but more at night. Basically, all glucose/staches/fats are carbon compounds so when the animal/plant needs some energy for growth/metabolism it burns the glucose which releases CO2 in the process. \n\nShells/rocks are a better store of carbon but will release CO2 under weathering.\nJust to add for Juke\n\nBecause carbon via CO2  is such a useful builder for life there is a comparative lack of it in the atmosphere true. There is a point however where too much is not as good, so the idea of CO2 as plant food is only partly true as there are many things that plants need to grow successfully.  Optimum levels for most plants seems to be around 800ppmto 1200ppm. Beyond these levels, it can then start effecting uptake of nitrogen which is used in building protein content in crops.\nC4 and Cam plants there are fewer advantages to increased CO2. 90% of plants are C3 plants and get most of the benefits from increased CO2 levels to a point.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ian Wilson", "channel": "UCsyr8XkjlSTpc3VH-7WEjyg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJ8qq0IPfVi5HbY5wjG_z7TTeREVLIR4kG5hSJ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

To have data collection retain its integrity in this instance, variables need to be controlled. When a ground measuring station used to be in a meadow, and now resides in a parking lot then guess what, it will read hire temperatures ... duh.  But this is part of the data collection.  Don’t trust me, go and do the research yourself on data collection for weather.  Most of the data that is accurate is only from the late 70s.  40 yrs of data when looking at 20,000-40,000 yrs between earth heating cooling tells you nothing.  I am fully for reducing our pollution, but from data, it is clear we are not the cause of any perceived global changes.  Remove humans from the equation and weather trends would remain the same.

I am sure if you were to sit in a panel with scientists discussing about climate change, vaccine technology, etc. you would have no clue what they’re talking about. I am a trauma nurse who worked with intubated COVID patients. And to see how many people denied something that I saw right in front of me, makes me know that individuals like you have no clue what you’re talking about. I don’t know if you believe in COVID or even vaccination but I know if you were to receive report with me about a COVID patient you wouldn’t understand what we were talking about if I said the patient is on levo at 4, Vaso at 0.04.

If a place is getting less rainfall more and more of its waters will flow to the oceans and this there will be less fresh water. Planting trees helps preserve watery ecosystems by stopping erosion and encouraging transpiration which will rain back down in that area, keeping the water around in that environment longer, they also shade the ground allowing the soil to retain more water. Use your head here, they’re talking about reforesting where there was already forests before humans destroyed it, if it wasn’t a desert there before with those extra trees there, why would it be any worse replanting them where they already were?
