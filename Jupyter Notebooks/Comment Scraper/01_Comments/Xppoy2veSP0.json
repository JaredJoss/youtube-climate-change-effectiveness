{"cid": "UggRC11dkclBxHgCoAEC", "text": "Absolutely not. Another garbage attempt to create the next big fan theory in ASOIAF by someone whose knowledge is clearly show-specific. The most amusing part of all these great \"theories\" is that they all compare themselves to R+L=J, and then project themselves as the next big one on the horizon.\n\nThe climate on the planet that ASOIAF takes place on is controlled by MAGIC, not the rotation around the primary star vis-a-vis the rotation on its own axis. The Long Night was a 100-year old winter, caused by the invasion of the Others, and it ended with the their defeat.\n\nThe two deities, R'hllor and The Great Other, are constantly in conflict with each other, competing to consume humanity for magical power and dominance over the planet. The planet's seasons reflect the current state of this conflict. Long summers result when R'hllor or those associated with fire in some way, or those who stand opposed to The Great Other, are in dominance over the planet. When The Great Other is dominant, or when R'hllor is significantly weakened, long winters are observed. \n\nASOIAF is not about climate change; it is about how the advent of humans into the planet is slowly destroying the influence of magic. Beginning from the First Men (and then the Andals) destroying weirwoods to curb the influence of the children's magic to the Order of Maesters systematically eliminating magic from the world, humanity's rise has suppressed the power of the primal forces that ruled the planet. The Children of the Forest, the Giants, the Others, the race that built the foundation of the Hightower; all these races and their magic have been negatively impacted by the rise of humanity. The current invasion of the Others is likely something of a final stand.\n\nMAGIC vs MIGHT.

The video is absolutely right in that a huge point of the books and the show is that the people of Westeros are so preoccupied with their petty squabbles that they ignore the existential threat to humanity.  Climate change certainly fits this template but the books don't necessarily single out climate change.\nC. Yes, Preston Jacobs more often than not spews out nonsensical and far-fetched bs, but seeing as he loathes the show and constantly uses the books to undermine D&D's logic I don't see how his knowledge base can be show-specific.\nD. As far as your magic vs. might statement, that seems very reasonable. However, magic clearly does not exist in the real world and, if we're going to look for any meaning or any reality-applicable political/ethical statements, we would at least have to consider the symbolism that this presents.

{"cid": "Ugihc2P1rOsC33gCoAEC", "text": "An unseen issue that seems like a myth and is not taken seriously yet leads to the climax is a common scenario in entertainment stories. Politics just use the already brain washed scenario in it's favor. It is also not completely brain washing but human instinct to disbelieve something that cannot be seen even though evidence presents its self. It's common for the evidence to be rationalized as something else. That is because there are times when something seems to be one thing and turns out to be something completely different. But there are differences between the two scenarios witch need detailed observation to tell the difference. Usually the majority is not capable of the detailed observation and thus majority rules and the situation is brushed away as a less sinister issue. This is also why you have the scenario in entertainment where there is the one smart guy trying to convince the majority about something until it is too late but the smart guy comes up with a plan after realizing the majority wont listen and saves the day. I've literally have seen people have contradictory opinions about two similar situations based off what they had watched on tv before hand on countless occasions(be observational and you see a lot). I used to think my lack of interaction was because I was too busy observing, but in reality it's just really weird to interact with people because you start to see that they do weird and fucked up shit but you must continue to interact like you didn't realize it because the group as a whole wont understand you reactions because they don't see it them selves. Only when your ready to protect your self or something you give a shit about should you bring up and issue, but you won't need extra observational skills for that because people see what pertains to them automatically (for the most part)", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "zekeman76", "channel": "UCvBaC6H2Ntd1aMsfeYyom6Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSqZjkA8_v01TQr-f8eicS-_aSVypcFFOPF4rOaLg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Keep in mind that only a fraction of the greenhouse effect on Earth is attributable to CO2, and CO2 is already absorbing 87% (according to the IPCC) of what it theoretically can.\n\nThe IPCC offers plausibility arguments for how greatly increasing CO2 could drive temperatures ever higher, but these are far from proven, and are not widely accepted by the climate science community.
