{"cid": "Ugz39ArRNdFue2z2kDR4AaABAg", "text": "Want to help save the planet?  Here are 6 things every individual can do to save the Earth:\n1.  Go VEGAN (food, clothes, accessories, toiletries, furniture etc.)\n2.  Consume products LESS and become an INFORMED consumer.  \n   -  Don't buy anything new (except if necessary, like medicine or contact lenses).  You can buy basically everything USED or make it yourself.  \n   -  Do your RESEARCH before buying anything.  Many products are destroying the environment via the extraction of raw materials, the production process, transportation etc.  Also production lines are full of human labor abuses.  Do your RESEARCH if you must buy something.  Remember, your purchase of a product acts to support that company and everything that went into that product.\n   - If you don't know 100% how a product was made at each and every step, then do NOT buy the product.  You could be unknowingly supporting the extinction of orangutans in Indonesia (ex. palm oil) or the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (ex. beef).  No joke.  Stop buying products unless you are 100% informed.  Don't be selfish.  You  don't need most products.  Buy it used at eBay/Craigslist/Goodwill or make it yourself instead of contributing to the destruction of the planet.\n          - Check if the product has any certifications, such as:  RainforestAlliance, FairTrade, RSPO - Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, USDA Organic etc.\n   - Stop buying via Amazon!!!  It has rampant human rights abuses that have been clearly reported on many times, including abuses and neglect during COVID-19.  In addition, despite some of its 'climate pledges', Amazon has a terrible negative impact on the environment.  Think factories, energy-usages, packing for all of those boxes, carbon emissions for the trucks that deliver them etc.  If you buy via Amazon you are supporting human rights abuses and environmental degradation.  Do you really need that product?  Just buy it used or at least directly form the actual company.  Don't be selfish, be responsible.\n3.  Go plastic and packaging free.  Don't buy anything with non-compostable packaging, or that's made of non-environmental material.  If you do, make sure it's recyclable and recycle it properly.\n4.  ADOPT and REDUCE family sizes.  Humans have overpopulated the world and are destroying the environment as a result.  The human population is almost at 8 billion.  We need to intelligently and voluntarily work to get our numbers down to at least half of that.  It is a very personal issue, but please consider adopting children instead of creating new children.  If having biological children, consider smaller family sizes.  \n   - Donate money and/or volunteer at organizations that support women's rights and literacy.  On average, women's illiteracy rates are inverse to the number of children they have.  I.e. the number of children a woman has decreases as she becomes literate and more educated.  Here are some ideas:  Room to Read, World Literacy Foundation, Malala Fund, UNICEF, Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED), Afghan Institute of Learning, Invest in Girls, Educate Girls, AGE Africa, Asante Africa Foundation, She‚Äôs the First, Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE).\n5. VOTE and become politically informed.  Make sure to stay politically informed and pressure your local, state and national representatives to support issues and legislation that save and protect the environment and species.  VOTE during elections.\n6. Use only RENEWABLE energy and use LESS of it.  \n   - Buy carbon offsets from a reliable company for your yearly energy usage.\n   - Stop flying unless absolutely necessary (and buy carbon offsets if you do).  Walk, bike, ride a velomobile, use public transportation instead of gas-powered cars.\n   - See if your energy company has an option for you to buy green energy or support green energy initiatives.\n   - Install your own renewable energy sources, like solar panels.\n   - Be conscious throughout your day and use as little energy as possible.  Ex. instead of turning on the heat, just wear a few more layers and close the windows.\n\nWe can save the planet if everyone just does their part.  Everyone please act!\n\nCheck out this presentation for more information on human impacts on the environment and what you can do to help:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP83Qz6TabM", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "OneWorld22", "channel": "UCfImtdq6CFl50380Elm_JWQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRoKjqlAUENtjQv-dK3Ll8625J9dn8IP1lcekWyjw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I just dont watch the MSM and see the full picture, which is that the world is controlled by a tiny handful of people who want full spectrum dominance over the world. And no, I don't buy into QAnon and their idea that \"Everything is going to plan and we should trust the plan\" as much as there is truth regarding child sex trafficking and pedophilia within the elite and the entertainment industry. I mean, why doesnt the MSM cover it as much as they cover COVID-19? Gee I wonder why. In fact, the MSM was designed to lie to you and its been that way since the CIA admitted the existence of Operation Mockingbird. Let's not forget the MSM controlled by a tiny handful of people with an agenda. The CIA also admitted that the term \"conspiracy theorist\" was coined by them to discredit those who question the JFK assassination narrative.\n\nAs for COVID-19 being a plan, well did you know that before the pandemic started, there was a simulation called Event 201 that simulated a Coronavirus outbreak? Coincidence? I think not considering how it simulating not only the virus, but the effects of the outbreak and the rise of so-called \"misinformation\" and many more. If this was all about trusting science, then why are doctors and scientists who question the MSM narrative are censored and even have their careers put in jeopardy? Are Dr. Judy Mikovits, Dr. Andrew Kaufman, Dr. Dolores Cahill, the Bakersfield doctors, Dr. Scott Jensen, and many more that have or are too scared to speak out don't deserve or aren't qualified enough to talk about COVID-19 even though they went through similar training and have done research in topics related to it? Radical rightist? Give me a break. I believe in the Constitution and clearly the lockdowns and everything the corrupt governments around the world have done are a human rights violation. What about the rise in suicides, depression, and domestic abuse that resulted from the lockdowns? Heck I even heard that cancer patients and other non COVID-19 patients had delayed treatment or are too scared to go to the hospital to get treated. Why is BLM allowed to crowd the streets and riot yet churches or funeral services arent allowed to have full capacity? And how am I supposed to trust the PCR Tests that have a high false positive rate. The inventor of it admitted the tests are not useful for detecting viruses. I heard stories of people waiting in line and then even though they didn't get tested they were told they have COVID-19. Not to mention the death rate for it is very low and how the CDC admitted that most of the deaths classified as a COVID-19 death were of people who have co-morbidities.

The original poster of the primary comment is most likely deriving their hate for being autistic from how they're treated in society, not because of their direct neurological makeup. Any population that is discriminated against will have significantly higher rates of self-doubt, and many turn to hating themselves, assuming that they're the issue.\n\nIt's even incredibly common for those of high intelligence to feel the same way; that their mindset is a curse. But clearly, being highly intelligent is an objective advantage. \n\nSimilarly, those that are of minority sexualities and gender identities feel the same ways. \n\nTherefore, this highlights issues with society itself and its structure, not an issue inherently the result of the person, their general biology, or their neurology.\n\nUnless one can identify issues inherent to being autistic, and those issues significantly outweigh and impact the person compared to environmental factors, such as how one may be treated by others, then it's irrational to assume being autistic as a curse.\n\nAlso, when you take into account that various types of ASD are most likely evolutionary developments and/or a result of natural selection, it wouldn't make sense for it to be a curse objectively.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "Saturn", "channel": "UCbWdorbY36g0bimEqj78sPw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSrRjwh1vvTxqMdh7uDwWUd04GZrKTMfqF6TsMeWg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Sensory difficulties are seen in various other animals, and are likely to be evolutionary advantages in a natural environment.> \n\nSo what are you going to do about it? Here in the U.S., there's at least the option of homeschooling so that kids can be brought up in a more quiet environment and avoid the noises at a regular school. As much as I don't feel comfortable listening to the fire alarm, you can't just take it away in order to create a more comfortable environment for Autistic people. What's the alternative? What about loud noises such as crowd noises, cheering, dog barking, and screaming? That doesn't sound artificial if you ask me and the first sentence sounds confusing.\n\n<Difficulty socialising to a certain extent is inherent, but the anxiety, possible depression, and how people treat you is the result of those treating you that way.>\n\nBasically, you're claiming I'm experiencing interpersonal oppression, which to me, isn't something that's going to help me move forward. So it's not my fault people back in elementary school made a big deal about me saying hello? It's not my fault I run away from certain people when they greeted me? It's not my fault I can't group converse? Cause from my experiences, I don't see how it is not my fault and I shouldn't hold myself accountable. I still feel it's useless always blaming other people for my struggles.\n\n<A daily routine can be bland, and this one can be an inherent issue with being autistic at times. However, the desire for these routines is derived from hunter-gatherer societal environments, and tend to work much better there.>\n\nAnd to me, routines tend to be bland. Especially if you're sitting in desks all day and getting burned out from doing homework and trying to pay attention to dry content. If anything, it makes me comfortable but not happy and can stop me from thinking about things that will impact my life such as my future and becoming more independent. \n\n< Vehicles are also artificial, and humans aren't naturally made to drive them.> \n\nSo how would you change that? Without vehicles, it would be hard to get to places faster without exercising or exploiting animals. I can't live alone in the suburbs, a small town, or in most places without a car. I can't get outside the house unless my parents are available to drive me or I blow cash on a Uber or Lyft. I have been on several public transit systems and I see the limitations of public transport and how driving can be more superior to it. \n\n<You fail to mention any points where being autistic is any significant, inherent disadvantage.

Especially teachers since they're too busy trying to teach a big class of students with different backgrounds and their probably are still paying off their student loans as well hence they don't have the time or motivation to research Autism.

My Asperger's structures my brain in a way where it's hard for me to practice executive functioning skills such as multitasking, which in turn makes it hard for me to drive.

It's about them understanding and utilising basic respect. Again, I can apply the same logic to other minority populations: \r\n\r\nOthers don't have enough time to understand culture common among black people, therefore, it should be up to the black person to normalise themselves and act typically around white people, and is also the fault of the black person for acting differently in the first place.\r\n\r\nOthers don't have enough time to understand homosexuality either, and it's then the fault of that homosexual person for acting and expressing themselves in a stereotypical gay manner, of which then caused them to be rejected. After all, they don't fit in, nor does everyone have time to try and understand them, therefore, the gay person should change, and those other people aren't at fault for discriminating against that individaul.\r\n\r\nOthers don't have enough time to understand the overly-analytical mindset of various highly intelligent people, therefore, it's the fault of that highly intelligent person if they act in a highly intelligent, logical manner, and should then make efforts to change themselves to conform more to societal norms. Because, in the end, we can't just expect other people to change or make efforts to understand differences when they're already preoccupied.\r\n\r\nDo you see how silly that sounds?\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou don't necessarily have to blame anything. Although, driving vehicles is something being autistic causes deficiencies in for some individuals.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, humans aren't made to drive vehicles, therefore, I believe blaming being autistic is illogical, as when autistic neurology evolved, there were absolutely no vehicles to be driven at the time.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nBlaming society doesn't mean that one ignores that they can improve on their weaknesses. Just like everyone, even neurotypicals, we have to improve on our weaknesses because of our neurology. Similarly, neurotypicals also have to improve on some of their weaknesses in life because of their neurology. It goes both ways.\r\n\r\nLike I said; I acknowledge that I have weaknesses, and that I even work to improve them. That doesn't mean I can't acknowledge the objectivity of autism falling under the social model of disability, mostly due to how society is structured for the majority.\r\n\r\nI know society is what primarily restricts me, yet I still work around that.\r\n\r\nI also simply don't see the logic in blaming a type of neurodivergence for issues when that specific type of neurodivergence is what has contributed to many of society's technological developments.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\nUse a search engine to discover the following studies. It should be a simple copy and paste:\r\n\r\n\"Superior fluid intelligence in children with Asperger‚Äôs disorder\" - enhanced fluid intelligence due to ASC.\r\n\r\n\"Europe PMC - Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity\" - enhanced systemizing, attention to detail, and sensory sensitivity due to ASC.\r\n\r\n(unrelated to my previous claims, but good to read nonetheless) \"People with autism possess greater ability to process information, study suggests\" - superior information processing in relation to minor and important details due to ASC.\r\n\r\n\"Brosnan M, Lewton M, Ashwin C.

J Autism Dev Disord. 2016;46(6):2115-2125. doi:10.1007/s10803-016-2742-4\" - evidence of more deliberative decision making, which correlates with logical reasoning ability\r\n\r\n\"ScienceDirect - Long-term memory and levels-of-processing in autism\" - displays superiority in certain areas of long-term memory in autistic individuals, but also deficiencies in other areas\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou know, the typical overly-analytical mindset that causes them to not fit in? Or other mindsets, such as being overly-attentive to bigger and smaller details, of which may also cause them to appear abnormal in social contexts.\r\n\r\nHighly intelligent people will simply experience significantly more rejection literally because they're more intelligent and express themselves more logically. Now, I don't know about you, but that certainly seems like an issue with other people.\r\n\n------------------------------\r\n\nIn reply to this comment:\n\nSure, it's like that everywhere. However, that doesn't mean that such an attitude towards those in the minority is necessarily appropriate.\n\n------------------------------\r\n\nSometimes I feel the same way, but then again, I'm sure some neurotypicals wish they were autistic at times.\n\n------------------------------\r\n\nRight. But again, that's more or less assuming that correlation equals causation. Certain difficulties can be exaggerated by you being autistic, but at the same time, that doesn't necessarily mean that being autistic is to blame for them existing in the first place.\n\nSince autism is essentially your entire personality, aren't you then technically blaming yourself?", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "Saturn", "channel": "UCbWdorbY36g0bimEqj78sPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSrRjwh1vvTxqMdh7uDwWUd04GZrKTMfqF6TsMeWg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Contrary to what BLM says, anti-black racism in America today isn't as bad as BLM makes it out to be and that Blexit has pointed out problems within the black community that has been a factor in holding the community back such as black-on-black crime and the lack of fathers in households. \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuT-g9amfPw \r\n\r\n<You don't necessarily have to blame anything. Although, driving vehicles is something being autistic causes deficiencies in for some individuals.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, humans aren't made to drive vehicles, therefore, I believe blaming being autistic is illogical, as when autistic neurology evolved, there were absolutely no vehicles to be driven at the time.>\r\n\r\nAnd humans aren't natural swimmers either. And I believe all human beings (even within the Autism community) are created differently and not equal. In the case of driving, some people have managed to adapt and learn to drive while others never did or have but just don't drive well. In my case, I feel my disability made it more difficult than normal to learn how to drive compared to my neurotypical younger brother who already has his own license. I will also say my lack of motivation to do so also played a part. However, I also feel my lack of motivation arose when I was in college and too used to a college-rest routine hence I was too used to studying on a daily basis and using my limited interest as an escape to even think about driving hence I see that as a another connection to my disability. Not to mention my lack of trust in myself in the idea of being responsible for a car. In essence, it doesn't entirely make sense for me to blame my struggle to drive on human nature as a whole considering all humans are different regarding who they are and how they adapt to changes over time. I suggest watching this interesting part of a lecture that does a good job explaining how humans aren't born equal:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAEdgPRpvkU\r\n\r\n<Blaming society doesn't mean that one ignores that they can improve on their weaknesses. Just like everyone, even neurotypicals, we have to improve on our weaknesses because of our neurology. Similarly, neurotypicals also have to improve on some of their weaknesses in life because of their neurology. It goes both ways.\r\n\r\nLike I said; I acknowledge that I have weaknesses, and that I even work to improve them. That doesn't mean I can't acknowledge the objectivity of autism falling under the social model of disability, mostly due to how society is structured for the majority.\r\n\r\nI know society is what primarily restricts me, yet I still work around that.>\r\n\r\nAnd for some people on the Spectrum, it can be overwhelming to work around it and their disability makes it just as hard if not harder than society makes it hard.\n\r\n<I also simply don't see the logic in blaming a type of neurodivergence for issues when that specific type of neurodivergence is what has contributed to many of society's technological developments.>\r\n\r\nAnd how do you know that Autism was the main driving force and not a correlation rather than an outside variable such as being homeschooled, properly mentored, or something environmental?\r\n\r\n<\"Europe PMC - Talent in autism: hyper-systemizing, hyper-attention to detail and sensory hypersensitivity\" - enhanced systemizing, attention to detail, and sensory sensitivity due to ASC.>\r\n\r\nOkay I admit I do have attention to detail and while I experienced benefits, I do experience struggles with it. \r\nI also noticed in one of the other studies you mentioned noted in the end that STEM students have more Autistic traits than those in social sciences in humanities and interestingly enough, my degree is in social science. rather than STEM.\n\r\n<You know, the typical overly-analytical mindset that causes them to not fit in? Or other mindsets, such as being overly-attentive to bigger and smaller details, of which may also cause them to appear abnormal in social contexts.\r\n\r\nHighly intelligent people will simply experience significantly more rejection literally because they're more intelligent and express themselves more logically. Now, I don't know about you, but that certainly seems like an issue with other people.> \r\n\r\nI haven't experienced rejection for anything like that or heard of it for other people on the Spectrum. Have you yourself experienced it? If anything, my social skills and my reaction to noises are what stood me out from the crowd rather than my intelligence.\r\n\r\n<Sure, it's like that everywhere. However, that doesn't mean that such an attitude towards those in the minority is necessarily appropriate>\r\n\r\nBasically one of the reasons why I'm against the new normal and why people should be skeptical of it. It just creates another culture of conformity where the people who don't conform are targeted in addition to the fact that it goes against human nature and violates human rights for everyone regardless of their background. \r\n\r\n<Sometimes I feel the same way, but then again, I'm sure some neurotypicals wish they were autistic at times.>\r\n\r\nThen if that's true (which I haven't heard a neurotypical think that way yet), it's cause the media, especially Greta Thunberg, tends to romanticize it nowadays and a lot of people link it with intelligence and suspect historical figures have it while not acknowledging the fact that it is a Spectrum and that the severe forms of it are ones that can make life a major struggle for the individual and their families and peers. This in turn causes people to make an association and assume Autism was the main driving force behind their intelligence and success and think that becoming Autistic will make you the next Einstein or whatever historical genius they can think of.\r\n\r\n<Since autism is essentially your entire personality, aren't you then technically blaming yourself?>\r\n\r\nI don't see my disability as something that defines me nor my entire personality. I see it as a part of me that has an effect on my daily life and now since thankfully I'm not in college anymore, I'm looking to improve my weaknesses and myself as a person and discover talents and see how I can put them to good use. So I do somewhat blame myself since I recognize I am at fault for some things and I like to go into detail how I became at fault for things.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "Monotonous Insomniac", "channel": "UC_hhpa6q8KgSBwJwhGOK5kA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQva-1YYUIXdpy6FGdoaWtwVgaxIDXVNnKNXnw8=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgxHMupqzKNEnNyn_Ox4AaABAg.98xnOvsFk__9Dm15qiLzyi", "text": "¬†@Monotonous Insomniac¬† \n\nThen your stage fright seems valid.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe world isn't the United States. I'm not referring to discrimination in specific locations any more than I'm talking about such issues globally. I'm also using the discrimination these groups may receive as examples, not to assume that these groups are discriminated against constantly on a global scale. My point is simply that these groups are sometimes discriminated against because of the cultures common among them, and their cultures essentially develop their personality. \n\nHowever, these people clearly shouldn't normalise themselves for the mere sake of being misunderstood. People don't only need to understand these specific groups, but be more accepting of differences in general, as the primitive mindset of rejecting differences because they could be potential threats to group stability isn't required in modern society, nor does it have any logical benefit.\n\nFact of the matter is that those in any minority group are significantly more likely to be rejected. It can even get to the points of physical abuse merely because they're minority groups.\n\n------------------------------\n\nI'm merely pointing out that autism isn't the cause of these issues and merely exaggerates problems that already exist. If the cause of these problems were eliminated, then being autistic couldn't exaggerate them. However, I agree that being autistic can impair a persons ability to drive.\n\n------------------------------\n\nRight. And again, I'm not denying that being autistic can make it more difficult. I'm simply saying that society brings those issues into play in the first place.\n\n------------------------------\n\nI don't. However, considering the common advantages seen among the autistic population in relation to intellectual abilities, there's a very high chance that being autistic played a significant role.\n\n------------------------------\n\nWell, with one advantage comes a disadvantage. It's how humans work. We sacrifice certain areas to improve others.\n\nThere are always exceptions. You just so happen to be an outlier, and that's fine.\n\n------------------------------\n\nIt's essentially just me trying to prove that differences aren't often very well accepted if they're significant. However, in personal experience, I've spoken to several people that are seemingly of high intelligence, yet with no diagnosed neurological or mental conditions, and the majority report poor social experiences, more specifically relating to being accepted. They simply didn't fit in with their hardcore logical mindsets.\n\nNow, even though I'm autistic, I have personally experienced rejection for being overly-analytical. I've had many people aggressively ask why I have to make things more complicated than they are, which has led to social rejection. Barely anyone I've met seems to tolerate me being overly-analytical. In all honesty, I'm lucky to be introverted, but it's still annoying to know that people possess such mindsets when they reject others.\n\nYour culture may simply be different to the one I live in.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe thing with neurotypical humans is that they constantly claim that we need to move away from normalcy, yet go on to create a broader definition of normalcy that people still have to fit in for them to be accepted. Witnessing this behaviour has made me suicidal in the past. Of course, even autistic people do that to a certain extent, but nowhere near on the level of significance of what's often seen in the neurotypical population.\n\n------------------------------\n\nNot necessarily. Whilst false stereotypes of autism still exist, there are genuine advantages present in most of us that some neurotypical people wish they had.\n\nI've had one or two people say that they were jealous of my ability to notice small details and compile research data efficiently, and then have stated that they wish to be autistic at times. And no, that's not me trying to boost my ego; I'm saying that I personally know of some people that genuinely wish they were autistic.\n\n------------------------------\n\nWhilst I understand your point of view, I don't perceive it to be objectively truthful. Autism is your entire brain, shapes every thought process, influences your preferred interests, alters your social skills, alters your perception of various details, reduces intuition, enhances logical ability, and changes your preference for people. Objectively, autism is quite literally your entire personality. Without being autistic, you'd be nowhere near the person you are currently. Whilst you can believe otherwise, it's not necessarily possible to change the fact that you're essentially what autism is.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Saturn", "channel": "UCbWdorbY36g0bimEqj78sPw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSrRjwh1vvTxqMdh7uDwWUd04GZrKTMfqF6TsMeWg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyMvdPnL2btmie4ud94AaABAg", "text": "God Bless Greta...but I am very skeptical about her Asperger's diagnosis.  I have been a practicing speech pathologist for 49 years and have observed many children on the Autism Spectrum.  From listening to this interview I observed the following to support my skepticism:  excellent eye contact, topic appropriate and accurate responses to questions, topic maintenance, no ritualistic or perseverative terms/language, appropriate facial expression, sense of humor (giggled appropriately), picked up on social cues,  emotion and empathy, understanding and use of figurative language, no idiosyncratic terms or word repetitions, prosody, intonational pattern and pitch within normal limits. NOTHING AT ALL TO INDICATE ASPERGER S.   Here's what I DO  concede: she is extremely verbose/and possibly OCD with climate change, but that alone does not constitute a diagnosis of Asperger's.

{"cid": "Ugy8kmrB2_Nopx8pknt4AaABAg", "text": "Climate emergency: world 'may have crossed tipping points‚Äô\n\nWarning of ‚Äòexistential threat to civilisation‚Äô as impacts lead to cascade of unstoppable events\n\nThe world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points, according to a stark warning from scientists. This risk is ‚Äúan existential threat to civilisation‚Äù, they say, meaning ‚Äúwe are in a state of planetary emergency‚Äù.\n\nTipping points are reached when particular impacts of global heating become unstoppable, such as the runaway loss of ice sheets or forests. In the past, extreme heating of 5C was thought necessary to pass tipping points, but the latest evidence suggests this could happen between 1C and 2C.\n\nThe planet has already heated by 1C and the temperature is certain to rise further, due to past emissions and because greenhouse gas levels are still rising. The scientists further warn that one tipping point, such as the release of methane from thawing permafrost, may fuel others, leading to a cascade.\n\nThe researchers, writing in a commentary article in the journal Nature, acknowledge that the complex science of tipping points means great uncertainty remains. But they say the potential damage from the tipping points is so big and the time to act so short, that ‚Äúto err on the side of danger is not a responsible option‚Äù. They call for urgent international action.\n\n‚ÄúA saving grace is that the rate at which damage accumulates from tipping could still be under our control to some extent,‚Äù they write. ‚ÄúThe stability and resilience of our planet is in peril. International action ‚Äì not just words ‚Äì must reflect this.‚Äù\n\nProf Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter, the lead author of the article, said: ‚ÄúWe might already have crossed the threshold for a cascade of interrelated tipping points. The simple version is the schoolkids [striking for climate action] are right: we are seeing potentially irreversible changes in the climate system under way, or very close.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs a scientist, I just want to tell it how it is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is not trying to be alarmist, but trying to treat the whole climate change problem as a risk management problem. It is what I consider the common sense way.‚Äù\n\nPhil Williamson at the University of East Anglia, who did not contribute to the article, said: ‚ÄúThe prognosis by Tim Lenton and colleagues is, unfortunately, fully plausible: that we might have already lost control of the Earth‚Äôs climate.‚Äù\n\nThe new article comes as the UN warns action is very far from stopping global temperature rise, with the world currently on track for 3C-4C. The commentary lists nine tipping points that may have been activated.\n\n‚ÄúWe have this alarming evidence that part of the west Antarctic ice sheet may be in irreversible retreat,‚Äù said Lenton. ‚ÄúAll the signals are that it is.‚Äù A similar situation appears to be occurring at the Wilkes basin in east Antarctica. The collapse of these ice sheets would eventually raise sea level by many metres.\n\nThe massive Greenland ice sheet was melting at an accelerating rate, the scientists said, while Arctic sea ice is shrinking fast. ‚ÄúPermafrost across the Arctic is beginning to irreversibly thaw and release carbon dioxide and methane,‚Äù they said.\n\nThe Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic, which warms Europe, has also slowed by 15% since the mid-20th century. ‚ÄúThat is just about in the range of natural variability, but it is also hard to rule out that it is part of a longer downturn,‚Äù Lenton said.\n\nThe scientists report that 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been lost since 1970. The tipping point, where loss of forest leads to it drying out, could lie in the range 20%-40%, they said. In temperate forests, especially in North America, heating has triggered more fires and pest outbreaks, potentially turning some regions from a sink for carbon to a source. In the tropics, corals are predicted to be wiped out by 2C of heating.\n\nA cascade of tipping points could occur because, for example, the melting of Arctic sea ice amplifies heating by exposing dark ocean that absorbs more sunlight. That may increase the melting of Greenland ice and permafrost areas. ‚ÄúMultiple risks can interact, with one change reinforcing another, and with warming of just a degree or two sufficient to result in dramatic cascading effects,‚Äù said Williamson.\n\nProf Martin Siegert, at Imperial College London, said: ‚ÄúThe new work is valuable. They are being a little speculative, but maybe you need to be.‚Äù He pointed out that the extremely rapid rate at which CO2 was being pumped into the atmosphere was unlikely to have ever occurred on Earth before. ‚ÄúIt may mean that tipping points can occur in unexpected ways as there is no geological precedent for this rate of CO2 change.‚Äù\n\nThe article reports that preliminary results from the latest climate models suggest global heating will be greater than expected, increasing the risk of tipping points. Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, disagreed on that point. However, he added: ‚ÄúI completely endorse their call for action. Although possibly low probability, the risks they identify are real.‚Äù\n\nLenton said action would still have real benefits, by slowing the impacts and giving more time for people to adapt. He said: ‚ÄúThis article is not meant to be a counsel of despair. If we want to avoid the worst of these bad climate tipping points, we need to activate some positive social and economic tipping points [such as renewable energy] towards what should ultimately be a happier, flourishing, sustainable future for the generations to come.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/climate-emergency-world-may-have-crossed-tipping-points?utm_term=RWRpdG9yaWFsX0d1YXJkaWFuVG9kYXlVS19XZWVrZGF5cy0xOTExMjg%3D&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=GuardianTodayUK&CMP=GTUK_email", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "nigglenoo", "channel": "UC5jxtF7qBUIRjefB5D0OWGA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTkSMjEi41LMD-KHwr6vPPixOg7jESONaUq_wS24Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx68504PscFEnlgmOZ4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Nowadays subbotniks still exist as voluntary events. NOT INSTEAD OF THE LESSONS, but on weekends or at any other free time. At her age, we studied and helped adults, and we do not feel that our childhood was stolen. As children grow, they have not only rights, but also responsibilities according to their capabilities.\nSo dear Greta, do not learn to be a hypocrite by blaming people for their economic development and, at the same time, voyaging on an expensive yacht made of modern materials. Instead of your empty talks, take a spade, plant trees and collect garbage WITH YOUR OWN HANDS AFTER SCHOOL, NOT INSTEAD of it. You are not a little child any more, you already MUST do something, and not only demand it from others.

What about their dreams and childhood?\nShe's clearly growing up in a prosperous country and has the luxury to skip school and speak before the U.N., while a lot of kids her age around the world don't even have a school to skip.\n\n\nEventhough climate change is a fact and should be ignored, people must not forget that she has several mental conditions.... no offense meant here; but it's a fact that also cannot be ignored.\nShe has OCD, Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and autism and while this doesnt make her any less of a person; it must be taken into account that it does affect her rationality, logic and reasoning.\nHer ideas are very biased and rigid (black-and-white thinking) and if people will follow that example and she gets her way, then we will only replace one problem with another and the global support for measures on climate change will deteriorate.\n\n\nShe brought her message, she repeated it over and over again...  it's in people's system now.\nNow it's time for governments to take over the concept and continue with reasoning and logic; while it's time to protect Greta from herself and the activists that (ab)use her as a spokesperson.\nShe's 16 y/o, she should be in school and she needs guidance to look after her mental health, let the grown ups take it from here and within a few years she can be proud of the improvements that were made thanks to her.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "sarin82", "channel": "UC4DW9S1_eV7uGC46fGpgbFw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQUdw2teBjgjYObk-oGSrupduxdauORqjjJRe4q2A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As I have been saying though, she is terrorized. She has been terrorized just like so many of us...myself included. I assure you, when I saw Al Gore‚Äôs ‚ÄúInconvenient Truth‚Äù years ago, I became obsessed with global warming. But I have an obsessive personality...just like young Greta has. I believed Al Gore, but that was before I knew who he really was and who pulls his strings. He‚Äôs a globalist puppet. He‚Äôs a puppet for central bankers and other power-crazed sociopaths who intend to tax the power completely out of the people until they are ripe for takeover...and that is exactly what they intend to do...take us over, exterminate those they don‚Äôt want in their new society...a one world order where one class of people will rule over the other. This scheme has been going on for well over 100 years...passed down from generation to generation in certain powerful families who dictate policy. You‚Äôve heard of the Bilderberg group. You‚Äôve heard of the Illuminati. You‚Äôve heard of the Rothschild family and so many of the other families involved in this plan to dominate and control the world.   Socialism is but another part of the scheme (or a tool) they are using to gain control of us....sold to societies with a nice big bow and pretty wrapping...but it‚Äôs the exact opposite of what God had in mind for us...and what America (the shining beacon of freedom) was founded on. The result of Socialism is a society of people who are fully dependent on the government to meet their daily needs. That puts those that control the government in charge of your destiny and survival. Step out of line, any line that ‚Äúthey‚Äù establish, and you suffer, your family suffers, and you may very well just be exterminated...for something as simple as planting your own garden. Sweden has fallen victim to the lies...and they have embraced socialism. Their children are being brainwashed relentlessly now and the Swedish people are not fighting back. Greta is a victim of this terrorizing and brainwashing and comes here to America to meet in front of world leaders and cry for help..and pull at your heartstrings to draw you into the same situation her countrymen are in. Sweden has fallen...and only a fool would take the word of their citizens  seriously now. That‚Äôs why Trump walked right past her the other day and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge her. He knows. Now you know. We need unbiased unsponsored science to make an educated decision. All the samples of that kind of research have given us the same news....that there is nothing to worry about and nothing we can do to stop what the climate is doing...on its own.

{"cid": "UgwI_dGoSCXBVYibKIp4AaABAg", "text": "Bible Language ‚Äì Volume 44\n\nSea Level Engineering\n\nBeloved in Christ Jesus Daniel the prophet who was captured by the Babylonians said that in the last days of this world scientists and geologists will be unable to predict the changes and destructions in the sky and the earth and will tear their clothes and run helter & skelter. Whatever they predict will be incorrect and the end will be desolation and destruction. In today‚Äôs world scientists, geologist & astrologers were earlier claiming that the end of the world would require millions of years however, now they also claim that it may be in a few centuries so they advised that mankind should move to another earth like planet. Now they claim that the climate has changed, deforestation has been done to create bigger and new cities, ozone layer has been breached, the industrial waste and plastic generated by man, pollution caused by vehicles, fresh water and sea water have contaminated which has given rise to Global warming. They also claim that due to this the icy poles of the earth are fast melting and the sea level has risen alarmingly which may submerge many island and cities very soon. \n\nThe reasons given by the scientist for global warming are untrue. When I was young I was taught by my teacher Ms.Teresa that the pollution caused by vehicles, industries or fire would rise up and the pollutants in the air would be brought down to the earth by rains and would turn to dust giving rise to fresh air once again. The scientist, engineers and others who in the process of covering their mistakes are prophesying a false news. If we drop a square feet sized stone into the sea it would displace approximately five litres of water however, the engineers, scientists and geologists have created mighty bridges, tunnels, canals, harbours, artificial islands, tourism places by dumping million & billion tonnes of steel, concrete, stones into the depths of the ocean and have made the sea level rise drastically. Millions of vessels like cruise ship, warship, cargo, submarines, coast guards, fishing vessels etc also add to the rise in sea level. There is no information or discussion about these factors which affect the sea level from any source.By hiding these facts and showcasing other facts these people are hindering the real growth of mankind by preventing God‚Äôs plan of progress of mankind which is against the will of God. \nGod said to adam and eve to go forth and multiply and live harmoniously in the world. God bestowed his wisdom upon Man to create and invent things to help him in his day to day living and was pleased with it. But God hated the sins of mankind like idol worship, rituals, superstitious beliefs. The inventions of mankind have been through the intervention of the holy spirit and these are to not to save the earth from any destruction or to protect nature but to empower mankind to fight and stand against thepowers of evil or aliens rising from the sky in order to protect mankind. Man created nuclear weapons however, is living under the fear of the same worried about the nuclear war. However, nuclear products were created by the will of God as the right usage of these can be used to bring together asteroids and meteors which are circling the solar system and create another planet or even another solar system which can be habitable for mankind. These weapons can also be used to grow the size of the earth or use them to either shrink or increase the water bodies in a similar way. Space capsules can be invented which can be powered by nuclear power which can travel to Mars and return in a few days or even create a habitable space there. These are possible only by the mercy of God the Father and His Son our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus said what is impossible for Man is possible for God. But this earth and its nature are not permanent for mankind and many prophets had predicted the destruction of earth in two thousand years. However, many religious fanatics, followers of casteism and geniuses of this world insulted them and killed very many of them. Christian missionaries and evangelists who preached about the destruction, judgement day and repentance said that Christ Himself will come to rescue you from this world and take you to a new place to give to an eternal life. Such preachers were hunted down and their blood was smeared over their countries and cities and monuments were built in their remembrance. \nDespite their wrong doings now the same people are only highlighting the fires of the Amazon forest, the melting of snow in the Artic and Antarctica, Tsunamis, hurricanes with brute force, solar flares and increasing levels of the sea the leaders along with their bunch of scientists and advisors are lamenting on stages set over high mountains.\nBeloved there is no feeling of security among men as even children are brutally killed. Christian Missionaries who are preaching peace, harmony, repentance and forgiveness in places filled with casteism, religious disharmony and racial abuses are being killed and the people of those places are themselves becoming witnesses to their own self destruction as the fury of nature has widely opened its mouth to devour them. Beginning from the blood of Abel son of Adam which was spilt on the earth till the blood of the innocents spilt in the churches of Sri Lanka have now risen to worsen  the anger of God. In the days of the coming of Christ all towns and hills will be levelled and destroyed as Christ said to Christians that when these destructions and natural calamities will happen you should raise your chest, lift your head, jump with joy and live cheerfully as there are many rooms in my Father‚Äôs house and I am going there to prepare a place for you and will come back to take you there. Therefore do not be afraid of these destructions and calamities but be awake and pray and wait for my coming because like the way how the world was destroyed during the times of Lot & Noah this world will be destroyed.

And the female can only have a child between the ages of 20 and 35 no sooner or no later.\n\n\n what would this accomplish.\n1)  It would eradicate child poverty for a start,  it would protect millions of children from being forced into poverty.\n\n\n2) There would be no child, teenager, single woman, homeless or unemployed woman having children all one wanting children and of full-time job at the same time women will choose,   because it's their free choice to have children it's not forced upon them,  so if they make the choice to have a child then they will become a full-time mother to the child.\n\n\n3)  This would eradicate  over 90% of our crime which comes from poverty which women create by bringing a child into an unsuitable environment.\n\n\n3) This would slowly reduce the world human population , and you would do this by solving the problems you are infested with which is child poverty the crime that it breeds and the overpopulation that comes from endless multiplying into a space that is not endless.\n\n\n It is the human female that is causing overpopulation,  because she's the one that has children,  in all the civilised  countries of the world,  it is a woman who decides when sex takes place not man,  it is the woman who decides if she gets pregnant whether that pregnancies is terminated or taken to full term,  and it is the woman who decides which environment that child should be born into,  and it is the woman who decides how many children she is going to bring into that environment.  \n\n\nSo it is woman that is creating child poverty, crime that comes from that poverty and an overpopulated world.\n\n\nBecause it is the human female, just like all females, they are the ones that either reduce the number of their spaces, increase it or stabilise it not the male.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe Wood", "channel": "UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS63NstucXB0MVoeIK6xdTFv10Y25HdWiVl8hqH6A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There was in fact a period of time called the Mediaeval Warm Period which was a period of progress and prosperity. It lasted from the mid 10th century to the mid 13th century. Varieties of grape suitable for making red wine were successfully grown in England at this time.\nWe  later had a prolongued cold period called the \"Little Ice Age\" when \"frost fairs\" were regularly held on the frozen ice of the Thames and other northern European rivers  from the 17th century to the beginning of the nineteenth century. \nDramatic climate changes have happened historically without human activity being a significant factor.

They now routinely have flooding on sunny days and have spent billions on water pumping systems as a result.  The temperature has also gone up, it's not hard to measure.  What you're witnessing outside btw is called weather.  So far the planet's temperature has only increased by around 1 degree, which is not something your body can perceive!  But for the entire planet, small differences matter.  Think about the difference between a career .275 hitter vs career .300 hitter in baseball.  On any given day the .300 hitter can go hitless and the .275 hitter can get 3 hits.  The .275 hitter might even have a higher batting average than the .300 hitter in a given season!  If you just watched each player hit - without keeping track - it would be very difficult to notice which player is recording more hits.  The difference is only 1 extra hit for every 40 at bats!  This is similar to the type of temperature increase we're experiencing.  It's hard to tell the difference between 57 degrees farenheit and 59 degrees, but on a planetary scale it has major effects!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Noah Baron", "channel": "UCVdO7OrRlF7A72occabN-xA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT2Nk6hRWO-fsX7iDszXtwwPYOlraduZqMgWtcPZg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It was Greta who studied the evidence presented by the climate scientists, and educated her parents and sister on the subject. Yes, she did go through depression when she realized the enormity of the issue. But, Greta changed the entire lifestyle of her family. They became environmentally-conscious and vegetarians. Her parents scaled back their careers and stopped travelling by air. Her father is now heavily involved with Greta's climate activist work. It's been Greta running the show from the beginning. People tend to judge Greta by her youth and unassuming demeanor, and therefore they vastly underestimate her integrity, intellect, and drive. She is a child in years only.

Um...where to begin.\nWell, lets start out with your first claim that climate change is man made i a hoax. Science have clear evidence that global warming is man made. Earth‚Äôs temperatures are currently warming 20 to 50 times faster than when the planet exits an ice age, for example. No natural cycle can account for the current rapid global warming. This theory, and I assume you know what the word \"theory\" means in world of science, is agreed upon in the science community. You claim about falsifying data, yes it has happened a few times that data has been distorted. But the major bulk of the data, at least the data that the IPCC has taken part of, is 100% validated. If you dispute that, you have the burden of proof.\nThe world is also full of signs of human made climate change. In its Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC, the  group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.\nPlease read the report, its right here: https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/\nAlso, your examples of historical foolishness does not apply to my arguements. Not any of the examples you mentioned could back up their theories with science. The drilling of holes to release spirits sounds more religous and ocult than anything else, so I am sure you agree the example is not the best.  \nFor your own and your childrens future, I hope you do read the IPCC reports.

The problem is that it will cost trillions of dollars over decades to effectively deal with climate change and only governments have that kind of money. Electric power plants that burn fossil fuels will have to integrate CO2 capture modifications; CO2 removal plants will have to be built all around the world; fossil fuels will have to be gradually phased out and renewable energy infrastructure phased in. And though the US government is well aware of the crisis, it won't act until a massive number of people (voters) wake up to the danger and push for action. Therefore, the climate activists are absolutely trying to persuade more people to join the cause. If you choose not, then don't. But, without urgent action, we will see mass migrations away from drought-stricken and flooded regions; famine on a biblical scale; mass extinctions of plants, insects, and animals; and conflicts over the world's remaining resources.
