They would cover Biden‚Äôs crimes for Biden‚Äôs silence, which was easy for Biden to do. \nNo, I really don‚Äôt think RFKJr. is too thrilled with Biden...unless all he listens to is CNN.

Outlaw Technocrats Are Stealing Our Democracy¬†¬†\n\"As soon as they get hold of the levers of authority, tyrants impose Orwellian censorship and begin gaslighting dissenters. But ultimately they seek to abolish all forms of creative thinking and self-expression. They burn books, destroy art, kill writers,\"\n\nKennedy turns out to be one of these tyrants because he banned me from writing on the Defender my opinions about quantum physics. I wrote like everyone else except --- I had found out about quantum physics from reading the last 40 years that none of us is physical or solid. Energy is our existence or we would not have electricity. Without this electrical grid/matrix we exist within, that we are being created from, we, our images, would not exist here either. It is this grid/matrix that makes us all ONE, that big ONE that people call God and I call INTELLIGENCE. Nonlocality HAS been proven.\nFrom the book THE QUANTUM WORLD written by the physicist Kenneth Ford are these words: 'magically bursting forth are quarks spinning billions of times a second as 3 points of light forming protons and neutrons\". From the book HANDS OF LIGHT written by the physicist Barbara Brennan are these words: \"we are eternal, electromagnetic, multidimensional, holographic energy and light beings\".¬†\nThese tyrants that Kennedy speaks of, that treat the whole world so badly, do not know this. I guess that 99% of the world does not know that they are electrical energy fields just like the 7 billion billion billion atoms they consist of. Since we ARE electrical energy fields, we are holograms because these electrical energy fields must project our images every bit as much as the projected images on a computer screen or video. Since we ARE images or super complicated holograms, then those quarks/atoms are spinning/vibrating with such a superior preciseness that only an INTELLIGENCE could create these complicated patterns of light that we are. Even the most expensive machine on earth with all its spinning/vibrating parts takes INTELLIGENCE to build, so why wouldn't we take such an INTELLIGENCE, such a superior consciousness to create us?\nPlease don't act like a tyrant towards me Kennedy. I want to solve the wars and prisons and other tortures on earth as much as you do because I was severely abused as a child by these tyrants. That makes me handicapped because of the way I think. I had a NDE or near death experience as a child because of that abuse, so I became aware of another dimension at that time.

Wow, I did not make the connection with the policy change you mentioned in that same year where Vaccine makers cannot be sued. I went on to work in pediatrics and burned every bridge because of my \"holistic\" attitude.I watched the rate of autism rise drastically and heard from countless mothers who knew how their children had been affected after vaccination and I listened to them as they spoke with both \"intuition\" and at the same time, doubting themselves in the smog of what became popular opinion. I did not have children because of this sick society and overpopulation but most of my friends at the time did not vaccinate their children citing religious reasons. These children have grown to become very robust people who contribute to society in positive ways. when medicine became For Profit, I had to chase some form of quality care out of hospitals to out-patient facilities until they were bought up by giant companies who are terrifying in their greed. I use Holistic physicians and take personal responsibility for my own health having gotten myself through several big deal illnesses and watched these physicians harassed and worse.These are such scary times and people need to be educated so that they can make good decisions and begin to trust themselves to make them.

According to the physicist Barbara Brennan we are holograms and the whole universe is a neutral holodeck. That means those patents associated with corona virus are created on purpose. Just like we are being created on purpose. \nThat also means your spasmodic dysphonia is being created by you on purpose. Is it fear of the words you are saying? NOne of us die.

I had a DPT/MMR booster in 2012 and a couple of days after getting it, I developed an itchy rash on genitalia and right calf, wrists and left ankle. I tried the OTC cortisone creams with no relief what so ever. When I finally went to a Dr. to find out what was causing the itching and patches, it was diagnosed as Lichen Planus. No known cause or cure. I started doing some research after 2 years and found the connection between the booster and Lichen Planus. I was using jasmine, peppermint, and lavender essential oils for relief and  was getting temporary relief. Then I finally went on a 3 day fast with pure water,  green tea and apple cider, and other herbal teas. At the end of the fast the itching was totally gone. The scarring on my wrists and calf remained. Baking soda and Epsom salts baths would also help. So after that discovery, I am doing all I can to share the dangers of vaccines and other drugs that have awful side effects, some worse than the disease they are supposedly preventing. Parents check up on vaccines before you go bowing down to demands that they take them. No one can force you to take anything that you feel is against your Constitutional and Civil Rights.

So even if we assume some compound in some vaccine created some years ago was found to be problematic, it would be replaced by a safer alternative or the use would be suspended if such an issue was identified.\n\nAlso note that many of the vaccine ingredients are reused in multiple similar vaccines, so if such issue existed with one ingredient, it would likely be visible and many vaccines would be affected. So it very unlikely such a situation would persist.\n\nTo move out of the assumptions and vague claims land into the concrete, do you have any specific substance and claims regarding their alleged long term problems which you can back up by some credible sources like observational studies?\n\nOn the matter of better alternatives, it is unethical to design any kind of test trial on people that does not offer the best available treatment as a baseline and such a trial would be typically rejected by all authorities that are overseeing the medication regulations and research has been done properly, correctly and according to the law.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "eddypdeb", "channel": "UClUAwm-0KlmPj5PY7gF5lMw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSYTpjTJaycKY0rTipwd9t8wtaDkA8u_-h5Qw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Most recent presidents came from David Rockefeller‚Äôs CFR or his trilateral committee while they ran against one another. Then they‚Äôd appoint high ranking officials from them. Epstein was in both. In David‚Äôs memoirs he said he worked with a secret cabal against the United States government. There‚Äôs pictures of him, Soros, Fauci, Gates Father, etc. In 2017 Fauci said we‚Äôd have a surprise outbreak during Trumps administration. Everyone is pointing fingers at him saying he worked with Wuhan. The United States has led the gain of function research since ww2. In 2019 he ran off with Gates and the WHO and paid fake news reporters to dress up and show empty grocery store shelves\n and reenact a corona virus pandemic. A journalist even sued the Obama administration, the WHO, the Rockefeller‚Äôs, the fbi, and the pharmaceutical companies claiming she found 72 kilos of contaminated vaccines and saying they were trying to create a nation wide lockdown with h1n1. David also wrote in his memoirs that he was thankful for the media not exposing his family and keeping their promise to them saying they couldn‚Äôt have done it without them and the world is now sophisticated enough for a one world government ruled by bankers. He and the pope helped get Hitler elected. They used him as a power grab. Man they even wrote about the holocaust in papers in 1823. They talked about it for over 100 years. They called it by name in ww1. Conditioning through trauma and fear. They then hired Germans into every government world wide and gave them high ranking positions. They blamed Hitler for their actions. They‚Äôve experimented on us since 1953 according to the cias website. Study mind control and brainwashing. They‚Äôve turned the world into a giant concentration camp and convinced people to go along with the Nuremberg trials all over again on a global scale. It isn‚Äôt a conspiracy theory. It‚Äôs real. Hitler didn‚Äôt create the idea of a master race and millions of people believed in it. They talk about it openly at Davos. Every president since Raegan talked about a new world order.

Look up everything I talked about. The head of the NSA literally quit his job before Snowden saying if we don‚Äôt get everyone in government out their goal was total population control. Now the wef has teamed up with Microsoft to release digital passes saying those that do not have them won‚Äôt be part of society. Why do you think they spied on every conversation simultaneously hmm?\n\nKlaus wrote in his book the 4rth industrial revolution will enable new technology that runs counter productive to free and open societies, brain scans to predict future crimes, and they‚Äôre going to replace cops with ai. He talked about technology to see into the hitherto of our minds saying they‚Äôll gain new ways to manipulate and control human behavior. After ww2 this ability increased significantly leading to Orwell and Huxley to say the things they said. It‚Äôs a natural progression of power. The Fed was also set up for this. They wanted humanity chasing a carrot on a stick while they got rich. Goldsilver hidden secrets of money episode 4. He spent over a million on that for pbs. The United Nations was literally created for this. Go study the history of banking and look up things past presidents said about them. The power struggle ended in 1914, if there even was one before that. The cia worked with pharmaceutical companies, corporations, radio, media, and big tech. They‚Äôve been manipulating people to keep giving up more and freedoms for a long time. They put drugs on the street and hen Biden created a police state sending them into poor neighborhoods calling for the death penalty. The pharmaceutical companies literally are behind the opioid crisis controlling rehabs. When white man first came he bright food that made people sick, and drugs to numb the pain. Billionaires always control both ends. Look where Gates money is. Number one farm land owner in America saying our food will be grown in a lab. They‚Äôre after the worlds. Agriculture and medicine, just like John did. It‚Äôs a control structure. It isn‚Äôt about health, it‚Äôs about money. They‚Äôve been cornering us for years. Corporations, pharmaceutical companies, billionaires, and politicians all want the same things. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre the only ones being empowered off this while the middle class dwindles. It was before this. Science proved lives are linked to the economy. Fauci admit it wasn‚Äôt air born in a meeting with Zuckerberg in late July. He admit 3 ft is just as good as 6. 6 was to destroy businesses. Cuomo wasn‚Äôt the only governor who sent sick people into nursing homes. They did it all over the country. This isn‚Äôt the only country either. By mid October half the count was hospital mistakes and nursing homes. Medicine was the third leading cause of death before last year. It would be number one of people were honest now. A nurse with a hidden camera proved they staged sick patients with healthy ones in the epicenter. She showed them putting healthy people on ventilators saying they were doing it for money. The media hired healthy people to pretend to be sick. Sweden came off the lowest deaths they‚Äôve had since 1977. They were promised a spike yet still did better than everyone else and they did nothing. England has 0 flu cases this year. If it‚Äôs because of masks it means they only block out lesser viruses reducing viral interference raising chances of covid. Considering I‚Äôve seen studies that prove this to be false, the only obvious answer is the testing is severely flawed. Which it is. This is a scam dude. They‚Äôve restricted the movements of healthy people raising the odds old people will get sick. They‚Äôve turned healthy patients away from hospitals. They destroyed small businesses all over the country. Dude.. you think anyone is paying attention to science? Epstein was friends with everyone in the scientific community. Universities helped the cia in mind control experiments. They‚Äôve been contributing highly to this fake debt money system and destroying the economy. Even Epstein funded Harvard proving how easy it is to influence institutions. The world is run by outside monetary interests with obligation to the United States. Much less public health. They‚Äôre creating a sicker society that‚Äôs easier controlled. Sperm rates dropped 50 percent in 50 years for a reason.\n\n‚ÄúThe only thing with blood money is there‚Äôs not enough of it.‚Äù\n\nSorry. You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.

It does not even test positive for influenza. \"increased chances of non- influenza infection\" is its highest side effect.. \nNow with the newer Messenger RNA types (modifies the genome with \"inserts\" and \"knockouts\") the most common side effects are lethal reactions to exposure to the wild type virus of the types used in the delivery and insert process. this is why no mrna type innoculation will ever be tested for effecacy against a genuine virus- it becomes lethal to be exposed for most test subjects.

{"cid": "UgzKPKY2rALNPKJW9el4AaABAg", "text": "I watched this with no prior beliefs or opinions about vaccinations -- if anything, I leaned toward the pro side of the debate. During this talk, starting just after the 18-minute mark, I was initially frustrated by the interviewer's reluctance to listen to RFK Jr when he spoke about vaccines (he asked the questions, but then seemed to scoff at or dismiss the responses), but I think his resistance actually ended up highlighting his own lack of knowledge about the topic while increasing the credibility and soundness of RFK Jr's statements. RFK Jr is not anti-vaccine, he is pro-safe-testing of vaccines (by independent regulators and scientists who are not working for or paid by the company that is marketing them) before they are used. His motivation is not to be right, only to ensure that millions and millions of people, most of the them children, are not being injected with toxic substances. Prior to 1989, children got 3 vaccines; currently, they are mandated to get 72, with unknown consequences. Facebook, Google and other media platforms have shut RFK Jr down. I feel great admiration for his intelligent perspective, hard work and courage as well as deep concern about the lack of impartial safety-testing done on the vaccinations that are currently being administered.

{"cid": "Ugz8PXAYunht1LO49yJ4AaABAg.9403oCwbLAe97klRVRbcxx", "text": "dislecksick   First off, I agree that the world indeed is not flat and there are quite a few ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù that are way out in left field.  With that out of the way, what do you consider to be relevant available literature?  In making that statement, it should typically be followed by references to support it.  And I‚Äôm not insulting, just simply asking.  Personally, I think anything one reads whether it be information from the CDC or FDA or any other source considered credible needs to be viewed objectively.  For example, that 1 out of 100 educated individual is going to read an official study to see where there might be holes.  They will check to see who benefits from the production and distribution of vaccines and how those folks were involved in the study itself.  The way I see it, any study on anything that directly involves those who may profit from it opposed to purely independent sources immediately becomes questionable.  GMO crops are a good current example.  Monsanto has had connections within the FDA for quite some time and the testing done on the effects of GMO‚Äôs was limited at best before their products that are in a very high percentage of food were approved.  But one can go read credible reports from sources such as the FDA and it will sound as though all proper steps were taken, no stone unturned.  When the reality is, they were no better than studies involving cigarettes which at one point were basically considered to be harmless and people smoked everywhere without really questioning it.  \n\nPoint being....there are a lot of Kooks out there but there is also a lot of data presented on certain topics that if you dive in a bit deeper to see who is involved, not everything adds up.  Not surprising a man who‚Äôs father and uncle were both killed under very questionable circumstances tends to question what he‚Äôs being told and what he‚Äôs reading versus what might actually be happening.  I mean, if nobody questions things, wouldn‚Äôt that make it quite simple to get away with just about anything?  Regarding Gates, when I start reading about technology to microchip humans for tracking purposes, I am going to question the motives of that technology to no end.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Mindfulness_ Is_Freedom", "channel": "UCW2AFubzlGTuMAE6mdBE1ow", "votes": "25", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/xw5K5RzHFXLEAALocDvFh44HbdijvkbozrzH3dw9DLbKtvJ2t_kJZavIbe99VzuywG5ANTZL_Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
