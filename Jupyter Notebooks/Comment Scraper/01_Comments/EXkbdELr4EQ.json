This is very different from what we are doing by taking carbon from underground and putting it in the air, a massive geophysical experiment that the ocean and terrestrial biosphere can only mitigate up to a point.

{"cid": "Ugy_TM9JJ89LJpIsXQZ4AaABAg", "text": "All plants are adapted to reflect heat, they are like space blankets in this respect, they are a huge factor in reflecting solar heat back out into space, the loss of forests negatively impacts the planets albedo, but so too does the loss of grasslands.  Grasslands are decimated by goats and sheep, which graze down to the root, killing the plant. By contrast other livestock is softer on the land.  Goats cause desertification. Without ground cover from small grasses, soils bake in the sun, and don’t retain moisture, the water table suffers, rivers and springs dry up, and aquifers don’t get replenished.  Goat and sheep management is absolutely critical!!!!!!!  The introduction of bison has even been found to exponentially reinvigorate grassland ecosystems.  Soil health is also key to all of this.  Soil health is the key metric around which we can gauge policy effects, and mitigation strategies.

It is known how to manually plant a polyculture of native diversity or a diversity of what will take, keeping in mind the natural spacing per species & given rapidity of climate changes. \n2. Mycorrhize roots from as local a source as possible, or specific to that species.\n3. Start planting outward from extant forests & where they were most recently cut down. \n4. Plant hillsides & mountain slopes for the piling up of transpiration into rainclouds. That will restore nature's hydrology.  \n5. Reforest down to the coasts to capture & sequester carbon, preventing it from slipping into the oceans, one of the best things we can do to aid ocean recovery.\n6. Forests are known to be best at stabilizing climate and what we face is climate chaos, so this labour intensive mass action is integral to all that's needed to restore fertility, needed to grow food & for food to grow for wildlife.\n7. Forests are a therapeutic setting & for e.g. conifer terpenes are known to boost immunity. \n8. You can still keep lumber flowing while ending clearcut logging & starting selection logging, preferably with horses that fertilize while making skid trails. This is real forest management, thinning the forest where too dense, not highgrading. Done in the spirit of stewardship will yield the rest of forest bounty, including foods, medicines, dyes, fibres, latex.

Glaciers are the culprits that steal water from the rain clouds.\nVolcanos  pump out more greenhouse gases in one eruption than the entirety of the industrial age. 1883 the year without a summer, was brought about by Krakatoa's release of billions of metric tons of greenhouse gases. In 1884 summer returned.\nWe are in one of the interglacial periods of the eath's cycle. Which means the earth has been warming for over 11,000 yrs. The average interval between Glaciers is 10K years. The Younger Dryas cooling was temporary, than it got warmer. When the earth cools and glaciers form; water is locked away causing droughts. Archaeologist have been finding human artifacts dating back to the Roman times under the melting glaciers in Norway. Where was the Ice Man found? Under a melting glacier.

{"cid": "Ugyvw9NwAs_SMOQTYAl4AaABAg", "text": "Very interesting.\nWhen you think about what we're doing (on a grand scale) : we're taking carbon from underground and turning it into a greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. If a tree can take that greenhouse carbon gas and turn it back into solid carbon, we could take that solid carbon and push it back into the ground. To do this as efficiently as possible, you could plant a tree and wait for it to mature to a point where its rate of growth has slowed (turned a large amount of CO2 into solid carbon) and at that point, the tree could be turned into a *product that would be subsequently buried, effectively sinking your carbon in the same way that it was initially before we extracted it. You would then replant a tree and restart the process.\n\nIn this way, you wouldn't simply be using the land to carbon sink once, but to continuously sink carbon back where it was before we interfered with it. I'm aware that such a process of burying a solid tree deep into the ground isn't something that is done (we do with CO2 gas however) but what I'm saying is we should try to mimic what nature has done over millions of years and we'll need to do it more efficiently, using renewable resources of course. And this would need to be done along with a serious and meaningful reduction of our carbon greenhouse gas production to have the quickest effect.\n\nSo yes, I do think that planting trees is a necessity and a vital key to our future existence. It's what we do with a mature tree that would need to be rethought.\n\nJust a thought.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "ThePilotGear", "channel": "UCXnadbk1WUknH7kzlriWZfg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQtD23YvdDgphQzTSU9y4uLcECj8VvTOyMXNQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We have brought a colossal amount of the first in the second thanks to the fossil energies, and to stop it to be stored under CO2 form, we hope trees may help us. The problem is, that to have the same amount or at leat a relatively sustainable level of CO2 with much more carbon in the atmospherical reservoir implies that a much, much larger part of carbon is stored under non-CO2 form in comparison with the pre-industrial era. A slight change of our societies makes this move more or less impossible : the world population has been multiplied by ten since, suffers less from hunger and has a plate share dominated by meat, wich requires lot of space to grow.\nAlso, the movement from atmoshere to geological stroring is slow, inexistant at our scale,wich means the solution as trees, stocking carbon in the atmospherical level are our only back-up, and when a forest is mature, it can't stock more. At the scale of the forest growth is hopefully a short scale in regard of what we desire to last, so this solution can only be provisory and with a limited impact, wich means : what about facing the problem we'll have to live with instead to flee ?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Nathan Guitaut", "channel": "UCzDY51LO5Kc9nZzd3GZitFA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRDNhwrKgedgn7LrAJRG2ckka7Z7d78P0JPRGGQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Nor you just leave the land alone so deserts grow larger and forests take 200 years to develop on their own... What you do is you use a Permaculture approach, and with the right mix of multiple species and succession planting you get yourself in 10 years a young forest well on its way to producing new springs, creeks and natural ponds. Forests are 90% water, and they will store underground up to 15 times the amount of water they support on the surface. Their biomass allows us to enjoy up to 15°C less under the canopy on a hot day, act as insulation around our homes in the winter and evergreens protect our land from wind erosion. Trees are natural and efficient water pumps, as opposed to any artificial ones which end up lowering the water table and salinizing the soil. If we all understood these and the many more benefits of forests (e.g. wildlife and flora support, water condensation, climate regulation, air purification, soil improvement, energetic purification, food production) we wouldn't have a choice but to go out there and plant and hug trees, treat them with respect and give them many thanks for giving us all they do.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "alotofusers", "channel": "UC8rYaAACuNpqx-xq_rIZRuA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRDm2QMws9sGU2e1USKr2povr-ln_bsd3winA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If all human beings were removed from the Terran equation, it would take centuries for the naturally formed forest cover to sink an amount of carbon equal to that released by the deforestation caused by the switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture and the subsequent rise in the human population. Apparently there are biofeedback mechanisms that can return the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to the 180 to 280 ppm range if it is elevated by, for example, large volcanic eruptions, but they operate over long time scales. It may be that we humans haven’t burnt such a large proportion of the total carbon sequestered as fossil fuels that those mechanisms will be ineffective, over millennia, at returning the Earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to the “un-modified” level.

{"cid": "UgwBCeA3ImyvEW0A5hl4AaABAg", "text": "IMHO Daily human activity has little influence of the current climate change. There is so grander influences than that of 7+ billion people and most of them don't have access to vehicles and electricity that use so called fossil fuels. (with some research you will find the oil is Not a fossil fuel and is generated by the Earth).\nPlanting trees is always a great act of combating the pollution in urbanized areas, however, just planting one species for acres and acres is a bit counter productive. Providing the life giving oxygen Is the only benefit yet at a huge risk for the environment.\nI feel strongly that the climate crisis is a huge misrepresentation of what is really going on. Had this been a real crisis, airlines would be mandated to STOP at least a few flights a month, permanently. Drilling and fracking for this pollutant would be slowed down, and the amount of plastics produced would also be cut down by tremendous amounts. Among other things.\nMassive industrial pollution has barely been addressed except for implementing a carbon tax which is a glorified game as the corporations polluting the most can purchase additional tax credits from corporations emitting less carbon dioxide..You see, the powers that shouldn't be are screwing over the gullable population at every opportunity. Any of you of a mature age will recall the new ice age scare of the 70's&80's toted as the next big crisis..NEVER happened. Yet this global warming \"crisis\" Had to be reworded as some of the intelligent among the masses pointed out that warming and cooling of the climate is a NATURAL cycle under the control of the SUN, not Man..\nThe use of the word Carbon in this clip is VERY misleading...Carbon is a mineral. It is the basis of all  LIFE in the Universe. Because of the lack of real education in the indoctrination centers, aka, public compulsory education it appears even basic science is ignored or extremely misrepresented to those unfortunates attending these institutions of dumbing down potentially great minds. \nThe carbon dioxide we humans produce is used by plants to grow! Why does this evade so many. The world is greener now due to this higher emissions. Don't believe a word of what I say here. RESEARCH for yourself.

{"cid": "UgzSwwDeKKRdKj6eWzN4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

{"cid": "UgxuqpvWr8qAM10jdIJ4AaABAg", "text": "20,000 years ago ALL of Canada and large swathes of United States, ALL of Scandinavia and large swathes of Russia and Northern Europe (including UK) were mostly devoid of life especially trees. After the glacial maximum 20,000 years ago the world started to rapidly warm and the great ice sheets retreated while the flora and fauna colonized all the lands that had been either, under the ice, or too cold and dry to support life. A vast greening took place which would have 'locked up' vast quantities of CO2 and yet the planet warmed. Equally the last time we were this warm was 120,000 years ago during the Eamian Interglacial. When the Eamian ended and the world grew colder and colder vast areas would have lost all Flora and Fauna thus releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere while the global avarage temp. dropped and stayed there until 20,000 years ago.  \nClearing trees while the earth is warm and in an interglacial will warm the surface and not because of the release of CO2 but because the sun can heat the surface directly and as soon as the surface is cleared. In addition losing tree cover will speed up water evaporation warming the surface further. Here is an account from 1865 which is about slavery but also describes the affect of clear felling forest in Brazil \n\"At six o'clock in the morning the overseer forces the poor slave, still exhausted from the evening's labors, to rise from his rude bed and proceed to his work. The first assignment of the season is the chopping down of the forests for the next year's planting, using a scythe to hack down the smaller trees. This work normally goes on for two months, depending upon the type of jungle being cut and the stamina of the slaves.\r\nThe next step is the destruction of the large trees, and this, like the previous work, continues for twelve hours each day. At night the slaves return home, where evening work of two or more hours awaits them, depending upon the character of the master. They set fire to the devastated jungle, and then they cut and stack the branches and smaller tree trunks which have escaped the fire and which, occupying the surface of the earth, could hinder development of the crop.\nThese mounds of branches are again burned, and the result is a sad and devastating scene! Centuries-old tree trunks which two months before had produced a cool, crisp atmosphere over a broad stretch of land, lie on the surface of a field ravaged by fire and covered with ashes, where the slaves are compelled to spend twelve hours under the hot sun of the equator, without a single tree to give them shelter.\r\nThis destruction of the forests has exhausted the soil, which in many places now produces nothing but grasses suitable for grazing cattle. The temperature has intensified, and the seasons have become irregular. The rains at times damage the crops, and at other times there is not rain at all. The streams and certain shallow rivers, such as the Itapucuru, have dried up or have become almost unnavigable, and lumber for building has become very rare, or is only found at a great distance from the settlements.\"", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Stephen Skinner", "channel": "UCz7jCiSQCIx-CQ97tU2BKgw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRhl9flzSM3LgNC5G9hUERN4zzS0woS7HFZFrqT4A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Restore Sustain Thrive is social-environmental development project here in Brazil. The main focus of the project is reforestation and the promotion of permaculture in the Atlantic forest (Mata Atlântica) region to the north of Rio de Janeiro. To get things started we are conducting a crowd funding campaign. We would greatly appreciate any assistance you can give and if you could distribute this to friends, family and to any individuals or organisations that you think may be able to assist. While we at Restore Sustain Thrive have been developing and planning RST projects for quite some time, the current situation in Brazil brings home the urgency of the need to protect and restore the forests here and the world over.

They take short rotation eucalyptus numbers to use as an example for carbon binding in mono-culture forest? Even you must have thought that to be a bit misleading. An average Norway spruce \"mono-culture\" rotation in Europe is something like 60 years. \n\n*Most planted forest store more carbon and faster then natural regenerated ones (specially in the northern hemisphere), simply because the species used grow faster and the coverage is higher. \n*Ireland was not the European country with the lowest forest cover at that time, that was Iceland.\n*Its true that short rotation stands (10-25 years) do release the carbon back into the air rather fast, some into paper, but often as fuel (Scandinavia has excelled at this) This fuel is then carbon neutral and new carbon is not added to the atmosphere with fossil fuel. Additionally, you have many short rotation stands. So on the average, even if you harvest one, there is always a huge amount of carbon being stored in others stands. You could of course just use the land for cattle grazing, would that be better?\n*You have three pillars of sustainability. Ecological, economical and social. Production forests are needed, whether sign holding folk like them or not. Ironically the signs they are holding were made from production forests, most often mono/duo-cultures. If Ireland does not want to produce their own timber products, it has to come from somewhere.\nOf course we need to cut fossil fuel emissions, but we don´t need people attacking one of our solutions just because its not perfect from every angle.\n*If landowners would be paid for their carbon sequestration, that would be an economic incentive, but like i mentioned, planted forests would still bind more so they would be the best option.\n\nThere are multiple other things to address but I´ll stop there.

{"cid": "Ugzx7Fn9juxp2yIg9Kt4AaABAg", "text": "A few questions. \n\n1) how does compositing into soil be bad for planet? It’s returning at least some of the nutrients from the paper back into the land that was extracted to make it in the first place. That is way more important then the tiny amount not converted to soil. Pretty sure that co2 is more due to decomposers at work to. Doubt it’s only a chemical process. Topsoil is kind of nessisary to restore lost natural forests and to make new ones. Got to scare people into not fertilizing the soil and composting because contrianism sells. And yeah I know run off but biology is equivalent exchange not a infinite crop dispensary; replenishing the soil is mandatory or else you get dust bowls and stunted plant life. You need good soil to start a cyclical habitat.\n\n2) due nothing. Sure avoid meaningless work to avoid unessisary carbon waste. Yes in some cases when nothing is going wrong do nothing. But invasive spicieses humans already did something to introduce are just going to establish a hazardous monoculture of their own without intervention because it was our intervention that caused the problem in the first place. Now their are neutral and even benifitial invasive spiecies but unless those are properly identified and you can be confident that their are no hazardous ones sure do nothing but you could speed things along yourself and that speed  is pretty much nessisary because the rate of habitat destruction is faster then the replenishment rate. This should be obvious because otherwise a problem would not exist! But yes duh non native and monoculture is mostly bad for habitat restoration; who would have thought. \n\n3) humanity needs resources not just for money. Sustainable tree farms is possible and unless they are just harvesting the burn into ashes I fail to see how that co2 becomes a net loss of which you might as well not replanted at all. They really should be spisific on the how and who; as though most these plantation just use them as firewood. (I already no some do but not all)\n\n4) not enough land to plant trees on to restore balance? Makes sense I guess co2 from underground was released into an already balanced system that has already been declining ever sense, but what future does that leave us? So what all that habitat humans have taken away should not be restored at all cause that sounds like doing nothing to me. Sorry nature https://youtu.be/PwwuYp5vVPI \nBut Restoring habitat is for your own good! \n\nDon’t compost, do nothing, and the earth will forever be strapped to mechines  to maintain order like she’s on fucking life support?! I know just planting trees won’t get us to stabilization but that’s obvious dude! Need useable information here like treating sequestered carbon like we do radioactive waste and burring the excess. After the surplus’s is gone and humanity goes net carbon neutral BOOM SALVATION! also perhaps use that 70% of surface area called the ocean maybe. Like artificial island/plantation boats? but no I guess we are doomed and should do nothing; the upfront cost is too great even though it could maintain neutrality.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Waste Less Learning", "channel": "UC39rUCvsQLJUOgMXfao5wYw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQM-_vS8q2Fzj8Kx_vhjp3nadQSFdODOUx81ylz=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxMWEJaErHrwwknCVN4AaABAg", "text": "This is the Disney version of environmentalism very much in line with Agenda 21 (the depopulation of the countryside and cramming the population into consumer tax milking farms or cities as most people know them). Permaculture is one possible way forward, I studied forestry and forest economics at uni and worked as a forest manager for a few years and became quite disillusioned with the unnatural and ecologically unsustainable mainstream approach to tree farming. It is the bean counters and narrow minded science based on economic return and tax incentives for the land owners that determine what species are economically viable and rarely take into consideration the eco services they provide, hence the vast swathes of monoculture plantations. Permaculture (permanent agriculture because we need to feed ourselves also) and forest gardens not only stabilise the soil and slow water run off, reduce albedo  and actually help with the hydrodynamics of the ecosystem but provides a wide variety of produce during all stages of growth by mimicking the natural layers of the ecosystem  with economically important canopy species that may provide an interim harvest of nuts for many years (nut oils, nut flour and the nuts) as well as a final timber crop, a sub canopy layer of say for example fruit trees, a shrub layer of soft fruits and berries, a herbaceous layer, a ground layer and a root layer can all be incorporated to grow interim and long term crops and finally a vine layer such as runner beans, grapes etc. All of which can be managed and harvested prior to canopy closure. Support species are also used, especially on seriously degraded land that have been poisoned and grazed to the point of desertification or degradation. This is a very brief description of permaculture, it is less mechanised and quite labour intensive so would require a vast number of ‘stewards’ to work and harvest the produce year round (massive employment opportunity for the right people) with huge diversity of produce so you haven’t got all your eggs in one basket, cell grazing can also be incorporated to maintain a lush ground flora. You can let your imagination run wild. The whole carbon issue is a red herring though. The famous ‘hockey stick’ graph which Michael Mann et. Al., gave us and is the foundation for all the carbon hysteria, (goodness knows how many times it was cited by the alleged 97% of climate scientists who back the CO2/global warming story) and the IPCC’s tax grab has never been independently verified or reproduced to the point that he spent (or rather his backers spent) millions of dollars on a defamation suit against a Dr. Tim Ball who basically called him a fraud. The case went on for eight years and was finally dismissed and Tim Ball was awarded court costs when Mann refused to allow his publicly funded research from Pennsylvania State University, including data, statistical method and computer models to be presented in court to prove his case for defamation. He even managed to loose the Medieval Warming Period with his statistical shenanigans! I’m not saying that climate change does not exist however. A weakening magnetosphere leading to increased cosmic ray penetration (increased cloud nucleation leading to cooling not warming, and an uptick in seismic activity) is leading to a destabilisation of the jet stream influencing the extreme weather conditions the planet is now experiencing. This is all cyclic, has happened before and will happen again and is largely influenced by solar activity. Yes we do need to address pollution and the way we treat this planet. We need to learn to interact with and understand our environment and ecosystems and let them work for us and not rape it for the out of control consumerism and profit motives of the corporatocracy.  \nPeople also argue the point with tree ring data which is not a reliable method of studying historical climate where a hot dry summer and a cold wet growing season can yield a similar result as well as varying from species to species, tree spacing etc., (I did study a bit of dendrochronology also).

It fulfills the water needs of 10 households in a cluster.  Without a doubt, a pond can easily be equated to ten such wells. \n\n\nThe water in ten ponds can be easily contained in a reservoir.  But then, a son (good, cultured, educated one specially), is no match to even ten such reservoirs!   Because, a child quenches the thirst of the parents, in a similar way!! But then, there is something that can even equal ten such sons!!  That is none other than a 'tree'.\n\n\nWhy is that?  How can 1 tree equal 10 sons or 100 reservoirs or 1000 ponds or 10,000 wells?!!!  Well... :), here's the deal. One tree in it's life time, holds in clouds that can equal all of the above bodies of water.  How about a son. How can a tree be better than him? It sure is, because, a person who plants it today will never know how many people shall benefit from that tree.  In reality, the true meaning of life is said to be - to plant trees, under whose shade one does not expect to sit! The many fruit the tree bears, shall satiate the hunger of birds/animal/people.  Many a rain clouds it might bring to the neighborhood and quench the thirst of the needy. When he plants the sapling, he is actually doing service to many beings without realizing. Moreover, the tree may live there for generations beyond the planter and his son and still keep serving the people, giving them water, shade and fruit. \n\n\nHence a tree is equated to so many things.  Then what does felling a tree mean? It means we are, with our own bare hands, although theoretically, slaying so many sons and drying up so many water sources! \n\n\nIt is said that trees are the best antiques and the groves were God's first temples.  Strive and save those antique temples now and always! \n\n\npada vigrahaH:\n\nदश-गृह समः कूपः दस कूपः -समा वापी दश-वापी-समो ह्रदः।\n\ndasha-griha samah kupaः dasa kUpa-samaa vaapI dasha-vaapI-samo hradaH|\n\n\nदश-ह्रद-समः पुत्रो दश-पुत्र समो द्रुमः ॥ \n\ndasa hruday samaः putra dasa putra samaः drumah।।", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ramakrishnan R", "channel": "UCf4ZQOJLHERy3xjRjrY5jXQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRiYsJVBeLcb9i5PqRIbIXG3XsAofD2Q-39GA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Anyone who has ever done extensive tree planting with a forest management program (such as myself) knows you are better off selecting a minimum of 12 species, and ideally double that... to avoid monoculture infestations that decimate your plantation. Additionally, the variety must include mostly local species so they thrive naturally, and fruit species for the local animals to thrive also. As for “harvesting every ten years lowering carbon sequestration”, that is also a crock if done correctly. You first cull weaker trees at 7 and 14 years, allowing stronger trees to expand and cover the areas previously occupied by weaker trees: thereby fortifying your forest. And as for a self- sustaining business concern, you pick trees to cut after 20 or 30 yrs and you don’t cut more than 1 or 2 percent of the trees you planted and replant new trees in their place right away... so your average tree will reach 50 to 100 yrs, you’ll never have land clearings, and your carbon sequestration will be minimally affected by the ongoing commercial concern. \n\nSimple as that.

That if the world went to the countries with the rainforests and said to them stop cutting down the trees. And we will pay the wages of thousands upon thousands of people in your country that have no jobs 20,000 a year to plant trees to reconstruct the rainforests.  In the way that you suggest.  That the issues around co2 could be reversed.   I have a belief that it would be cheaper for the world to reestablish the rainforests.  And employ hundreds of thousands of people that do not have jobs in these countries boosting their economies greater than beef production.  Than it would to continue with the renewables racket.

And I have witnessed how well intentioned financial aid and financial incentives, such as what you mention, end up being wasted through local corruption in third world countries. I have witnessed the lack of education and education without effectivity in these countries. So I’m afraid carbon credits and paying people for not producing anything (not cutting trees) is not sustainable. I believe education is the beginning (and there are many factors to address in that respect in poor and HOT countries). And after education,  they need to improve productivity and the hope and opportunity to improve your children’s future. The book “The Power of Productivity” is very clear on this. So, when it comes to reforestation, I believe the ideal situation is that not more than one percent of multi-species forests (and not in a batch but by selecting trees) are cut annually to be transformed into furniture and other products; thereby producing real jobs, real productivity, and a sustainable future. As far as I’ve witnessed, no matter how well intentioned government incentives are, their bureaucracy and potential for corrupt favoritism cannot compete with a free market economy. “Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.

I have never been involved in a timber company in order to determine what percentage they can live with processing. It may be 2%, 5%? It all depends on the size of their plantations, the size of their business, and the years their trees need to grow. Whichever is that number for each individual timber company, if they are going to have a sustainable business, they need to find the right balance for their forest vs demand. To put it another way, you cannot take all the fish out of the ocean if you want to have a sustainable fishing company... otherwise you’d be fishing yourself out of a job.

When a tree dies naturally the fungi and bacteria break it back down into CO2. The only way to prevent this recycling is to store the dead trees in an environment that doesn't allow this process to occur. Throughout geological history this was done under ground, hence the oil fields. If we're serious about carbon sequestration using plants, we have to cull and bury them, or turn them into something indigestible, and plant new trees to continue the process. Letting the forest stand indefinitely limits the amount of CO2 you can pull from the air, because existing trees can only get so big and once they are big they block new trees from receiving sunlight. In the end when these big trees die the carbon is recycled back into the air by microorganisms. Cutting and burying the trees extends the amount of time the carbon is sequestered and makes space for new tree growth. By looking at the age-growth curve of whatever species you plant you can determine the best time to chop and bury them. The downside is you will also end up burying the nutrients stored within the tree along with the carbon. That's my thoughts on sequestration.

It was predicted in the Mayan calendar. 2012 was like Zero Point and the beginning of a new time line. In 2012 the world had reached 7 billion, then started dropping. The population is lessening all by itself. It's the end of a cycle and the beginning of a new one at a higher level. I think there is a world census to be taken in 2020 and it will show there are less people, not more. Right now by my pendulum answers the population is in the very low 5 billion. Some time in 2020 it will go to 4 billion. The planet has been lessening 1 billion every four years. But I doubt that the powers that be will share the statistics. It would cause world panic. However, in 2024 there will be no way to conceal it.

I'm not sure why you can't understand the simple concept of the relationship between CO2 concentration and global temps. They go hand in hand, and the world was a lot hotter 14 million years ago and at all times the CO2 concentrations were high. And it is irrelevant to mention the what happened 500 million years ago because for 10,000 years before the industrial revolution CO2 levels stayed at around 280 ppm. Since the industrial revolution when fossil fuel started being burned it has increased to 415 ppm. Only 30 years ago it was at 350. Do you understand the difference between CO2 levels rising by 33% in only the last 100 years and not rising at all over the previous 10,000 years, and rising so quickly during a period that coincides with the beginning of the large scale burning of carbon and production of carbon dioxide by humans?  Try to educate yourself on the correct information instead of learning from fox news or right wing denier websites.

Animal ag also uses half of the worlds grain and 1/3rd of our fresh water and we're headed towards a water crisis by 2040. \n\nOn top of that there are health benefits to ditching meat and dairy. \n\nHarvard Law review: “Climate change. Ocean dead zones. Fisheries depletion. Species extinction. Deforestation. World hunger. Food safety. Heart disease. Obesity. Diabetes. The list goes on. There is one issue at the heart of all these global problems that is too often overlooked by private individuals and policy makers alike—our demand for and reliance on animal products.” http://harvardelr.com/2015/10/26/elrs-a-leading-cause-of-everything-one-industry-that-is-destroying-our-planet-and-our-ability-to-thrive-on-it/\n\nDon't forget that market consumerism has a great effect too. We don't have to wait for the government to tell us to eat sustainably, we can change our diets now. In this talk from Oxford researcher Joseph Poore he notes that the annual GHG mitigated between a meat eater and a Vegan is a co2 equivalent to 11 return flights from London to Rome. https://youtu.be/8miQs3mPGu8\n\nEating animal products is like fly tipping or emptying plastics into the ocean or dumping oil into soil - it's incredibly harmful to the environment but most do not understand how severe a plate of food can be.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jh5578", "channel": "UCcY6GczEv8jUOrDZVVtrkwA", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTLffZbB43DffsJtEe10COS_CZyHGX1jo8T3t1sAg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's also noteworthy  that average global temperature has dropped by almost half a degree Celsius since the Super El-Niño three years ago. And although global temperatures have been rising slowly for thirty years, the warming trend has noticeably been slowing rather than accelerating since the start of this century — in complete contrast to the predictions of almost all climate models. Only one-third to two-thirds of the predicted global warming has taken place in the last thirty years, even though more than half of all industrial carbon dioxide emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution have been released during that time.\r Contrary to all predictions, neither the number nor the intensity of drought, floods, forest fires or hurricanes has increased in the last thirty years. Even sea level rise is much more gradual and constant than predicted.

Electrical and magnetic currents are two of the causes that could do the job. So what could a passing planetary system do, especially with one of the planets being ten times the mass of earth, with a gravitational force that would cause mass upheaval to where it rises upon earth?\n\nThe answer is, it would create a pull in iron ore from within planet earth, due to its magnetic force. This would be shown to the world's citizens via; Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Volcanic activities around the earth, but especially in the region of our world where it rises the closest too, and that particular area at present is, Indonesia.\n1). Indonesia has had more than 150 earthquakes with a 7.0 magnitude in the period of 1901–2017, and this is much too many. \n2). Figures showed that in 2017: Volcanic Activity had been a relatively average year for the world's active volcanoes, the activity that did take place was spectacular. Out of an estimated 1,500 active volcanoes, 50 or so erupt every year, spewing steam, ash, toxic gases, and lava.\n3). Since the devastating tsunamis of 2004, the region of Indonesia has suffered numerous little ones, but another large one is surely not far off.\n\nThe planetary system that I am talking about is called Planet Nibiru and with it comes another seven smaller planets, earth and moon size ones. This occurance is estimated to happened every 3,600 years, and if they are all assembling as one mass, then the gravitational pull will be like nothing we would have witnessed since the times of Noah. And as of now, society then was very messed up too, due to the imbalance of neurons caused by huge magnetic activity. This would cause people not to think as normal as otherwise, and they will become short tempered and violent in some instances! \n\nPlus let's not forget, the magnetic North Pole is moving at a fare rate at present towards Siberia, and this could be the reason for various whale beachings and animals losing their directional paths, which they have followed for centuries! \n\nAt present we can not see this planetary system, due to the heavy chemtrailing of our skies, however if one is up in North West Alaska, then seeing them at certain times of the day is far greater, due to the lack of Chem-trails. When Noah was around he could clearly see this planetary system. He would of studied the moon cycles, and the rising of the seas, and would of been able to calculate that planetary mass could and would cause huge effects with changes in weather and earthquake tremors and volcanic activity.\n\nOn some occasions when Planet Nibiru passes, it may pass by without a major incident. But there will occasionally be, a catastrophe when it passes closer than it did previously.\n\nThis is my view of what I have read and learned from other sources. And I solemnly believe that this is the cause of climate change as we know it. Only last December 2018, Australia witnessed a record temperature on record in terms of mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures. The national mean temperature was 2.13 °C above average.\n\nThey are keeping all the above planetary information from us, because 'they' think we are too dumb to understand, what is really happening!! \n\nSo stay calm and look to the skies.... \n💜🙏💜", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Peter of The Awakened", "channel": "UCAiGmGVDcKTtJWxCxHJP7iw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRqMPhg1kjx2DVnYeTRlm3cdBmNUz24C_qOHhoeZ-Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxZofs0JAlDLctmaZV4AaABAg", "text": "Everyone has been fooled and both the American and British media have openly been told not to interview anyone who disputes that it is humans that have caused the climate to change. If the oil and gas had not been used, where would all the plastics have come from (which sadly, humans dump in land fill sites, rivers and the sea!)? Where have many of the oil based chemicals, tar, medicines, food additives etc. etc. come from? (See a partial list of 6,000 products made from oil at https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/partial-list-over-6000-products-made-from-one-barrel-oil-steve-pryor). ; How would we have produced the energy we have used? How would we have transported food and goods around the planet...by horse and cart and rowing boats? How would we have heated and cooled our homes? Well, we could have cut down ALL of the trees I suppose...It is bad enough that we have cut down most of the trees in most countries and in particular around the tropics where the tree cover historically controlled the world climate! Those living in or near or visiting rainforest will be aware how tropical rains are absorbed by the trees very quickly after a storm, since each tree can absorb its own weight in water. Evaporation in the rainforest helps to keep the temperature down, particularly in the tropics, whereas cleared land retains the radiant heat of the sun. Then look at the main real current proximate cause of climate change... THE POLE SHIFT! \n\n\nThe concept of 'global warming'. and 'global temperature increases', of a variety of alleged current and future ranges, is not of any scientific value. Global temperatures vary from year to year and from geographical location to location. Many of the temperature and climate recording stations were installed many years ago in relatively rural locations where over time, housing, industrial and road developments have increased localized temperatures and altered localized climate. The increased extreme weather now becoming common worldwide has also produced record high and low temperatures worldwide,  year on year. Last year (2018) a record low temperature of -83 C was recorded in Siberia and a record high temperature of 51.3 C was recorded in Algeria. With huge variations worldwide over short and long periods of time, proposing an average global temperature is completely illogical, unscientific and fictional. Temperature recording stations are not spread at equidistant locations in similar environments over every square mile of the Earth's surface which would be an absolute requirement if the data had any value at all. In addition, the use of historic data from air bubbles in ice containing CO2, has now been under scrutiny following the realisation that gases locked up in ice are absorbed at different rates in the ice and the remaining air and its constituents does not necessarily represent the air trapped at historic moments in time.\n\n\nTemperatures on the planet swung from -83oC to + 56oC last year. Seasonal and day/night time temperatures can swing 60oC on many land surfaces, so talking about an average temperature increase of 2o C as being catastrophic would make very little difference to many areas of the Earth. Far more serious is the surge in extreme climate change with the escalation of droughts, floods, unseasonal climatic changes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. These increasing extreme climate variations are also dramatically affecting the current world food output. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELA_VdMN6eY and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCtZ6SJlH7U ; and many others. The current escalation of these changes cannot under any circumstances be caused by the tiny increase in CO2. \n\n\nWhilst cyclical historic climatic patterns are a guide to future climate, so many factors and accurate data are missing from historic data and projected computer models. Our planet and its climate change is affected by its variable orbit around the sun, solar activity cycles, variations in earthquake and volcanic activity, pole shift, solar and cosmic radiation, impact from passing planetary debris, to name but a few of the causes. Seasonal cyclical climatic variations throughout the calendar year depend on location, the Sun's position during the day and night and the elliptical orbit and distance between the Earth and the Sun. The increase in the release of CO2 by man, has a minute affect on weather. The release of methane from livestock whose population numbers are similar to the human population are far more damaging than the CO2 man produces. In addition, we are led to believe the alleged heat trapped by the 1 in 2,500 molecules of CO2 in the atmosphere makes a bee line for the CO2 molecules and does not go anywhere near the 2,499 molecules of other atmospheric gases! Radiant heat from the Earth's surface does bounce around CO2 molecules, but ultimately it escapes. Comparing CO2 to the affect glass in a greenhouse has on retaining heat is ridiculous and unscientific! There is no glass window in the atmosphere or glass dome around the planet! What makes the concept that CO2 is a 'greenhouse gas' even more ridiculous is that CO2 is a main input for photosynthesis and not only are concentration levels of CO2 in greenhouses much lower, many owners of greenhouses have to inject more CO2 to increase plant growth! The reason greenhouses are warmer than the surrounding environment is because the glass prevents the escape of the trapped heat which is also a requirement for rapid plant growth. People in glass hoses should not blame the CO2! The Clouds have an infinitely greater ability to trap heat since cloud as we are all very aware, clouds help prevent frosts and prevents the sun from warming the Earth's surface! As many who fly will testify, the tops of clouds are white and not only prevent heat from the sun reaching the Earth's surface, but reflect heat back away from the Earth's surface.\n\n\nOf greater affect on the world climate is the destruction of forest, particularly around the tropics where lack of trees to absorb the sun's radiation causes tropical (not global) warming and the absorption of much more moisture from the tropical seas as a result of higher air and sea temperature. Global solar minimum records may have been a guide to  future climate from past records, however, the affects of the pole shift are altering global conditions and projections from historic records and cycles. At the last GSM, we were not experiencing the extreme temperatures and extreme weather events now being recorded! Also, we did not experience such a huge increase in earthquake and volcanic activity. (Sometimes as many as 4000 earthquakes over 2.5 on the Richter scale each month instead of 200, 16 years ago and over 70 erupting volcanoes each month as opposed to 3, 16 years ago.) Huge cracks and sink holes have also increased year by year in the last 16 years as a result of the stress on the crust from the current crustal slip.\n\n\nSo one cause for the escalation of extreme weather events is simple...less trees in the tropics each year....less to absorb the suns radiation = tropical warming (NOT GLOBAL WARMING!). Higher temperature around the tropics = more moisture evaporated from the oceans producing much warmer, denser and increased cloud production (hence more flooding in tropics where tree cover is reduced).....then more and denser ‘tropical rainforest clouds’ carrying more moisture, escape the tropics as intense heat on cleared land creates lift to allow these clouds to escape the tropics on trade winds...hence regional cooling effect away from the tropics as cloud cover increases and increased rain and snow fall away from the tropics, whilst extra cloud cover also traps the extra heat travelling up from the tropics. Less trees in the tropics each year = less biomass to sequester the CO2.  As the ocean warms, the warmer seas travel north to the Arctic and south to the Antarctic. As warmer air from the tropics travels north and south, air is warmer in the Arctic and in the Antarctic....simples!’ The warmer air and seas distorts the position of the jet stream pushing it north towards west Canada and north towards the UK but there is a counteractive force pushing the jet stream south at some geographical locations as a result of the increase in cloud cover escaping the Tropics, which cools some areas of the ocean through reduced radiation from the sun.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Terry Moore", "channel": "UC5Kidgpkk3WR33qYsCkF2mQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSaqcvPKvNom3lEZtZyt95iJP1ZTYY4E8AGOCpF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

How would we have transported food and goods around the planet...by horse and cart and rowing boats>>\r\n\nThe fact that oil and plastics have been good for humanity doesn't mean that climate change also must be good. It's not black or white. Things are not 100% good or 100% bad, grow up. \r\n\r\n<<Then look at the main real current proximate cause of climate change... THE POLE SHIFT!>>\r\n\nGeological records of previous magnetic pole reversals (actual reversals, not the wobbling that has been witnessed) have not found that they cause any significant effect on climate. \r\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-poleReversal.html\r\n\r\n<<With huge variations worldwide over short and long periods of time, proposing an average global temperature is completely illogical, unscientific and fictional.>> \r\n\nThis variation is precisely why the change is measured in anomalies, not absolute temperatures. With an anomaly the day to day and location to location variation is eliminated, all that matters is the change over time, which is much more subtle and for which the trend is easy to see (it is going up.) \r\n\r\n<<The current escalation of these changes cannot under any circumstances be caused by the tiny increase in CO2.>> \r\n\nWhy not? Why should we believe you, and not the majority of climatologists and, for that matter, probably 99% of so-called \"skeptics\" who also do not subscribe to your pole shift theory? \r\n\r\n<<Comparing CO2 to the affect glass in a greenhouse has on retaining heat is ridiculous and unscientific! There is no glass window in the atmosphere or glass dome around the planet!>>\r\n\nDo you really think this is how scientists think it works? \"Greenhouse\" is just a word, it has nothing to do with how it actually works. \rCO2 as a molecule creates a dipole moment when IR of certain wavelengths interacts with it. This has been known since the 19th century. \n\n<<many owners of greenhouses have to inject more CO2 to increase plant growth!>>\r\n\nCompletely irrelevant to its ability to absorb infrared radiation and be a greenhouse gas. \r\n\r\n<<..less trees in the tropics each year....less to absorb the suns radiation = tropical warming (NOT GLOBAL WARMING!)>>\r\n\nForests tend to be darker than the grasland that replaces them, so your local insolation effect is backwards.

Globally the 1930s were not even close to today. \n\nSome scientists warned of an ice age in the 70s -- assuming air pollution would not be controlled and keep getting worse and that this out offset the warming from increased CO2. Air pollution was controlled but CO2 was not. Still, even during this time there were 5-10 times more papers predicting warming than were predicting cooling. \n\nSnowfall events do not prove anything, unfortunately. Snow still happens even with a +1C world. Temperatures on average are still rising. \n\nWeather is chaotic and difficult to predict but overall trends are not. Chaoctic variations average out reliably over time. When you have a consistent forcing, like a greenhouse gas increase, you can predict warming on average over time even without knowing in depth what is happening with every cloud or gust of wind on every square foot of the planet. \n\nAs for why it is concerning, it is not so much 2019 that was ever predicted to be that severe. The concerning predictions are for 2050 and 2100. A 5C warming would change the planet as much as the change between today, and the ice age. An ice age is only about 5-6 C cooler and the world is completely different -- sea levels hundreds of feet lower, glaciers miles thick covering much of the continents, weather completely different. \n\nThis is the climate we are adapted to. It is the one we have laid our farmland, built our coastal cities and decided where we should and should not inhabit. A changing climate represents an enormous, unwelcome, unneeded additional challenge on a future already set to have many other challenges. It is an unstoppable game of chase we are forcing ourselves to play, chasing across political boarders (conflict), chasing new lands and abandoning old ones at the cost of trillions.

It's subjective. Some (a surprisingly high number) of people seem to think that if all life on Earth is not wiped out, then it's nothing at all to worry about. Others would say a single species of tree frog going extinct is a 'catastrophe' to be avoided at all costs. \n\nBased on what's observed and predicted I think it's pretty clear to most people it's at least a cause for serious concern. Of course a cost vs benefit trade off should be considered to the best of our ability.

Instead of saying \"oh it must not be true\" why not try understanding why scientists actually think it's true?\n\nBasically 400 ppm is more than sufficient for photons traveling through the entire height of the troposphere to interact with. It's not a guess or a crazy theory, you can literally see it and measure it. The greenhouse effect is dominated by water vapor, but there are wavelengths over which H2O is transparent to IR and CO2 is not. This is where CO2 makes the difference, and within these ranges (again, where no other gas has any effect) you can already see complete absorption. Just from your .04%\r\n\nAs concentration increases, the absorption efficiency increases as well. This means more solar energy persisting in the the troposphere, every second of every day, including at night.\n\nNow I'm sure you'll come back and say \"ok but prove the CATASTROPHE\" which is basically the same as asking to summarize decades worth of research and hundreds of thousands of pages which is just not possible.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "David", "channel": "UCagYdjcsPedDoLbC4wvyqcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR7-RlRuLikOnOnh37qLQJFVoTxeL-35ZJaO0Azvg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I think we are being asked to change in greater ways than media like The Economist can understand (or countenance, perhaps). Economic systems that reward the serving of life, not its destruction (war, deforestation, etc.), would shift the whole game very quickly. We have to recognise that all of our most hallowed science was built on excluding the human and the energy of life from the equation. This has brought great understanding in many areas, but now that the technology based on it has become so vast, we are faced with the reality of systems that have nothing whatsoever to do with the thriving and fulfilment of living beings, and no science (in the Western mainstream, which is so dominating the world at the moment) to help us understand why. From there we are trying to re-balance something that is huge, self-regulating, living and incomprehensible, when we don't even have a science that tells us what balance is or how to achieve it. I don't think we'll get far while powerful countries default to aggressively expressed self-interest, but currently, that's where the money is and so the market cheers it on.

Also the preferred charging time for EV owners, is in the peak hours after the work day = larger percentage German coal power, so in reality it will be more like 130g CO2/km for a Model 3, and you can get a 90-100g/km Diesel or gasoline car. So the advice to people, is keep your car, and spend an amount on renewable shares. I'm somewhat of a flunked engineer and power efficiency in different fields has always been my baby, and I cringe every time Danish politicians are fiddling with the numbers to claim X project is green, like the latest FB datacenter in Fyn.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Tore Lund", "channel": "UCeV6vI7N7dkqCozQzuUX6nQ", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRO04NGPVfhkrVfyE6ZXY86Hso6UA8wBEg1OFXB5w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The warmer the climate, the fastest is forest regrowth / regeneration. In subtropical areas, if you do not cut your grass, for example, tree species already start recolonizing, and grow in height at a rate of about 1 meter per year, so in about 5 years you have already a young natural forest established. That is why people use fire, to control this regrowth, that is even faster in tropical and equatorial areas. Of course, tools or machinery could better control the regrowth, but often people are poor and ignorant in these areas, so they use fire.

So, they are harvested after about 10 years. Then part of the carbon they stored during their lives return to the atmosphere. But during their lifetime they improve the soils, increase moisture and decrease temperatures, and this must be taken into consideration. Some people also complain that most planted species are not indigenous. This is because, like animals, there are only a few domesticated tree species, and these few species are often not indigenous from the region. In Brazil, for example, we plant Eucalyptus a lot, but it is native from Australia. But it is better to have a forest plantation than a pastureland, I can assure you.

I am a professional forester with 47 years experience in Massachusetts. I do very good, careful, long term forest management. But, here in this state, the alarmists are so freaked out that they now are saying we should never, never, never cut any trees. But, with 7 billion people who want wood products- and given that wood products have a lower carbon footprint that cement, steel, plastic, etc.--- how will future generations have homes to live in, furniture and paper products?  Build cement homes? Plastic furniture? When done right- forest mgt. can produce wood while retaining much of the forest as it is- by means of light cutting, leaving the healthiest trees of the species best suited for the site and which can thence grow fastest to sequester the most carbon. But no, explaining that to these forestry haters doesn't work- they insist on stopping all tree cutting- and that has a lot of good forestry people royally pissed off. They claim all forestry destroys the forests and much \"forestry\" is poorly done- but there is such a thing as good forestry- but they persist in trying to get the state government to lock up all the forests. Of course THEY live in nice wood homes with wood furniture and paper products but they won't allow future generations to do the same. And, few are vegetarains (which I am)- when I ask them if they'll do that to lower their carbon footprint- and they mostly love to fly in jets, etc., etc. So I consider them hypocrites who want to wipe out the forestry folks while not willing to do their part. A lot of ordinary skeptics see this kind of craziness and hypocrisy. But we all know the climate is a bit warmer and that CO2 is a greenhouse gas- we just don't see evidence that it's an existential threat to the planet.

I would argue that greenhouses use more resources, not less. The money, materials, labour, and pollution expended to make those greenhouses is definitely more than planting in an open field. \n\nI'm not aware of anyone growing corn, wheat, potatoes, or rice in greenhouses so I imagine that is not practical either. Remember that Dutch farmers are only able to get this process to work with the high value flowers, fruits, and vegetables? That's nice and all but most people get their calories from bread, rice and potatoes.\n\nYes less water is used per plant, but is fresh water that important a resource? Some places in the world do experience frequent droughts but surprise, surprise the parts of Earth where most food is grown don't have water problems. The Great Plains in North America, the European Plain, China, Argentina, and southern Brazil. While the places that do have a water problem usually wouldn't be helped by this technology. Proper desserts are too hot to grow anything. While underdeveloped nations like Ethiopia, which may experience droughts, don't have the human capital to operate this technology.\n\nI would think it better to help these nations develop to the level of the first world. Support popular movements and governments that want to fight corruption and that respect property rights. This would allow locals to grow their own businesses and improve the economy and standard if living. Then education and foreign investment can be viable and there would be the money and human capital for your greenhouses. In the short term this would mean more pollution and forests being chopped down. But that's how you develop economics, you need to break a few eggs. Only rich nations whose people aren't suffering can afford to care about climate change.\n\nOr we could keep treating other nations like orphaned children and pay their citizens pocket change to plant trees.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Hans 7", "channel": "UCt2q2kg0b71X248cvWdMikw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRJKu2If6MmG2ZSRuN6aPbM95UlP7YH1VuedA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Did you also know that CO2 is the air of life and that plants grow faster and in higher yeald with higher co2 levels. Take greenhouses for example co2 gets risen to 1200 parts per million, we are at around 400 PPM today and plants are actually thriving https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/06/30/life-on-earth-was-nearly-doomed-by-too-little-co2/.\nSo essentially 0 emissions will lower the co2 PPM count in the atmosphere resaulting in suffocating plant life and/or slowing growth desteoying ecosystems and habitats. 500 million years ago according to fossil evidence there was a global greening where co2 PPM levels were at 1000 PPM there was no ice caps but there was tropical plant life as far as alaska, also algae fossils at the bottom of the north pole. Also did you know that at the last ice age according to core samples from greenland the co2 levels were at 180 PPM almost killing all life on earth. That being said in resault of less greenhouse gasses cooling the planet we could potentially spark a new ice age. The more ice in the caps the more sunlight reflected away resaulting in the cooling of the planet further killing not only humans (human deaths are statistically higher in the cold then the heat) but plants as well. This along with the malankovich cycle is earths way of correcting global temperature. We are only helping plant life to thrive providing then with the air they need to breath and in turn they are providing us with the air we need to breath.\n\nBut are you too much of a biggot to do actual research on this topic arnt you.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Bruteforce Dj", "channel": "UC9UxEPgbqh-8c8Jr1TpeOSQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT9-cWEv9_DLczvB2Eg5HvPGvDPJTYRdVc-cBLs=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's amazing, how you don't even understand how grants for research are given yet will talk so confidently on them, you know the professor doesn't just pocket the money, whether they get a £10 grant or 1 million it hardly effects them. \"Useless degress\" go on what degree do you mean a geography degree is useless for anything other than climate this is getting more pathetic the more I look at it you don't even know what degree you are talking about yet will call it useless.

People like you help idiots like macr0n spread the lies.\n\nMaybe you guys need to come to Amazon to see by yourself instead buy the idiotic narrative of Europe. \n\nBrazil is a power of grains and if it get Europe market, it will put France down easily. Macr0n is totally scared of the new agreement of free trade between Brazil and Europe.
