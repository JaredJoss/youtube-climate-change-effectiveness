{"cid": "UgzHGvXw0YctyHmIEd14AaABAg", "text": "Climate change is only small not as they are putting it all over the media. The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly  up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

Difficult situation. I do hope that your situation improves. The past few months where I live it has been much colder than normal and extreme precipitation. It rains, snows, or hails constantly. We had a rather dry and hot summer this year but what tends to happen is that it gets balanced out with below average cold and excess moisture in the region during the fall and winter months. This is what seems to be happening. Weather has cycles. Some of it has to do with solar activity. There are lots of influences. But it concerns me when the so called climate science contradicts themself and it still gets passed off as science. Carbon taxes, and just the way governments exploit the topic is alarming. Climate Change appears to be mostly a political movement to tax and control economies and freedom of people globally. Yes carbon dioxide levels are slowly rising but this is not a concern nor is it a toxin. Plant life thrives on increases of CO2. Crops in my area continue to do better every year. We shouldn't be fearful of the air we exhale. I believe that the Climate Change/Crisis movement will go down as one of the biggest frauds ever. None of their predictions have come true.

That is an increase from 0.028 % of the atmosphere (280 ppm) over approx. 270 years, (1750 - 2020), so an actual increase of 130 ppm, or an extra 0.013% of the atmosphere. \n\n0.041 % ÷ 0.028 % = a 46 % increase in co2 levels. ( not to be confused with 46 % of the atmosphere ). Add to that, the widely accepted, well known fact that increasing co2 gives diminishing returns. So, for example, a doubling of co2, ( or a 100 % increase in co2 levels ), will only result in approx. 1*C temp rise. So, even at 560 ppm, (2× 280 ppm), or 0.056 % of the atmosphere, temps would rise only 1*C. We have seen an approx. 1.4*C increase, over that 270 years, indicating there are (many) other factors at play....

The simple fact is it's all part of a much larger, and much more complicated system, and to some degree or another, it is being renewed continually. But they claim this \"ancient\" ice is \"gone forever, never to return\"... and yet the polar ice caps are still there.  And they always fail to mention the vast majority of sea ice is under the water's surface, out of view, thus making the sea ice look significantly less than it actually is. I generally ignore any and all close up shots, seeing as they can easily be taken out of context... the same way they love to bog us down with minute details, and charts, and figures... usually all taken out of their much broader context, in order to confuse the unsuspecting viewer. It's all quite pathetic, in my humble opinion.\n\nI watched a video yesterday that first mentioned ice studies at the polar regions (plural), but then it focused only on the arctic ice cap shrinking, and conveniently failed to show the antarctic ice sheet, which was actually growing at the same time... very deceptive.\n\nYou raise an interesting question, though; one I had not considered.

{"cid": "UgwqWqd6tomeZjRhdAt4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Those people just have narrow mindsets and can't even understand the bigger picture of what is happening around the world. They feel threatened that the abolishment of fossil fuels would have a negative effect on their lives, when there are solutions to go around it, one of which is stated in the video, and the other examples can be seen from the Canadian carbon tax ($50 per tonne of co2, allowing money to be redistributed and channelled into projects that serve the public better), the  EU ETS (which ensures companies dont emit more co2 than their allocated quota, the fines imposed on non-compliant companies prevents other companies from emitting gases (besides co2, which is although stimulates breathing in humans, at high levels, can cause tachypnea (excessive breathing)) like nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons which affects public health), etc.  Climate deniers prefer to focus on the very tiny errata or flaws in climate change advocates and amplify them to defame them or to prove their point, ignoring the facts and prefer to immerse themselves in the beautiful little world full of factories and industries dumping co2 into the atmosphere and breathing in the freshness of the gaseous cocktail of co2, ch4, CFCs, etc. Apparently now, even your opinion on climate change is a definition of your political stance, and that is what happens when your president's party sells plastic straws for the sole reason of countering their rival liberals which were selling paper straws out of consideration for the climate. If you are a die-hard climate denier, then pls dont run for president, or any powerful role like minister or senator, letting imbeciles to run society is the equivalent of self-destruction. We are on track to dramatic reduction in carbon levels or on track to signing the death certificate of all future generations. Good luck, world! Hopefully, we would still exist in the near future!\n\nEDIT: I would like to add on that denying climate change is happening or denying humans as the root cause of it is not healthy skepticism and  but blatant ignorance of the facts. Yes, we should practise healthy skepticism when we see huge corpuses of data showing such frightening correlation between human activity and environmental degradation and climate change, we should ignore those data that is highly improbable, on both ends of the spectrum, then count how many of those datasets that make sense show support or oppose the correlation and that humans have a pivotal role in climate change. Climate deniers say data is cherrypicked, and that scientists profit from those media uproar on climate change, sadly, this claim, is once again nothing but irrational, as shown from https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-10-25/climate-change-sceptics-converted/9053406 which showed how some scientists who were once skeptics of climate change finally understood climate change is an existential issue, but still maintained a healthy level of skepticism on climate change\n\nEDIT: \"90% of all articles that deny climate change comes from right-wing politics.\"  and \"Those promoting denial commonly use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of a scientific controversy where there is none\"\nGo to --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial  (references section) \n\n\nEDIT: If you are that ^ 10%, then kindly send your views and opinions here, if you are that 90%, i shant bother about you.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Political Abstinence", "channel": "UCVfyR97nkIXxTweLg5-T-QA", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRY69HNKISSvczFrn7U5xRaQLycbqezGCFCCtv8=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We release over 8-9 gigatons per year, rising.Yes, excess amounts of co2 in the atmosphere are harmful, because they drive the temperature up, a process that is well understood, documenmted and proven.\nWhat is also known is that, in the entire history of the earth, global temperature and co2 levels have always been related. When it was really hot on earth, co2 levels were really high and vice versa.\nWhat is also known is that in the past 600000 years, there were several cold and hot periods, where temperatures shifted several degrees (parallel to co2 levels).\nOne such cycle from hot to cold lasted approximately 100000 years each time.\n\nNow, we raised temperature by one degree in just 30-40 years. Scientists say our earth is warming 10-20 times faster than at any other point in time of earths history.\nAll of the things I just said are well documented and have been for years.

I am frustrated with many of the reports that the climate scientists base their findings on.  A lot of the data in their own reports, especially when you look at their on citations of data presented, are skewed by either cherry picking, narrowing sample periods, or failing to highlight margins of error.  An easy example of this are ground temps measured over time in areas that were rural and are now urban.  This is a skew of data, as the variables surround the thermal measuring instrument have changed and should be removed from the overall average.  A thermometer on grass is cooler than one on pavement on the same data, within the same mile.  When you start to dig deep into the data, you realize it his heavily flawed and is a very poor (if not false) statistical model.  This is why there is now this uprising.  For the record, I'm totally against pollution, especially industrial farming (especially salmon farming) and plastic.  But I cannot drink the cool aid on man's influence on global climate.

What you stated in your comment is not how scientists arrived at the consensus on global warming. No, you don't just put a thermometer at one location and observe its fluctuations over decades. Evidence from the gases trapped in ancient glaciers and ice showed that the usual carbon dioxide levels used to be only slightly above half of what it is now, 200 - 250 ppm, also you monitor the temperatures from a large variety of locations across the world, to obtain the general rising trend of temperatures.

So what about the rest of the plant? (Summary of water cycle) Transpiration through the stomata of the leaves of plants cools it down a lot due to water's insanely high latent heat of vaporisation, which transfers loads of heat from plants to the atmosphere. The water vapor then reaches saturation point high up in the troposphere causing condensation which results in the formation of clouds and the vast amounts of energy lost to the surroundings during this stage causes negligible changes in temperature due to the sparseness of air near the tropopause. The radiation, however is released into space as water droplets have very very low transmissivity, so very low amounts of EM waves permeate through. Due to the fact that plants generally have very very high amounts of water (90-95% from https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/h2o5.htm ), and since it has extremely high specific heat capacity of 4180J/Kkg, it requires a huge amount of heat to heat it up. Water has high absorptance, yet the vast majority of radiation only results in negligible temperature increases and microwave radiation, despite being one of the best frequency to heat water, requires a huge amount of energy flux density, of up to 0.1 - 0.2 W/cm^2 for significant heat gain over a reasonable amount of time.

And it is volatile so it breaks down and doesn't accumulate. There is around 2 one millionths of methane in the atmosphere and most of that is naturally occurring. So if we exaggerated and said man caused half, that would be one part per million. Picture a pail with 1,000 marbles in it. Picture one thousand pails with one thousand marbles in each of them. Now take just one warm marble and add it to just one pail. Explain to me now how we just catastrophically overheated all one thousand pails containing a total of one million marbles. Saying that methane is a dangerous greenhouse gas is absolutely laughable and stupid. And CO2 is similar. Man has added only one twenty five thousandth in CO2 to the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. See, they never tell you this. They mislead you to think it's a huge ratio, like 40% or something. Then they lie to you and say there is a consensus. That's bullshit. Less than 200 people made up that 97% claim.

This freezing stops those processes, and it takes millions of years for naturally-emitted volcanic CO2 to top up the atmosphere until it becomes hot enough to melt the Snowball Earth.\nThe Earth has a Milankovitch Cycle which cyclically varies its insolation by the Sun, and interferes with its Snowball Cycle, producing greater and lesser ice ages as a consequence.\nThe Sun is stable and constant, for the purposes of this discussion.  Its output has very small cyclic variations to an almost-level slope of a very slowly rising output which will climax 4,500,000,000 years from now.\nEven so, scientific papers have been produced since the sixties which show that the next Ice Age would have appeared at around 17,000 years in the future, not accounting for the atmospheric carbon dumped into the atmosphere by Man since the start of the Industrial Revolution.\nVenus is warmer than it would otherwise be because of its massive CO2 atmosphere and also its massive sulphuric acid clouds.\nIf you would like to confirm this you need only read Hansen's publications where you can confirm his calculations.

Our orbit around the sun is not circular but varies from circular to elliptical, so our distance from the sun is not the same when we are in an elliptical orbit. \r\n\r\nMaunder minimum (Lack of sunspots) is considered to have caused the Little Ice Age which lasted from the 1300’s to around 1850.  This points to the sun not being constant in the amount of energy produced by the sun.  How much of the warming of the planet after 1850 was due to sunspot activity and how much was due to increasing CO2 and water vapor? \r\n\r\nWater vapor is a green house gas and makes up around 4% of the atmosphere.  CO2 is referred to as a trace element in the atmosphere because it makes up just 4/10’s of one percent of the atmosphere. You conclude the only reason for the planet warming is due to CO2 and methane.  \r\n\r\nA few years back (2016) scientist had predicted the suns next 11-year solar cycle would start a cooling period.

More than 1/4 of its electrical production comes from renewable enrgy with 20% from hydro, 2% from nuclear, 5% from solar, but remember, it produces 6.412 TWh of electricity in 2017, and US produces around 4TWh of electricity in 2017. So despite US having 1/3 of electricity produced by renewables and the rest by non-renewables, China produces 20% more electricity from renewables. US produces around 14.7% (total co2%) while China emits 27.2%. It was said in https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/09/19/are-dictatorships-better-than-democracies-at-fighting-climate-change that \"Global warming cannot be kept below 1.5 °C unless coal use in China falls sharply\" and indeed, the coal use in China fell sharply from 80% of total electricity generation in early 2010s to 60% in 2017. One has to take note of the rapid urban development in china and that is the main driver of its co2 emissions. In the 2019 UN climate summit, the Chinese envoy said that China aims to peak its CO2 emissions by 2030, and this site, https://www.wri.org/resources/charts-graphs/capita-co2-emissions-current-and-projected showed that US would decrease its CO2 emission by not more than 1 tonne per capita while china would double its 2007 co2 per capita levels to around 10. But US still emits twice the amount of China (I know u would be talking abt how many ppl work as farmers or in the primary sector etc etc but just saying, the west accounts for 40.8% of the world's co2 emissions and that is only 32 countries (the EU, US, canada, australia and turkey)\nSecondly, I stated in my comment to give sources to BACK UP your points which can be either pro or opp. Do you understand what is the meaning of \"sources\" in the first place? Sources means sites like scholarly articles and articles that are responsible for the original content. WIkipedia and google are responsible not for manipulating the information but show those that are more popular due to consumer preferences.

Experience is not an accurate way of describing things since if you put two people in the same room for one day they would have different experiences, as it is subject to opinions. I'm going to address all of the things u stated in your first reply.1) There was no \"ice age in the 70s\", as we are IN an ice age that started 39mya already. Rather, it was as stated in http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/11584/1/2008bams2370%252E1.pdf, \"Global cooling was a conjecture\",  \"especially during the 1970s, of imminent cooling of the Earth culminating in a period of extensive glaciation. Some press reports in the 1970s speculated about continued cooling; these did not accurately reflect the scientific literature of the time, which was generally more concerned with warming from an enhanced greenhouse effect.\"\nSecondly, Fun fact #1: ozone is a greenhouse gas. The ozone hole that was discovered in 1985 due to CFCs in Antarctica actually \"not only reduced heat trapped over the region, it helped stir circumpolar winds, which in turn created sea spray that formed reflective, cooling clouds.\" from https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/5/100505-science-environment-ozone-hole-25-years/ so it caused an increased rate of warming in antarctica. \nFun fact #2: UV rays are obviously carcinogenic. So technically letting an ozone hole expand and cover the entire world isnt a particularly good idea and the Montreal protocol at least prevented that environmental catastrophe where a ton of incident UV radiation hits Earth rather than being reflected off by the ozone layer. \nI had expected u to go off ranting and scoffing about the peculiarities in my reply, rather than, address the points , and u just decided to go off the tangent and sidetrack because u failed to understand or did not want to address the main points i was trying to convey, which can be easily found on the first few sentences of each paragraph.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Political Abstinence", "channel": "UCVfyR97nkIXxTweLg5-T-QA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRY69HNKISSvczFrn7U5xRaQLycbqezGCFCCtv8=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So the co2 we produce is accumulating and at an increasing rate. Co2 has been demonstrated to be able to trap heat, and without it, the average temp of earth would have been around 250-260K which is around -9.5 to 8 Fahrenheit.

But if the climate changes too quickly, it could lead to major disasters. One example that’s far more extreme than even what we’ve been dealing with so far probably happened 66 million years ago, according to an article by National Geographic. A lot of people accept the possibility that the dinosaurs were killed by one of the many rocks floating in space, but most fictional depictions I’ve seen show the impact, as if that’s what killed all the dinosaurs and somehow left the smaller animals untouched. In reality, if it really was a meteor impact, it was probably all of the ash and debris filling the sky and blocking out the sun that killed the big planets, starving the big herbivores, and indirectly starving the big carnivores. That ended once the ash settled, so the small creatures feasting on the corpses of giants survived and evolved into the animals we know today. All of that happened over the course of tens of millions of years, so to say that the Earth was hotter hundreds of millions of years ago doesn’t say much.\n\n\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/dinosaur-extinction/", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Darth Bane", "channel": "UC0iO4fBLWM-oU3zT34SWk2w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR5r8QvFplw2UlZQssRce_Jp0L4-mt0DJnyKlye=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They love stating the % concentration of CO2 as a strawman and then argue how can a small number be so bad? But it's a meaningless ratio where you divide a non precipitous GHG by the sum of O2, Nitrogen, and a little bit of Argon, none of which are GHG's. You may just as well divide by the number of stars in the sky or grains of sand at the beach. It's pointless, but they love the number. Comparing CO2 concentration to H20 is also a red herring because H20 is precipitous, it reaches a saturation point and then falls as rain. CO2 is only removed by organic processes, dissolving in sea water (leading to acidification of the surface skin), and chemically through the weathering of rocks. An average ICE car that gets 20 miles per gallon of gas produces about 1 lb of CO2 per year, drive it 12,000 miles per year and you just put 6 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, some of which will remain for hundreds of thousands of years (the chart has a very long flat tail, after the biosphere sinks and ocean sinks stabilize the remainder is consumed from weathering rocks, which takes a looooong time). H20 is an important GHG, but the relationship between CO2 and H20 is best described as CO2 as being the volume control, the more CO2 the warmer the air gets & the more moisture it can hold so the warmer it gets.

They also took note of wind direction at time of readings. Now if you map the locations of weather stations (and their relocations and other structures including hills etc with wind) and map the encroachment of Urban life around it over time. For example a bird nest attached to a weather station can effect the humidity and Temperature readings giving an offset in error. When occupied the heat rises and when teh reader go to the box the bird flies away. The heat is still been given off while the reader is reading. Also the humidity can be effected as it is evaporating from the bird nest, especially when it is been built. Also the Reader can effect very fine measurement reading by their very presence. Breading down or near the sensor can effect fine tune humidity readers. The heat from the body can cause the temperature reading to rise slightly. Care must be taken by the reader to be down wind of the instruments when taking reading, as a human being is a thermal island and a humidity island.\n\nWhen you map the development/Economic status over time, you will noticed the rapid development in the 1960's onwards that corresponds with the rising heat. The 1980s drop in heat production with the economic depression. Same with the cooling with the latest great economic recession caused by government bail outs by taxing the people and cuts in spending stopping people from generating heat. Also Look at population growth in line with Thermal heat expenditure and the reduction of family size as people moved into a nuclear family homes and then the next stage, the separation of families (divorce) with Thermal expenditure.  If poor people had more money they burnt more fuel giving off heat. Poor people were often suffered from fuel poverty during economic recession/depressions, hence the lowering of temperature. Now map both together.

{"cid": "Ugz1hCUtO8WaFkaFE_l4AaABAg", "text": "In Thomas Jefferson’s book, Note on the State of Virginia, he argued for the United States to be founded on an agrarian ideology. In the excerpt we read for class today, Jefferson called for an American economy built on agriculture and to “let the work-shops” remain in Europe”. He recognized the need for some domestic industry but believed the vast land of America could be utilized by farming. Alexander Hamilton’s views contradicted Jefferson’s and his views on manufacturing and industry prevailed; consequently, America has progressed into a state of manufacturing rather than an agrarian state. This trend has become increasingly evident over time. Today, less than 2% of Americans farm. “Even though everyone still eats, taking part in the practice of growing food has less direct influence on people’s lives than at any point in our history (Hagenstein et al 3). Thus, we see the prevailing view of Alexander Hamilton as having profound impacts on the American economy and the global environment.\n\nThomas Jefferson adamantly advocated for the founding of this country to be based on agrarian ideals. Agrarianism supports working on land in ways that can last due to its focus on the interconnectedness of life (Freyfogle xix). Agrarians are sustainable and understand that humans need the Earth, land, and animals for our very subsistence. In the agrarian mindset, the health of humans is dependent in the long run on the well being of the larger land community (Freyfogle xix). Clearly, agrarian views dissent greatly from the views of the majority of modern people, especially those living in urban or suburban settings in the United States. Agrarians “believe that those who buy products are implicated morally in their production, just as those who discard waste items are morally involved in their final end… Producers and sellers, too, are morally responsible for their work, and in ways the market cannot absolve or cleanse when their products are sold”. Of course, one cannot live in a place without altering it, however, agrarians are about harmonizing their relationship and effect on nature, not exploiting it. From these readings, I came to be constantly asking myself the same question, “If Thomas Jefferson’s agrarian ideology prevailed, would we still be in the current state of environmental degradation we are currently in?", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Rey Alicea", "channel": "UC03hToU5v2hGFevHWrrBESw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFjFLerxaTvVYF1zAUuGQdLOk36L-rP1YNNl3KadQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

When I have looked at the correlation between C02 and temperature,  there have been times when C02 has been 4500 ppm and there has been an ice age. There have been periods where C02 has been racing upwards and temperatures has been dropping. You say we and life on Earth, can’t adapt to the level of C02 been pumped out by us. But all plant life evolved when C02 levels were 3 to 5 times higher than today. Halls filled with large numbers of people often have levels as high as 1200ppm.

It periodically releases this pent up energy over time then returns to a more normal state. This causes both short term and long term changes in the amount of energy given off by the sun. To monitor solar radiation we put a satellite into orbit between Earth and the Sun called SOHO  You can look up information about SOHO here https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov\nBecause we monitor solar output constantly we know for certain that modern warming is not caused by the sun. While solar output has been declining recently, the temperature has continued to rise. However the sun is responsible for some warming trends in the past.\n\nThe Earth is pulled in its orbit by the other planets. They tug on it over time and slightly change its orbit. The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle but an ellipse. This change in Earth's orbit causes energy from the sun to hit the planet in different ways over time. This change in how the Earth orbits the sun causes long term changes in Earth's climate. This is called the Millankovitch Cycle. You can read about MIlankovitch Cycles here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles\nWhen the sun heats up the oceans the oceans release carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide causes a feedback loop where the temperature rises even higher than the Milankovitch Cycle would have alone. Most changes in the climate prior to humans were caused by either changes in solar radiation and the Milankovitch Cycle. Milankovitch Cycles are over long time periods of 22,000 to 400,000 years. We know for certain that the Milankovitch Cycle is not responsible for modern warming. It does not make abrupt changes in climate we have seen in the last 100 years. However Milankovitch Cyles are primarily responsible for changes in the climate in the past.\n\nIn addition the ocean is currently absorbing Carbon Dioxide despite the fact that it's warming. You can read about the ocean absorbing Carbon Dioxide here http://pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification\nThis has never happened in the entire Quaternary.

We know there have been far more extreme shifts in the climate.. and in some cases weather alone is being put forward as proof... a rainy winter proves nothing at all regarding man made climate change, neither does the fact ice taken from the n. pole placed in Paris melts! when you see gimmicks like that, you, we, I should be suspicious, and when you have someone of the status of Al; Gore pushing a lie, you should consider that whole area a lie till proven otherwise... nothing that is said to back up man made climate change, when investigated, is true or presented in an honest way!\n\nThis is such a blatant lie, which is why it gets believed, if it were a mild lie... your would not be able to call people who questioned it, morons and attack their character.

Production of fresh water in volumes of tens of cubic kilometers per year. I use water production in large rivers. Working person. Work is moderately expensive, up to 60% of the total cost of the program. As an example I give the production of fresh water in the Nile River, and benefits from the event.\nSecond. Watering in dry and wastelands. No problem. Water is supplied to the arid areas of the rivers, streams, or sleeves, or in the newly built channels. Working person. Work is moderately expensive, up to 20% of the cost of the program.\nThird. Gross planting and growth of green matter: grass, shrubs and trees. Working person. Work is moderately expensive, up to 20%.\nJob natural technologies.\nGrass covers the soil. Locked soil reduces emissions of warm or hot air, and reduces its heating. And de facto become permanent now cooling the atmosphere. Example. Bare and in the summer the soil is heated from 40 to 60-70 degrees in the desert. The ground, covered with grass - about 20 degrees. Averaged emissions of hot air into the atmosphere is reduced to 2-3 times, or 200-300%. Nature Works. Free.\nThe destruction of carbon dioxide. Statistics:\n\"One hectare of forest adult consumes annually up to 6.5 tons of carbon dioxide and emits 5 tons of oxygen.\" 1,000 hectares will be removed from the atmosphere by 6500 tons of carbon dioxide, a million - 6.5 six million, and so on, and so every year. Ready technology for the destruction of atmospheric carbon dioxide and eliminate warming. Powered by nature.

Free.\nThe waters of the oceans gradually cooled, resulting in a gain of ocean plankton. Nature Works. Free.\nHence, the conditions under which the ocean removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are made and it will be displayed from the atmosphere and will eventually withdrawn. And as a confirmation of what has been said to give two quotations: \"Ocean during heating increases the emissions of carbon dioxide, and when cooled - removes it from the atmosphere.\" And another quote: \"The ocean plankton withdraws from the air three times, four times more carbon dioxide than all the world's forests.\" Nature Works.

Hansen.\nУстранение потепления за счёт использования природных технологий: \nЗа счёт производства пресной воды. – \nОбводнения засушливых и бросовых территорий. – \nВалового прироста зелёной массы: травы, кустарников и деревьев. – \nИ главное, за счёт восстановления и прироста океанского планктона. \nИспользуемые технологии:\nПервое. Производство пресной воды в объёмах десятков куб км в год. Я использую производство воды в крупных реках. Работает Человек. Работа умеренно затратная, до 60% общей стоимости программы. Как пример даю производство пресной воды в реке Нил, и выгоды от этого мероприятия.\nВторое. Обводнение засушливых и бросовых земель. Никаких проблем. Вода подаётся на засушливые территории по рекам, рукавам или ручьям, или во вновь построенным каналам. Работает Человек. Работа умеренно затратная, до 20% стоимости программы. \nТретье. Валовая высадка и прирост зелёной массы: травы, кустарников и деревьев. Работает Человек. Работа умеренно затратная, до 20%. \nРабота природных технологий. \nТрава закрывает почву. Закрытая почва уменьшает выбросы в атмосферу тёплого или горячего воздуха, и уменьшает её нагрев. И де-факто становится постоянно действующим предприятием по охлаждению атмосферы. Пример. Оголённая почва летом нагревается от 40 до 60-70 градусов в пустынях. Почва, закрытая травой – порядка 20 градусов. Усреднённые выбросы в атмосферу горячего воздуха в атмосферу снижаются до 2-3 раз, или на 200-300%. Работает Природа. Бесплатно.\nПо уничтожению углекислого газа. Статистика:\n«Один гектар взрослого леса уничтожает ежегодно до 6,5 тонн углекислого газа и выделяет 5 тонн кислорода». 1000 га уберут из атмосферы 6,5 тысяч тонн углекислоты, миллион – 6,5 шесть миллионов, и так далее, и так каждый год. Готовая технология по уничтожению из атмосферы углекислого газа и устранения потепления. Работает природа. Бесплатно.\nЕщё. «Один гектар зеленых насаждений поглощает 60 тонн пыли и очищает от вредных примесей 18 миллионов кубометров воздуха». Это на 70% готовые очистные сооружения! Все лёгкие соединения уберёт Природа, человеку останется убрать тяжёлые. Работает природа. Бесплатно.\nЕщё. «Производит порядка 2 тонн фитонцидов – эфирных масел, смол, ароматических веществ, бальзама и прочих мало исследованных лечебных эфирных соединений». Это природная Фабрика Здоровья для Человека, и особенно воспроизводящей части сообщества – Женщин и Детей». Работает природа. Бесплатно.\nНазванные выше технологии охлаждают ручьи, рукава и реки. Работает Природа. Бесплатно. \nОхлаждённые и осветлённые реки несут свои воды в моря и океаны. Работает Природа. Бесплатно. \nВоды Мирового океана постепенно охлаждаются, что приводит к приросту океанского планктона. Работает Природа. Бесплатно.\nОтсюда, условия, при которых океан изымает углекислоту из атмосферы выполнены, и она из атмосферы будет выводиться и будет в конечном счёте выведена. И как подтверждение сказанного даю две цитаты: «Океан при нагревании увеличивает выбросы в атмосферу углекислого газа, а при охлаждении – изымает его из атмосферы». И ещё цитата: «Океанский планктон изымает из атмосферы втрое-вчетверо больше углекислоты, чем все леса планеты». Работает Природа.

It wasn't that long ago that people thought flight and space travel were impossible but the science and technology advanced and we got to where we are now. The point isn't necessarily what you're trying to make it out to be. Yes science along with many things can have discrepancies but that doesn't negate the overwhelming majority truth of the facts. The point is the poorest/least well off of us in the world will be the first to feel and suffer the worst impacts... so whether or not your grandkids are smart or ignorant their skills of shooting, fishing, or whatever survival intelligence you believe will hold up against extreme natural disasters or drastic changes to the environment (which you clearly seem to enjoy) in the future are irrelevant and fall under a false sense of security because it will be hard to fish in a sea that is so warm the acidity level has killed the fish and it breeds the all too familiar flesh eating bacteria that has already become more and more of an issue/danger in many American fishing areas and killed quite a few fisherman already. Not to mention declining vegetation will throw off the natural balance of animals so that will ultimately become an issue for hunting if that is your fall back...so not quite sure how their survival intelligence helps there. Not only that but natural disasters of flooding and drought; pollution; dangerous bacteria; diseases; etc. these are all things that impact people equally whether they are intelligent or not. So if we know we can do things that are better for us all (even if you don't believe in climate change) in a less polluting/cleaner and more eco friendly way why not take that route instead of refusing to progress? If we had thought that way we wouldn't have airplanes, vaccines/medicines, automobiles, computers, boats, and even guns or the advanced and better quality of weapons that we all have the luxury of enjoying in our country. We all are responsible for our actions in life and the impact we have left behind will be our legacy.

The pressure has nothing to do with the heat on the planet. The pressure is only influenced by how much atmosphere the planet has. Therefore Venus has a large atmosphere. Also, only greenhouse gases trap heat on a planet. CO2 and water vapor are greenhouse gasses. Guess which we're putting into the air and which we already have an abundance of? \n\nIf the CO2 heats up the planet further our oceans will vaporize and then we will become like Venus.

They don’t necessarily link NASA with climate research and observations. But Earth is a planet too, and NASA is one of the biggest players in the Earth science arena, with broad expertise on observing our climate, especially from the vantage point of space. Today it spends over a billion dollars a year doing Earth science and has more than a dozen satellites in orbit around the planet watching the oceans, land, ice, atmosphere and biosphere.\nIn the 1970s, NASA’s planetary exploration budget fell dramatically. It was then that the agency really got into the business of studying our home planet from orbit. It was also a time when people were beginning to realize that our climate could change relatively fast, on the scale of the human lifespan. Today, we know that our climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and that humans are a key part of that change. NASA continues to launch new satellite missions, and is also relying on aircraft (manned and unmanned), as well as scientists on the ground, to take vital measurements of things like snowpack and hurricanes, augmenting the big-picture view we get from space.\n\nNASA’s role is to make observations of our climate that can be used by the public, policymakers and to support strategic decisions. Its job is to do rigorous science. However, the agency does not promote particular climate policies.\"", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Brazen Aden", "channel": "UCUxKVjEeAcn0RRnYvTqgpGA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZnCZhLcGcMIixIkVE_ls4OyU8Ew8LNFFNvYTMkQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is essential for life on Earth and is one of Earth's natural processes. It is the result of heat absorption by certain gases in the atmosphere (called greenhouse gases because they effectively 'trap' heat in the lower atmosphere) and re-radiation downward of some of that heat. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, followed by carbon dioxide and other trace gases. Without a natural greenhouse effect, the temperature of the Earth would be about zero degrees F (-18°C) instead of its present 57°F (14°C). So, the concern is not with the fact that we have a greenhouse effect, but whether human activities are leading to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect by the emission of greenhouse gases through fossil fuel combustion and deforestation.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/global-warming.php\n\n\"Global surface temperatures have increased about 0.74°C (plus or minus 0.18°C) since the late–19th century, and the linear trend for the past 50 years of 0.13°C (plus or minus 0.03°C) per decade is nearly twice that for the past 100 years.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/global-warming.php\n\n\"According to the range of possible forcing scenarios, and taking into account uncertainty in climate model performance, the IPCC projects a best estimate of global temperature increase of 1.8 - 4.0°C with a possible range of 1.1 - 6.4°C by 2100, depending on which emissions scenario is used. However, this global average will integrate widely varying regional responses, such as the likelihood that land areas will warm much faster than ocean temperatures, particularly those land areas in northern high latitudes (and mostly in the cold season). Additionally, it is very likely that heat waves and other hot extremes will increase.\"", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Brazen Aden", "channel": "UCUxKVjEeAcn0RRnYvTqgpGA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZnCZhLcGcMIixIkVE_ls4OyU8Ew8LNFFNvYTMkQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Carbon dioxide is of greatest concern because its rate of increase is exerting a larger overall warming influence than all of those other gases combined, and because carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will remain elevated for centuries unless we implement a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere effectively and economically. Most carbon dioxide from human activities is released from burning coal and other fossil fuels.

These are gases which allow direct sunlight (relative shortwave energy) to reach the Earth's surface unimpeded. As the shortwave energy (that in the visible and ultraviolet portion of the spectra) heats the surface, longer-wave (infrared) energy (heat) is reradiated to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases absorb this energy, thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space, and 'trapping' it in the lower atmosphere. Many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide, while others are synthetic. Those that are man-made include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), as well as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Atmospheric concentrations of both the natural and man-made gases have been rising over the last few centuries due to the industrial revolution. As the global population has increased and our reliance on fossil fuels (such as coal, oil and natural gas) has been firmly solidified, so emissions of these gases have risen. While gases such as carbon dioxide occur naturally in the atmosphere, through our interference with the carbon cycle (through burning forest lands, or mining and burning coal), we artificially move carbon from solid storage to its gaseous state, thereby increasing atmospheric concentrations.\"", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Brazen Aden", "channel": "UCUxKVjEeAcn0RRnYvTqgpGA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZnCZhLcGcMIixIkVE_ls4OyU8Ew8LNFFNvYTMkQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You paid a fortune to sit ina a classroom for years, only to be fed a diet of bullshit that you now consider to be on a par with Religion.\n\nSo lets put you back to bed.\n\nMars and Venus have the same concentrations of Co2.\n\nBoth planets have atmospheric CO2 concentrations around 95%. Earth’s atmosphere has only 0.04% CO2. The density of CO2 in both planet’s atmospheres is much higher than Earth’s atmosphere.\n \nTemperatures on Venus average a balmy 467°C, but temperatures on Mars average a nippy −63 °C. Why the big difference?\n \n\nAccording to the “runaway CO2 greenhouse” theory, both planets should be really hot. Mars is twice as far away from the Sun, so its top of atmosphere receives only 25% of the solar radiation as Venus. But clouds on Venus reflect 75% of the sunlight – so the SW radiation flux at the surface is similar on the two planets.\n \nSo why is Venus hot and Mars cold? Simple – it is the atmospheric pressure.\n \nThe pressure on Venus is nearly one thousand times higher than on Mars. As the atmosphere convects, descending gases warm and ascending gases cool. The amount of warming is determined primarily by the increase in pressure.\n \nEver used a bicycle pump? Why does it get hot?\n \nAnswer : Because you are doing work to the gas when you compress it. Similarly, solar radiation transfers energy to the atmosphere, causing convection and heating of sinking air. If there was no Sun, the atmosphere would be very cold and would in fact freeze.\n \nThe runaway greenhouse theory makes little sense. If it were true, the Earth would experience it from water vapour, not CO2. H2O is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, is much more abundant than CO2 and gets released from the oceans very easily and often – particularly as the planet heats up.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "laurejon", "channel": "UC56pIBoI2RCtWTCiAEF61ww", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQGgPGDhPYIGZTa0wuiMa8i5zziHjzQtCUqakSlqg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
