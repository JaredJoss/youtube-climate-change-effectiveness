Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ‚Ä≥eco- refugees,‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N.

I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major taking one side or  the other.  \n\nWhat I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn't support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is supportive, while anything  post that would support the argument stays.  Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...\n\nFrom NASA:¬† Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the¬†ice age¬†would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional ‚Äúblips‚Äù every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth's orbit‚Äîeccentricity, obliquity, and¬†‚Äîaffect global climate. But it's a lot more complicated than that.  \n\nAnd, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn't do so well because it's hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis.  Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100's of millions of years.\n\nSo, I totally believe in climate change... It's been going on for 100's of millions of years, since planet formation.¬† Long before humans arrived;  and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.\n\n\n\nAnd, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. \n\nI'll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.\n\nIt's pretty easy to get the impression that the narrative is being used as a political tool to try and get vast groups of people behind yet another 'crisis', then steer them to support a politician who puts himself up as a though-leader on the subject.

{"cid": "Ugwvhdjn3ZjL49QjJFB4AaABAg", "text": "IMHO climate change movement is political, taxing carbon is nothing more than kleptocracy. Driving down atmospheric carbon dioxide is damaging to life. Why? Because lowering carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere slows growth and even kills flora and fauna growth. Both mars and Venus have very high CO2 concentrations in their atmospheres whereas in between these two planets there is earth with only 0.04%. That low carbon dioxide concentration is due to flora that converts carbon dioxide to oxygen and ties up carbon via photosynthesis. So flora optimises the climate to suit life very effectively, far more effectively than humans can. Supporting plant life is philanthropic and is the way to go.  \n\nCarbon tax is lethal for the populations of poor countries and it is thus a bad idea. The more expensive green energy leaves less money for food. Lower carbon dioxide levels reduce crop yields resulting in more deaths. On the other hand photosynthesis is endothermic. It reduces the ambient temperature when the sun shines and the is carbon dioxide in the air - the more carbon dioxide the faster plants metabolise it. Carbon dioxide is essential for life, the more the better up to 4000 ppm (0.4%). \n\nFortunately the USA rejects the Paris accord and is doing the right thing - feeding and supporting flora, growing more trees.\n\n‚ÄúGlobal warming is real but natural rather than anthropogenic‚Äù, Dr Robert Zubrin\n\nFlora and fauna have successfully controlled earth‚Äôs climate for 3 billion years. So why not assist plants and animals as follows. \n\nBuild plant factories to feed 7 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nExamples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\nUse the land with cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\nUse goats to manage woody forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\nUse agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\nUse marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\nUse minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon‚Äôt be misanthropic.

The sun warms the land masses which warms the air as the polar ice melts. Eventually water completely covers the Earth causing the suns warm rays to reflect like a mirror cooling the planet until a global layer of ice forms. But luckily with the ever moving land masses the volcanos will eventually start up again and gasses plume through the ice cracks filling the air with dark brown smoke that the suns rays can warm up and melt the ice...exposing land masses (except at the polar caps) and warming starts once again.

Average temperatures on our planet currently range from -25 degrees Celsius in the arctic regions to 45 degrees Celsius at the equator, so how can an increase of only 1 degree make that much of a difference? Also if we consider the history, we learn of similar conditions, including very serious floods, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, etc. during periods when average global temperatures were considerably cooler.

Our government has been trying to control the weather by \"cloud seeding\", spraying very toxic chemicals like silver iodide, liquid propane (just imagine what happens when flames from forest fires reach these chemicals ), and carbon dioxide, which eventually blow in the air, affecting the soil, animals, and people everywhere. People are the cause of most fires (intentionally or accidentally), but God Almighty sends the lightening, and winds. Climate change-the LORD God Almighty is His name, and global warming is God's final warning, because of too much rebellion, sin, and wicked hearts within! Praying for God's mercy on all! Jeremiah 10:12‚Äì13, \"He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, And hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion. When He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, And He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings with rain, And bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures.\" Nahum 1:3, \"The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, And will not at all acquit the wicked: The LORD hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, And the clouds are the dust of His feet.\" Psalm 148:8, \" Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling His word:\" Matthew 24:7, \"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\"  2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, \" And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power;  Malachi 4:1,2, \" For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.\" Isaiah 13:9-13, \"Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in His going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.\" Revelation 14:7, \"Fear God and give glory to Him for the hour of His judgment has come!\" \nOmega is the last Greek hurricane named for 2020. Praying our LORD will be here soon to end all this evil corruption. Revelation 1:8, \" I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\" May God bless, and keep you always, walking in His Truth.
