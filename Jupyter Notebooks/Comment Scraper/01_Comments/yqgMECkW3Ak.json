So, the purported climate change touted by environmentalist groups, pertains specifically to the claim that significant changes to long-term Earth climate are indicated to be caused primarily by a slight additional output of carbon dioxide due to human industry. It has been a long term scheme to more tightly regulate and tax commercial and personal activity, and given the value of the \"climate change\" industry (the fees - \"donations\", lawsuit awards and settlements, unnecessary regulatory fees - energy companies and customers pay to keep activists from disrupting their activities), it's unfortunately unlikely to cease. Hydrocarbon fuels (improperly indicated to be \"fossil fuels\") have been, and will continue to be a boon to humanity. Hydrocarbon fuels \"saved the whales\" (humans previously utilized whale oil for illumination sources), freed humans from bondage (industrial machinery powered by hydrocarbon fuels freed humans from a substantial amount of physical labor), created a more humane world for domesticated animals (e.g., combines versus oxen), reduced air pollution relative to human population, created energy sufficient to extend the useful hours of the day to expand education and socialization, and enabled chemistry that contributes substantially to food preservation and medical device technologies that significantly improve and extend human life (e.g., plastics produced from petrochemical stocks).\n\nMost everything progressive politics claims as a policy goal, already exists and is a perquisite developed by the expansion of hydrocarbon fuel use and free market activities over time.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "D.

It does this by forcing the US to lower its fake 'greenhouse gas' emissions (LOL) by 50% in 2040 if the US does not withdraw. With the Paris agreement, it has been forecasted that the trade deficit would be so high that it would take away 8% of GDP from economic growth by the next 20 years which will make US less competitive against china who wants to take over the world via 'neocolonialism', exploiting the climate change hoax and the 'belt and road' initiative. Similarly, the Paris agreement would increase unemployment in the mining/energy industry by up to 12% if implemented. These miners, engineers etc will be begging for jobs but there would be none by 2040. They would rely on welfare consequently which is a form of SOCIALISM which will transition to MARXISM and STALINISM and MADUROISM and LENINISM. The US  would then be poorer.

And, his patriotism overshadows any personality faux pas he has made in the past.  I now like the man you shoots from the hip, says something is BS when it is BS. I prefer straight talk to smooth talk that many who are practiced at the art of deception hide behind.  With Trump, what you see is what you get.

Intelligent people know that Climate Change is happening, as it always has because it is cyclical.  It is NOT man made.  Climate Change is controlled by the Sun and Solar CYCLES!!  Pollution, on the other hand, IS man made and comes more from Los Angeles, China and India, NOT the United States as a whole.  That is why he intelligently pulled out of the Paris Climate Crap.   Look up Solar Cycles. Climate Change is happening to every planet in the Solar System and as far as we know, there are no SUV's on any of them.                                                                                                       We are also being attacked by those very people who want you to believe in man made climate change with Weather Control Technology.  The Powers That Be, the Deep State (who Trump is dismantling as I type this) have the ability to create, stop or control any weather they choose.  Anyone with enough money can BUY weather on the internet.  Climate Global Control Trading LLC  https://climateviewer.com/2018/09/22/climate-global-control-trading-llc-creates-steers-hurricanes-with-ionospheric-modification-cloud-ionization/  Also rain, hail, snow, floods, droughts, earthquakes   Look it UP!!! \n\nThe mainstream media is complicit in the crimes of the Deep State and Democrats.  They are their propaganda arm.  The 6 Corporate owned networks have been working with the CIA for a very long time.  Look up Project Mockingbird Look up the Bill that Obama signed, \"The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act\" making it legal to lie to the American People.\n\nAnd, sorry Cadence, just like the fake news you keep repeating the lie over and over again hoping people will eventually accept it as truth.  What scandals?  Proof?    His campaign staff, family and Trump himself were spied on, wire tapped before he was elected. They got nothing on him. There were several countries, and traitors working day and night trying to dig up dirt on him, there was the over two year $30Million Mueller Investigation, they came up with nothing but innuendos and opinions. There was the illegal House Impeachment Inquiry with 17 witnesses, none of whom had any facts only opinions, assumptions and allegations. (Did you watch any of the hearings that they \"allowed\" the public to see?)  Everything that has been alleged against President Trump that you see in the media is a lie. If they had something, anything real, they would be able to legally do something.  They can't.  There is no dirt/  The Democrats and the Media are fighting to save their own skins.  They are the ones who have committed so many crimes that they don't want Trump to expose, which he will, they will stop at nothing, no matter how reckless, stupid, or who it hurts, to save themselves from the gallows.\n\nIf they could find nothing on Trump that was a true scandal or crime after all the investigations, spying and wire tapping and all they have accused him of with absolutely no proof, all that and they can't bring him down, why?  because he is clean. You may not like the way he speaks but he is honest.   Do your own research and think for yourself.  Get out from under your programming, stop watching these liars.

They don't care about the planet.  They care about control of the people on the planet.  The US has cleaned up its carbon emissions more than any other country, (though carbon dioxide is good for the planet and all vegetation which in turn is good for all wildlife, you know ......the ecosystem?  \nThe planet goes through cycles and will go through this one due to the our own Sun and the Galactic Sun at the center of the Milky Way.  You can't stop it.  You can clean up the pollution and the oceans and the water, but you can't change the Sun cycles.  We have technology to clean up the entire planet that is being intentionally suppressed by the very people who are trying to alarm the populace with their dire warnings and blame it all on the people.

CO2 has an incredible property to reflect infrared radiation to some extent (heat), while UV passes through it. UV light from the sun passes through the CO2 as it enters the atmosphere, and the light shifts spectrum down to infrared after hitting the Earth. Most of this energy is absorbed by the earth, but some is reflected back to space.  With the increased C02 in the atmosphere, infrared radiation cannot escape the CO2 barrier lining the atmosphere, and because of it, global temperatures increase.\n\nHave you seen a global temperature vs co2 emissions graph? They are so similar you could easily mistake one for the other. they have a causal correlation that we can directly notice by measuring temperature and CO2 and then comparing. And im hoping i dont have to argue that we are releasing Co2 by emitting fossil fuels.

{"cid": "UgzLtMcaQJSoh2oZycZ4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

The reason is that in 2008, Peterson did a meta-study on the number of studies who predicted that global cooling will come instead of global warming: 7 out 61 studies showed that this claim was true. Meaning that around 11% of scientists who engaged in this area of research affirm this. And that happened when climate science was a new field. Now there is practically consensus on this issue between scientists and non scientist, given the great amount of proof that validates this process. \n\n\nActually, Al Gore never said that in 10 years there will be an ice age. It was a climate denier blog that falsely invented that story and then became a myth. \n\n\nOf course Europe went through a Little  Ice Age because the greenhouse effect wasn't enhanced yet. There were very very very little polluting industries who did not impacted Earth's climate that much because their greenhouse gases weren't produced massively, just a little; therefore, making a very small impact on Earth's climate.\n\n\nIt is evident that Europe went through a little Ice Age because of the planet's actions itself. But in this case, it has been proved over and over that man is causing this by emitting a large amount of greenhouses gases such as CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorcarbons, whose big emissions impacted on Earth's warming significantly.\n\n\nPlease stop denying climate science using strawmans.

The fact that Time decided to make one article when climatology was recently growing as a science it is not an indicator that global cooling was what the majority of scientist predicted. Actually, Peterson in the meta-study \"The myth of the 1970s global cooling scientific consensus\" affirms that around 12% (i don't remember the exact numer) of studies made in that time were predicting global cooling, whilst the rest didn't. Also, I highly doubt that the majority of climatologists that made studies concerning future changes in climate where interviewed, since it is impossible for the magazine to compress nearly a 100 statements in one article.\r\n\r\nConcerning your second point, yes they were. Around the 2000s blogging was a major activity in the internet, so it did exist.\r\n\r\nIn reference of what you said on the third paragraph, it is natural indeed. The greenhouse effect it's highly beneficial because it helps us maintain Earth's temperature in living standards. If not for it, we would be extinct. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that in the last decades, greenhouses gases have been emitted in surplus, and given that these gases have the property of retaining heat in the atmosphere, it means that Earth's mean temperature is rising. It has been proven many times that this augmentation is caused due to human activities such as combustion of cars, ship, plane engins, burning coal, raising cattle, or paddy fielding. \n\n\nOf course that a volcanic eruption produces that amount of greenhouse gases, but do you realize how many times those kind of eruption happen? Probably once in 10000 years, because it is like an IEV 7 (last time it was Krakatoa). Also, the NOAA supports what I am affirming \"\r\rHuman activities emit 60 or more times the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes each year. Large, violent eruptions may match the rate of human emissions for the few hours that they last, but they are too rare and fleeting to rival humanity‚Äôs annual emissions. In fact, several individual U.S. states emit more carbon dioxide in a year than all the volcanoes on the planet combined do.\" \n\n\nLastly, about Obama. Well, I am not Obama but i'm pretty sure he did because he is not living 200 years. Rising sea levels (if not halted) will increase 7 metres globally in a couple of hundred years.

Its effects would be the following:\n\n\n\"The heatwaves seen in Europe during 2003, which killed tens of thousands of people, will come back every year with a 2¬∞C global average temperature rise. Southern England will regularly see summer temperatures of around 40¬∞C. The Amazonian rainforest will turn into desert and grasslands, and increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere will make the world's oceans too acidic for any remaining coral reefs and thousands of other marine life forms. More than 60 million people, mainly in Africa, will be exposed to higher rates of malaria. Agricultural yields around the world will drop, exposing half a billion people to a greater risk of starvation. The west Antartic ice sheet will collapse, the Greenland ice sheet will melt and the world's sea level will begin to rise by 7 metres over the next few hundred years. Glaciers all over the world will recede, reducing the fresh water supply for major cities, including Los Angeles. Coastal flooding will affect more than 10 million extra people. A third of the world's species will become extinct if the 2¬∞C rise changes their habitats too quickly for them to adapt.\"\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure no one wants this to happen and that's the reason why everyone is freaking out concerning cutting emissions significantly by 2030.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Said Chahud", "channel": "UCGA_JUTHCDmT0ZZdNjCIclg", "votes": "8", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTPQE0rZcy0IJQGJiKyS1-qjjdkxd7oyQL6Jg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugxx18TPiduhmFhsNll4AaABAg", "text": "The 97 per cent figure derives from a survey sent to 10,257 people with a self-interest in human-induced global warming who published ‚Äúscience‚Äù supported by taxpayer-funded research grants. Replies from 3146 respondents were whittled down to 77 self-appointed climate ‚Äúscientists‚Äù of whom 75 were judged to agree that human-induced warming was taking place. The 97 per cent figure derives from a tribe with only 75 members. What were the criteria for rejecting 3069 respondents? There was no mention that 75 out of 3146 is 2.38 per cent. We did not hear that 2.38 per cent of climate scientists with a self-interest agreed that humans have played a significant role in changing climate and that they are recipients of some of the billions spent annually on climate research.\n\nAnother recent paper on the scientific consensus of human-induced climate change was a howler. Such papers can be published only in the sociology or environmental literature.\n\nThe paper claimed that published scientific papers showed there was a 97.1 per cent consensus that man had caused at least half of the 0.7C global warming since 1950. How was this 97.1 per cent figure determined? By ‚Äúinspection‚Äù of 11,944 published papers. Inspection is not rigorous scholarship. There was no critical reading and understanding derived from reading 11,944 papers. This was not possible as the study started in March 2012 and was published in mid-2013, hence only a cursory inspection was possible. What was inspected? By whom?\n\nThe methodology section of the publication gives the game away. ‚ÄúThis letter was conceived as a ‚Äòcitizen science‚Äô project by volunteers contributing to the Skeptical Science website (www.skepticalscience.com). In March 2012, we searched the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science for papers published from 1991-2011 using topic searches for ‚Äòglobal warming‚Äô or ‚Äòglobal climate change‚Äô.‚Äù\n\nThis translates as: This study was a biased compilation of opinions from non-scientific, politically motivated volunteer activists who used a search engine for key words in 11,944 scientific papers, were unable to understand the scientific context of the use of ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù and ‚Äúglobal climate change‚Äù, who rebadged themselves as ‚Äúcitizen scientists‚Äù to hide their activism and ignorance, who did not read the complete papers and were unable to evaluate critically the diversity of science published therein.\n\nThe conclusions were predictable because the methodology was not dispassionate and involved decisions by those who were not independent.\n\nAs part of a scathing critical analysis of this paper by real scientists, the original 11,944 papers were read and the readers came to a diametrically opposite conclusion. Of the 11,944 papers, only 41 explicitly stated that humans caused most of the warming since 1950 (0.3 per cent). Of the 11,944 climate ‚Äúscience‚Äù papers, 99.7 per cent did not say that carbon dioxide caused most of the global warming since 1950. It was less than 1 per cent and not one paper endorsed a man-made global warming catastrophe.\n\nPolitical policy and environmental activism rely on this fraudulent 97 per cent consensus paid for by the taxpayer to rob the taxpayer further with subsidies for bird-and-bat-chomping wind turbines, polluting solar panels and handouts to those with sticky fingers in the international climate industry. It‚Äôs this alleged 97 per cent consensus that has changed our electricity from cheap and reliable to expensive and unreliable.\n\nActivists with no skin in the game are setting the scene for economic suicide.

This means that where you live, the weather, as you know it to be, will change a bit, due to this rotational wobble, I mentioned earlier. In reality, the weather at your Longitudinal and Latitudinal address today, will change, and thus your weather will change to the new address, where as there was really no change at all, only a global locational change. It's not your fault, but a wobble induced change till effect us all every 80-120 years or so.\n\nIf you wish to follow the weather patterns, you will have to move to the new address, and you should be in the same weather patterns as you have become accustomed to.\n\nNOTE: There are those, for Political reasons and their own financial gain, have blown this fake GLOBAL WARMING term, beyond reality for the effect of \"Fear\" on your part.

We are the main cause of this increase. CO2 is now over 400ppm and this is the problem, it will trap in more of the radiation from the sun, this will drive up global temperatures, this in turn will not just melt the ice caps (which will reduce the amount of ice and basically one of the few areas on earth that reflect sunlights energy back out to space) but cause more extreme fluctuations in our weather system, creating greater heat waves, bigger storms and hurricanes, and even harsher winters in the northern hemisphere. All in all this is something we can change, but the time to act is now. At the end of the day, sire, it probably won't end up screwing you over, but in 80 years the planet will be f**ked, your children will be the ones who pay the price for the last 150 years of abuse to the planet. All of this information is pretty readily available, there are basically no Scientist who don't actually agree that humans have caused this increase in CO2, and there are basically no Scientist who don't understand the implications of CO2 levels being this high. Unfortunately, a large amount of companies around the world would have to spend a lot of money to change their businessess to be more environmentally friendly, these are the same companies who have interests within the government, and helped fund the campaign for Trump. They all understand that they can just carry on living it up, knowing full well they won't be around to suffer the consequences. \n\nAlso here is a fun Google for you to do. Plot the increase in CO2 bs population growth. \n\nLook, of you have made it this far, do you research, check the studies for yourself and make your own conclusions. Just look at who or what company funded any study or research that says this isn't caused by humans.

How much would companies pay to manipulate the public in the other direction? So 99.99% of scientists are in consensus that climate change is real, and is deeply affetced by levels of CO2. Strangely enough, a few scientists who stand to earn monetary gain if they produce results that show climate change isn't real, very often do. Almost exclusively. Like that guy, Larry Bell, who has a book and a foundation which is based on those facts. So the majority of people who spend their lives studying this problem, all comes up with the same results, and earn no extra money for it.\n\nNow let me ask you again: Who do you think tries to manipulate the public? By the way, climate change caused by excessive CO2 in the air has been known for about 100 years, it's HOW it's affecting us that's coming to light now.\n\nHere's another example: In 1930 Clair Cameron Patterson noticed that people were getting sick from lead (Chemical name Pb) from excessive pollution from cars. He understood it's because lead was used as an oil-component, and entered a legal rights case against General Motors (United States largest car-producer, and owner of Ethyl Corporations which produced this lead-based component), which lasted about 35 years. General Motors hired their own scientist (Robert A. Kehoe) to prove lead was safe, which he could \"prove\" because you an manipulate data quite easily. And so people kept getting sick and dying (Yes, dying) for another 35 years, until the public was finally convinced and action could be taken. You say that it's for monetary gain, but you never asked who stands most to lose? You think it's a coincidence that USA has a president who \"doesn't believe in climate change\" while also being heavily invested in oil? You see, climate-change policies would benefit everyone, because there's no monopolies, and no people would/could really stand as \"winners\", because geopolitical issues regarding renewable energy sources has yet to come (Well not in a large scale.

Your ignorance is most likely caused by the Dunn-Kurginger (probably misspelt) Effect. I‚Äôll try to stop or at least reduce your ignorance. Everything is made out of atoms. Atoms are the building block of all baryotic matter. An atom is made out of protons, neutrons, and electrons. An electron is a small object that circles around the atom. The electron carries a negative charge. Not too complicated, is it. Now imagine that light is a cookie, and electrons are children. Children are picky; they only want whole amounts of cookies. They don‚Äôt want a half cookie, a 2/3 cookie, they ONLY want a whole number of cookies (1,2,3...). Electrons are the same way. They only absorb certain values of light. Now when the Sun‚Äôs light hits the atmosphere, the electrons only take in certain wavelengths of the light. Now the light has entered earth. When the light enters earth the reflects off of various objects and then starts moving toward space. But there is a barrier blocking the light from escaping the earth‚Äîthe electrons. Remember, the electron only takes in certain wavelengths of light, and the light going towards space does not have the wavelength needed for the electron to let it through. All electrons do this, but electrons from greenhouse gases are the most picky, making light harder to escape them. It‚Äôs like having a door but with the wrong key to unlock it. Because of this, the light is trapped and it stays on earth. This heats up to earth due to the conversion of radiant energy to thermal energy. Congrats, now you‚Äôve had an introductory lesson in quantum mechanics! Now, everything I said is of course blasphemy, the government just wants you to believe that‚Äîright? Except that this phenomenon has been directly observed google ‚Äúultraviolet catastrophe‚Äù and it was done independent of climate change research.

CO2 still warms up the atmosphere regardless of what technology we have. It‚Äôs basic QM.

In this case, the laws of physics forbid you being able to capture all the heat made by CO2 and other greenhouse gases. If we want to stop global warming, a simple machine won‚Äôt cut it. We‚Äôd have to stop emitting so much CO2. Nuclear power is the best power we have and it‚Äôs harmless. Nuclear power also provides more energy than power plants. This is a very good alternative.

I mentioned this earlier but we should focus more funds on an alternate more effective source of power such as nuclear or geothermal, not air or hydro which won‚Äôt commonly be found in space. If we were to use air power on mars, we would either get barely any air or harsh winds that would break the windmill. And there are no known rivers on mars that would be able to support hydro power which is why i believe in nuclear and geothermal. You‚Äôre completely right in everything you said but i just have a different focus and way to go about climate change. But i think we can both agree most people nowadays are taking things out of proportion for monetary gain (you donate money and they keep a lot of it). Also the media uses the headlines of climate change to freak people out and gain more views. Well i think we had a productive conversation and nice exchange of ideas.

This extreme reduction in CO2 is the result of sea life using the CO2 to make shells. More CO2 in the atmosphere means healthier plant life and consequently more food.

You also see a lot of crops that people rely on for food struggle to grow as floods are more common. May I add quick that both sea level rising and more flooding is also evidence that the earth is warming. You say warming is better but it‚Äôs the rate of which it‚Äôs warming that‚Äôs problematic, our structures and habitats aren‚Äôt adapted for such warming. The hockey stick is a lie? That was a controversial a while ago about the methodology of the graph the results weren‚Äôt debated. The Methodology was changed and studies went through to even show that the results wouldn‚Äôt Change with correct methodology. It‚Äôs interesting you just massively contradicted yourself throughout the last two paragraphs, you say ‚Äúthe gradual increase in temp is a lie‚Äù  but you then go to say about carbon releases from the warming of the ocean?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "L TINGS", "channel": "UCz9yTEMralkizJdCXH5o9bw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRKD13UEBsWjCKoxNsZ7b12MEJ17uDqDj7IBA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The number of times, it says uncertain, believed to.., cannot predict, adjusted, normalized, is mind dazzling. Many scientist, who  contributed to these reports exposed the scam and corruption.

{"cid": "UgwxE1M4PUV_OX2BCA94AaABAg", "text": "Dear mr. Trump,\nThere's one very good motive for this Co2-global warming scam and this is it:\nThe global monetary system has come in the greatest crisis ever. In fact all of the system's banks are basically bankrupt.\nThe central banks have been 'printing' money by huge amounts in the form of buying government bonds. But it's not enough to save the monetary system. Someone came up with a brilliant idea. 'What if the whole world beliefs we have too much Co2 in the atmosphere that drives up temperature and we need huge investments (more debts) to reduce Co2.'' Already governments have policies and international agreements to invest thousands of billions for Co2 reduction. This will rescue the financial system and gear up world economics as it always did, by creating debt with the banks. It is advertised on every tv channel, in every newspaper or magazine, that the world is in great danger because of Co2. It's almost like a holy church. If you don't belief in it, they will call you names like 'extreme right wing populist', 'nationalist', some won't hesitate to even call you a fascist every time you are opposing the doctrine of the climate-church. \n\nThey may call you a 'conspiracy thinker' and the likes. But the truth is, that the financial system ran out of fuel. This happened in history before. Every time it did it was followed by a destructive war and some of these wars cost millions of peoples their lives. If I had to choose between the Co2 scam, or the war, I would choose for the scam. But why didn't we choose to fund the thousands of billions to reduce poverty in the world instead? That would have been a great world wide project too and it wouldn't have taken a dirty scam to refill the banks with debts. Give it a thought.

And if global warming is real, by 2050 most city will be flooded, do you still think you can get a 30 year mortgage if that's the case. No you can't. I'm not American nor am I a trump supporter, in fact I don't really like him. The reason why he said it is a hoax and never explain is if he really explain, do you still think you Americans and the whole wide world will obediently pay your carbon emission tax? No you won't. That's why he did not explain and said it was a money making scheme. But you will say that carbon emission is not good for the planet. Yes it is, but did you know most carbon emission is from the ocean? If that's the case than why do you think the carbon you emitted into the air is going to cause the rise in temperature.

Which are always impossible to meet, and therefore costs countries around the world trillions when combined. \nAnd there is no real record of where that money goes. \nWhile I will agree that Climate Change and Global Warming does need addressing I cannot agree that it's as bad as they make out nor that it is entirely humans fault.\nThe climate itself is changing drastically, even if humans weren't here, the temperature of thee environment would still be increasing. \nThe earth goes through its own climate changes every now and then and we have to take that into serious consideration when looking into climate change. \n\nAlso, one of the worst offenders that cause probably the worst amount of sheer damage to the environment and earth itself are people on Vegan diets.\nVegan food producers are responsible for destroying millions of acres of rainforests. To the point that when the producers stop producing soya, the ground/soil will no longer have the nuitriants to grow any plant life at all!\nSo the rainforest will never be able to grow back.\nOn top of that, with the alarming amount of trees they've taken down they have taken billions of pounds of oxygen out of the environment which we will never be able to recover. Plus, the sheer amount of CO2 that isn't being absorbed by trees is also adding to our lack of breathable air. \nNot to mention the billions of animals and bugs being wiped out. Bugs that also protect us by devouring decaying bodies and other things. \nVegans are not helping, and neither is the amount of overconsumption by meat and dairy eaters - overconsumption that ends up not actually being consumed and adds to the crazy amount of waste produced. \n\nWe don't need things like the Paris Agreement. We need to regress back to how we used to consume. \nDitch unhealthy Vegan diets and slow down with the amount of food eaten every day, go back to 3 normal meals a day and cut out all the junk we consume and waste.

It is an integral part of the carbon cycle, a biogeochemical cycle in which carbon is exchanged between the Earth's oceans, soil, rocks and the biosphere. Plants and other photoautotrophs use solar energy to produce carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. Almost all other organisms depend on carbohydrate derived from photosynthesis as their primary source of energy and carbon compounds. CO2 absorbs and emits infrared radiation at wavelengths of 4.26 ¬µm (asymmetric stretching vibrational mode) and 14.99 ¬µm (bending vibrational mode) and consequently is a greenhouse gas that plays a vital role in regulating Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.\n\nConcentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000 parts per million (ppm) during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 ppm during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years. Estimates based on reconstructed temperature records suggests that the amount of CO2 during the last 420 million years ago was with ~2000 ppm highest during the Devonian (‚àº400 Myrs ago) and Triassic (220‚Äì200 Myrs ago), with a few maximum estimates ranging up to ‚àº3,700¬±1,600 ppm (215 Myrs ago). Global annual mean CO2 concentration has increased by more than 45% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century[2] to 410 ppm as of mid-2018. The present concentration is the highest in the last 800,000 and possibly even the last 20 million years. The increase has been caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This increase of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere has produced the current episode of global warming.

As our Earth's climates have changed - due to the variable levels of CO2 (among other gases) - throughout the Earth's history, we have witnessed a variety of unique global environments. The ages of the dinosaur saw a climate very different than any other time period, lasting millions of years. Then 'something' changed and the Earth evolved to its present state. We are now living in what we call the Cenozoic Age or Epoch and it is classified by the most varied life forms of plants and animals in the entire Earth's history! Pretty impressive!!!! Ironically though, the Cenozoic Era has been a period of long-term cooling. After the tectonic creation of Drake Passage at 41 million years ago, when South America fully detached from Antarctica during the Oligocene, the climate cooled significantly due to the advent of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which brought cool deep Antarctic water to the surface. The cooling trend continued in the Miocene, with relatively short warmer periods. When South America became attached to North America creating the Isthmus of Panama around 2.8 million years ago, the Arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the Humboldt and Gulf Stream currents, eventually leading to the glaciations of the Quaternary ice age. So this should impress upon any readers just how significant and magical climate change actually is. The issue now facing humanity is the fact that our burning of fossil fuels and many other activities is affecting the dynamics of our atmosphere and our oceans.

The atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, which are both gases made up of molecules containing two atoms. These tightly bound pairs don't absorb much heat. But the greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane, each have at least three atoms in their molecules. These loosely bound structures are efficient absorbers of the long-wave radiation (also known as heat) bouncing back from the planet's surface. When the molecules in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases re-emit this long-wave radiation back toward Earth's surface, the result is warming. Scientists also know that the extra carbon in the atmosphere is the very same carbon that comes from burning fossil fuels. By analyzing molecular variations called isotopes, researchers can trace the origin of atmospheric carbon. That's not to say that the climate is as simple as an actual greenhouse. Many factors influence global temperatures, including volcanic eruptions and variations in the solar cycle and Earth's orbit that alter the amount of sunlight reaching the planet. But scientists know that volcanoes and the sun aren't to blame for recent climate change. Volcanic carbon dioxide emissions have been, at most, a hundredth of human CO2 emissions since 1750. In addition, volcanic eruptions cause changes for short timescales of about two years, not the longer-term changes being observed currently. The sun is more complex, but researchers have found that the recent solar-cycle minimum (between 1986 and 2008) was actually lower than the previous two solar-cycle minimums (the sun moves between quiet minimums and active maximums about once every five years). If anything, recent solar activity should have resulted in cooling, not warming. Likewise, a 2012 study found that between 2005 and 2010, a period when solar activity was low, the Earth still absorbed 0.58 watts of excess energy per square meter, continuing to warm despite the lower level of solar energy going into the system.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jim Kogelheide", "channel": "UC9lmaYoI_5AzSORZQvNvyhA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRSif32SqNTJwWGCZkWNe2cggk82-bvBCj6_AEn=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States.\nGreen leaves use energy from sunlight through photosynthesis to chemically combine carbon dioxide drawn in from the air with water and nutrients tapped from the ground to produce sugars, which are the main source of food, fiber and fuel for life on Earth. Studies have shown that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide increase photosynthesis, spurring plant growth.\nHowever, carbon dioxide fertilization isn‚Äôt the only cause of increased plant growth‚Äînitrogen, land cover change and climate change by way of global temperature, precipitation and sunlight changes all contribute to the greening effect. To determine the extent of carbon dioxide‚Äôs contribution, researchers ran the data for carbon dioxide and each of the other variables in isolation through several computer models that mimic the plant growth observed in the satellite data.\nResults showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect, said co-author Ranga Myneni, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environment at Boston University. ‚ÄúThe second most important driver is nitrogen, at 9 percent. So we see what an outsized role CO2 plays in this process.‚Äù\nAbout 85 percent of Earth‚Äôs ice-free lands is covered by vegetation. The area covered by all the green leaves on Earth is equal to, on average, 32 percent of Earth‚Äôs total surface area - oceans, lands and permanent ice sheets combined. The extent of the greening over the past 35 years ‚Äúhas the ability to fundamentally change the cycling of water and carbon in the climate system,‚Äù said lead author Zaichun Zhu, a researcher from Peking University, China, who did the first half of this study with Myneni as a visiting scholar at Boston University.\nEvery year, about half of the 10 billion tons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere from human activities remains temporarily stored, in about equal parts, in the oceans and plants. ‚ÄúWhile our study did not address the connection between greening and carbon storage in plants, other studies have reported an increasing carbon sink on land since the 1980s, which is entirely consistent with the idea of a greening Earth,‚Äù said co-author Shilong Piao of the College of Urban and Environmental Sciences at Peking University.\nWhile rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years.

{"cid": "UgyyjkJ1Vpi08egHuYB4AaABAg", "text": "The reason for state intervention to prevent external effects of environmental pollution. \n\nIn theory, a perfect market economy, the principle of free exchange and free pricing lead to a Pareto-efficient distribution of individual benefits. In reality, in every economy, whether planned or open there are market failures. This is empirical fact not only proven by many economists like Joseph E. Stiglitz in the field of financial science, game theory but also throughout history (see US Subprime crisis or the collapse of the Sowjet Union). \n\nThe welfare theorem shows that the market fundamentally leads to a Pareto-efficient allocation. Although, the market economy does not provide an efficient allocation under the following conditions:\n\n1.External effects 2. Incomplete competition 3. Incomplete information\n\nState intervention can increase welfare and affect more than just property rights and tax collection. External effects arise when the advantages and disadvantages of economic activity incurred by other people are not compensated by prices. Environmental pollution and thus resulting climate change is the perfect example. Individual benefit maximization then does not necessarily lead to the macroeconomic benefit maximum. Please compare the Prisoner's Dilemma. \n\nUncoordinated behavior can lead to Pareto-inefficient allocation. For instance, the installation of a catalyst in a car has a positive external effect, which is not taken into account in individual benefit maximization. Same goes for cerosin prices which do not reflect real cost taking into account the negative external effects on the climate. \n\nTo prevent such failures the public sector should perform three main functions. Allocation, distribution, and stabilization. Possible instruments are taxes, subventions regulations or public provision of goods, services, and finance. \n\nIf the nations on earth do not coordinate individual behavior on environmental pollution and put policies in place to achieve the agreed 1.5 grad celsius temperature raise form the Paris agreement by 2050 greenhouse emission will continue to rise. Then, in 12 only to years from now, the earth will fall into so-called positive feedback loops and humanity won't make it through that.

Now here‚Äôs the real scandal of the near trillion dollars that governments have stolen from taxpayers to fund climate change hysteria and research. By the industry‚Äôs own admission there has been almost no progress worldwide in actually combatting climate change. Has there ever been such a massive government expenditure that has had such miniscule returns on investment? After three decades of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and the greatest minds of the world entrusted with hundreds of billions of dollars can only come up with a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù for the world to stop using fossil fuels, which is like saying that we should stop growing food.\n\n\nBut you probably already knew that from your \"thousands\" upon \"countless research\".

I KNOW that Trump is stymied and blocked at every turn, but I also know that he has planned for \"their\" opposition, and always has some unique way of getting around them.  He never makes a claim or a statement that he cannot back up with proof. \n\nSo, you think that the fact that he has been pulling troops out of Syria for months is something that THEY \"want\" him to do?  Or, that taking that shipping lane in California away from China (Obama's gift) and selling it to Australia (I believe) is something THEY wanted him to do? Or, the China trade deal that is fundamentally giving American Farmers 4 times the profit (remember the naysayers saying he was going to start a war, or that Farmers were suffering?) A little short term pain for long term gain is something that All Americans understand and do on a regular basis to build something better.  Trump has leaders of many countries quietly supporting him.  He has a Military Alliance who contacted him in 2014 to ask him to run for President as they had a plan to take down the corruption and the Pedophiles in this country and the world.\n\nJust when you think it looks bleak on the outside looking in, you should know that it is all for show.  Trump wants the Democrats, the Globalists and the Deep State to continue to expose themselves, so that by the time the indictments are unsealed and they are arrested, the people will be so sick of them they will not resist.  Until he could make sure that there would not be a civil war with blood in our streets, with people stupidly fighting to defend those who would ultimately enslave them, he chose to do things slowly and orchestrate the timing of certain events for maximum effect.  Pay attention.  Add up all that he has accomplished since in office.  Can you do that?  When you do that research for yourself, no one can take that away from you.  I you just listen to what others say, you will fall for just about anything.  \nThings are working out.  So, many CEO's of large corporations are stepping down or being arrested.  Large Pedophile rings world wide are being busted. There are many countries that have been so inspired by America, that they want the same for themselves.  And...they LOVE President Donald Trump.  He is NOT working alone.  Not only does he have a Military Alliance, an Alliance of many world leaders, but he also has divine guidance.  It's not just us here in the physical realm who want to see President Trump succeed.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "T Young", "channel": "UCorErvaWmisW5stooyzsnNw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQFKhDlNfvVmbU9RSDdygq__xkIRPivGtNlw2IwbQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw2Yak_D1mngnAX-5t4AaABAg", "text": "Exploring Human Impact On Climate Evolution\n\nThere is clear motivation to continue society's use of fossil fuels. They are the most readily commoditized of  all available fuel sources. The energy density packed into hydrocarbon molecules fueled the advance of industrial age, to which we are all indebted. The relatively few channels through which we can access these fuels has created tremendous ability to shape all aspects of any market, be it free or highly regulated OR DICTATED.\n        What then, motivates the alleged scientific gathering of data to suggest that while the earth's climate is in regular flux, our use of natural resources has caused some kind of \"unnatural\" climate shift? We are nature, we are g-d. The earth is our gift to cherish or exploit as we see fit. And so, I personally conclude that most scientific explorations pertaining to the subject of climate chance are genuine efforts to help ensure a habitable earth for future generations.\n       Everyone is wrong at some point and to some degree. The arguments against the potential for climate change seem to rely on meaningless, contrived comparisons and general dismissal. If scientists simply dismissed these rebuttals to their hypotheses we would not have any reason to take this matter seriously. The continuing and transparent work of science to strengthen its claims encourages the ongoing debate by adding new information to the pool of consideration. The FACTS are though, that whether or not fossil fuels exacerbate climate evolution, they take an enormous toll on the ecosystems that they come into contact with by changing the chemistry and topography of water and land more quickly than most life can adapt. Not to mention, the recovery of naturally sequestered hydrocarbons is the leading cause for land disputes among individuals, communities, and even governments.\n       The extreme  defensive posture assumed by hydrocarbon fanatics eludes to the coordinated effort from the hydrocarbon industry to protect their market share. The campaign to discredit potential dangers of hydrocarbon exploitation dates back almost to the birth of the industry. Fossil fuel necessity is then, quite naturally reinforced by our current dependence on fossil fuels to maintain our modern lifestyle.  \n          WE ARE MASTERS OF THIS EARTH. THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM OUR EXPLORING SOMETHING ''NEW''. No reasonable person expects hydrocarbons to immediately, or ever, become outlawed. There will likely always be sectors that rely on mined hydrocarbons for a variety of reasons. What is being suggested (by rational scientists) is that we as a species would very likely find it to be in our collective interest to diversify our energy portfolio to include systems that reduce the need for energy as they increase our ability to produce it anywhere, by individuals and municipalities alike. \n           I hope that really struck a nerve with everyone on both sides of this debate. It boils down to a dramatic shift in the balance of \"power\". Power to sustain, to produce, and to govern. That is why the hydrocarbon side of this debate is so acutely organized in their methods of planting doubt, by mis-aligning comparisons to reinforce any ideologies they deem beneficial to maintaining their market dominance. The balance of power is literally at stake. \n           Please remember, I think we are all as good as we can be, doing what we think will ensure a bright future. The only people who would demonize  each other for adhering to their respective beliefs cannot envision change and are looking to shore up the flimsy ground they themselves stand on. No one is bad for benefiting from/enjoying our current hydrocarbon exploitation, but to shirk responsibly for ensuring a productive earth for as long as possible is in my opinion inexcusable. Everyone is as much a part of the perceived problem as they are the perceived solution. Who wants tea?\n             Best advice ever, because I like you, there is more to gain from an unbiased understanding of world history than a subjective interpretation of current events.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "xHappySnowmanx", "channel": "UCOnCuRMnoDvFZcxV6er_JwA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRhEfVcXEzJNkMNx-eQ_6KKjid63-g0ABKPo3w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Of course it does, the climate has always changed. There is evidence going back thousands of years to support that.‚Äù\n\nCoun Chilvers said his council colleague‚Äôs views were a concern since, as the county‚Äôs finance portfolio holder he ‚Äòheld the purse strings‚Äô, and the council had a policy to reduce CO2 emissions and responsibility for transport projects and flooding.\n\nHe added: ‚Äú‚ÄúCouncils need to play an increasingly important role if we are to adapt to climate change especially on issues like flooding. Yet Warwickshire council has a deputy leader who doesn‚Äôt think it exists and seems to think climate scientists are making it up to keep their jobs.\n\n‚ÄúWe need our leaders to make good evidence based decisions for the future not spread half baked theories from a dark corner of the internet.‚Äù\n\nCoun Butlin was reluctant to comment but was adamant his beliefs did not impact on council decisions.\n\nHe said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my personal view and nothing to do with my role at the council.\n\n‚ÄúIn my role as councillor I‚Äôve championed the use of electric cars, I‚Äôve championed recycling, and helped on a lot of environmental issues.‚Äù\n\nCouncil leader Izzi Seccombe told the BBC while she did not agree with her deputy‚Äôs views, all councillors were entitled to their opinions and it was ‚Äòthe nature of politics‚Äô.\n\nThe beliefs echo those of President Donald Trump who declared global-warming as ‚Äòfake news‚Äô and last year pulled the US out the Paris agreement ‚Äì which aims to reduce greenhouse emission.\n\nAround three per cent of scientists believe humans are not to blame for global warming, instead believing it is caused by natural forces.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Michael H", "channel": "UCN7ToVjABTF1v83fenTZREQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT4pCqZoDBsiSbeAJaeTE2ZTtwQC3hoEkTw_MXOFQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I try to hold an 'on the fence' opinion (or at least try to see both opinions) so I am wondering about the stances of both sides. From reading articles it seems there is little room to disagree about the effect we have on the environment. NASA released a graph showing the amount of carbon dioxide emission levels has never crossed a certain line of approximately 300, 000 parts per million. In recent years, we are at around 400, 000 parts per million. Does this seem big or small considering the advancement of technology over the years? \"The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.5 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year ‚Äî from January through September, with the exception of June ‚Äî were the warmest on record for those respective months\" (NASA).

I've learned a lot in that time, but most importantly to think for myself.  Climate change proponents tend to like to cite the record breaking temperatures as evidence, but if you look at the records the temperatures are breaking they were often set 50, 70, 100 years ago or more, which to me indicates that climate fluctuation is just a natural phenomena that occurs over time.  \n\nHow much light/heat energy the earth gets from the sun is the primary factor affecting earth's regional climates and that is in turn affected by three subsequent factors:\n\n1. the earth's axial tilt which shifts over time from between 21¬∞ and 24¬∞ greatly affecting the amount of incident light energy that hits the north pole.  I would imagine the greater the tilt toward 24¬∞ (leaning more towards the sun) the less north pole ice we have.  As we tilt away the north pole ice will return and grow. \n\n2. the \"wobble\" of the earth as it spins through space.  The earth actually wobbles like a spinning top as it spins and sails through space.  This would also greatly affect the amount of incident light energy that reaches different regions of the earth.  And since the earth is relatively larger than a spinning top toy it wobbles much much more slowly quite possibly leading to brief periods (years) of anomalous weather that might be perceived by beings whose experiential time span is too short to be able to put it into proper perspective.\n\n3. Earth's orbit around the sun.  The earth orbits the sun, not in a perfect circle, but rather in an ellipse, comparable to an oval.  And as earth orbits the sun and carves a path through space it almost certainly never follows the same exact path twice.  Some years we sail a little closer to the sun and some years we sail by a little further away.  By simply looking at the other planets in our solar system we can see how greatly weather and temperature are affected by how closely a planet orbits the sun.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Truth", "channel": "UCjkSFGZldehAFz-lFxRJyCg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS_v1oKp83G4-eTrKoCqa60No53YSyRQ6aaRg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Earth's regional climates naturally fluctuate over time.  It's a result of the axial tilt of the earth, the earth's wobble, and the earth's orbital path as it sails through space and around the sun. All of those factors change over time and lead to changes in the amount of light energy that reaches different regions year to year, decade to decade and on and on to much larger time scales creating \"ages\", or eras. This creates weather patterns, which to beings with lives as short as ours, may seem seem anomalous but in the larger scheme of things is not extraordinary at all. \n\nIf you wanted to look at the average climate for any region of the earth you'd have to look at more than just the last 2 or 300 years that we have been recording data which is just a firecracker in time.  The earth is approx. 4.5 billion years old. That's 4,500,000,000 and we've been recording data for only 200 or 300!  That's the equivalent of attempting to determine the average speed of a vehicle trip from Washington, D.C. to San Diego California by just looking at the cars average speed driving a few feet on Constitution Ave. in Washington D.C. \n\nSo maybe hoax isn't right, but it's definitely poor science.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Truth", "channel": "UCjkSFGZldehAFz-lFxRJyCg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS_v1oKp83G4-eTrKoCqa60No53YSyRQ6aaRg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And it is absolutely the same in terms of objectivity to a research sponsored by say pharmaceutical or coal or energy industry. They a both biased. Everyone cites figures nobody has checked and is an instant expert on this topic. Which is of course laughable. Invariably an emotional element is added to leftists claims of people suffering and dying in floods, droughts, hurricanes, cold winters, hot summers etc. to compensate for the inconclusive data (if somebody bothers to check that date at all). Even if we assume 100% of current climate change is caused by human activity,  just for the sake of the argument, then every human being should be contributing to  reducing this causality. Everybody driving SUV should get a bike, stop using their air condition, gas stove, stop building coal power plants (yes, China included) and start living like how 2 billion people or so live now on Earth.

Do you really think it's a good system when you have to work 55 hrs/week, pay tax and STILL have to buy health insurance? And what if your condition isn't covered, or your insurance company claims it's preexisting condition, what then? Bank loan? And what happens if you find yourself unemployed and unable to keep your health insurance? \n\nAnd hospitals have to treat you in an emergency, if not they can turn you away if you can't pay. It's just stupid. So why do you pay tax? Why is it so wrong to have some of that back through healthcare?\n\nAnd if you realize that Coal is temporary, why do you applaud withdrawing from the Paris agreement? It's like saying I know this is the future, but because Obama signed it I will withdraw to make sure USA is at the back of the line.\n\nAnd BTW, much of what Trump is taking credit for is part of previously announced plans so he's not the job creator he says he is.
