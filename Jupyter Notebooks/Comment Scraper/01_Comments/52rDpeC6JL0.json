Chernobyl type accidents would be rendered impossible. A bunch of research has already been done. It's mostly figuring out what materials to use for the reactor core because liquid salt is very corrosive. Once that's done we can set up reams of thorium reactors across the nation and rapidly transition to electric cars (which is something that's happening already anyway). Cars, btw, are only some 28% of green house emissions. Electric heating and running all industry on electric where possible would cut another 30% or so. Add this to the 27% for electricity production and we get an 85% reduction in green house emissions by going thorium (or any nuclear, for that matter). Cows fart methane which is a very powerful greenhouse gas. Preventing methane from getting in the air would help a lot. I'm sure we can figure out a way to capture these farts with a cheap, reusable piece of gear we can fit to the cow. Simply lighting the methane on fire would help a lot. This device could be attached to the cows rear end, capture the methane and do a controlled burn, or it could be captured and stored for later burning (while using the energy).\nWe're only a few laws and some minor research away from having a clean world. A few dollars will fix this issue. Electric cars could be heavily subsidized so low income people could afford them.

Gases such as methane and HFCs are broken down by various reactions in the atmosphere with very little greenhouse effect overall. CO2 is estimated to have a hang time somewhere in the thousand year range, so once it's put in the air, it's there effectively permanently. This is why so little attention is paid to the greenhouse effects of HFCs, and so much attention is focused on CO2.\n\n\nForests are understood to not be particularly effective carbon sinks, as they are temporary in nature. They last only until a forest fire or flood or mass disease wipe out that forest and it has to start over again. This is compounded by warming effects which are killing off large tracts of forest in USA in Canada as conditions are made more favourable for parasites and fires.\n\n\nThe criticism that \"Cap and Trade\" cannot lower levels is incorrect, as the entire point of such a regime is that you know precisely how much total pollution is going to be created, if you can get your people/industries to comply with it. If you set the cap higher than the existing total, then your criticism is accurate, because the credits are nearly worthless and the sum total is unaffected. But if you set it at a lower level, such that the credits are undersupplied and desireable, they become expensive and incentives to lower emissions (or whatever else you're capping) become financially beneficial to the individuals who wish to buy or sell those credits. Thus, your output is known but your price is not. This is opposite of carbon taxation in which your price is known but your output is not.\n\n\nBig thumbs up for the nuclear shout out, though.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jay Enfield", "channel": "UCo9gKhS7m93cN1GQCmz6lGQ", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFxcbu5_l62ZT33iQ0rmsUX2HxmiqoIWA0j81ASQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Before that, you said that I am probably not going to change your opinion. Connect those two together. You do not change someone's opinion by just saying that they are wrong. That is not how discussion and debate works. To summarize, I would like to know this. What alternatives do we have besides oil, Natgas, and coal? Most windmills can break from receiving too much, and wind is never always continuous. Now how are those parts made? How are they transported? Oil. Solar panels hardly make much energy, and how do you produce them? Oil. Hydroelectricity, i love it, and could be good, but it can also negatively impact the environment with it being an artificial dam, but what do you think I am going to say next? It takes Oil. Sure, bring up nuclear. I think it could definitely work, but as far as I know, we do not have nuclear powered cars, and nuclear only makes up a fraction on how energy is consumed. I want to help the environment as much as I can, but not all problems with the environment are neither just the US or even greenhouse gases.

If the reactor breaks, the radioactive stuff will just drip down, where a concrete bucket will catch it. It will then cool down rapidly and not explode. Since there's nothing under high pressure in a LFTR, explosions can't occur. Not can runaway reactions. A lot of research has already been done and research is very cheap provided there's a political will. This will has been missing since uranium/plutonium has been successful enough to make the financial investment into other tech not profitable enough. Of course, it is not a question of profitability at this point. It's a question of safety and the sustainability of our way of life as well as nature (with which we are still inextricably linked, btw: an ecosystem is a complex machine, case in point: bees are needed for pollination, which is needed for food). The government can and should fund the research. These decades can be shortened to years not because it is easy but because it is required, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win. Lest we all live in a dystopia worse than one can imagine now, seeing as to how good we all have it and how unlikely it feels that things will rapidly go downhill.\nWe also have good, very very fast computers now that can aid in development, something they didn't have in the 60.

If the elephant is 20 cubic metres, that doesn't mean an elephant can fit into a box with those dimensions, because in reality, there is 'empty space' between the elephant's legs that is not being considered as part of the elephants volume, but which the elephant cannot exist without. This is perhaps a rather simplistic example that uses the word elephant far too much - but I hope my point is made. I'm not for one instant claiming hte scientists haven't considered obvious examples like mine, but all evidence points to our current population having a detrimental effect that the globe cannot mitigate against, so at best, to sustain more people we will need a dramatic change in lifestyle.

The rest of your post is also full of similar uninformed rubbish.

{"cid": "Ugz_a8rbIwE9md3Ks9J4AaABAg", "text": "YES! I'm really sick and tired of people thinking 'nuclear power bad' and 'let's just put solars and wind turbines everywhere'. Another point to add to what you've already said is cost and time to get a nuclear power plant going. To produce the same amount of power, you'd need sooo much more space, money, resources and workhours in completely reneweable solutions and we just don't have any of that, especially time. Switch to nuclear now and think about going full-wind/solar? Maybe, but we have to act now and act fast and there's just no way we can reduce fossil fuel plants to zero without building more nuclear ones, not quickly enough at least.\nI've been an advocate for nuclear power for years now and I have to say, it drives me mad how one major incident and frankly ignorant mental connection to the atomic bomb keep our societies from embracing it. Chernobyl was one-of-a-kind design which failed mostly because soviets wanted to make some plutonium for a-bombs on the side (gross oversimplification, but that is what it boils down to). EVERY other plant just physically cannot do what happened there, by design. It's like air travel, it's much, much safer than the alternative, but the bad pr is killing it, a big explosion of a nuclear power plant is way more dramatic than thousands of dead coal miners, rafinery workers etc. By the way, you'll get more rads just flying a plane somewhere or having an x-ray than in majority of Chernobyl.\nAlso, if somehow you still don't know that, no, nuclear power plants physically cannot explode like an atomic bomb. Getting a nuclear explosion going is something way different and way too difficult to happen on its own. There's a reason why it took them sl long to figure it out, you know.\nSorry for the chaotic rant, it's just really disheartening to see no one in or near power doing the one single thing they should be doing now, especially where I live. We don't have a single nuclear power plant here in Poland yet (although we do have an experimental reactor for research) and majority of politicians, who do not want us to fall deeper and deeper into the authoritarian hellhole we're currently heading towards, are against building them for no reason other than populism or plain ignorance afaik.

However, I feel it’s a little disingenuous to lump us into a category of climate change denial. I have no doubt that the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change. My problem is the percentage or fraction in which human life plays a role in it. There are certain scientific facts that you can’t argue. You cannot beat Newton’s laws. Dinosaurs did exist, the world is a sphere, and evolution is taught for a reason. My issue is when this theory becomes God. There is a psychologist would said the absence of religion makes people worship other ideas instead. Which again, more power to you. But believing in climate theory to the extent that is undeniably true takes the same leap of faith as someone who want to believe in a higher power. People like myself are not like being racist or homophobic. It is a different viewpoint as to how much of the problem is truly due to human involvement. Nuclear power is more efficient, less polluting and there is almost no drawbacks I could see. Which you cannot say about changing the cars in which people drive, the houses in which people live, the ways in which we choose to transport. When there is concrete evidence or an issue, and especially if China, India and Russia would get on board, I would be glad to see some government policy change. But as history may have shown you, and overreaching and overextended government never ends well. These people are the same people most often who will talk ill of the military industrial complex and police militarization. Well I riddle you a question.

Even if waste is minimal and stored at the plant you have to store that for 10.000 years plus. Let's assume the small amount of waist accumulates over 10.000 years before some is not radioactive anymore. The tiny amount will grow quickly to unmanageable amounts.\nThere are no working breeding reactors on the grid and it will not save us, as waste can't be bred with 100 % efficiency back to fuel. Thorium will not save us either.\nThat long term storage isn't our forte and we don't have to extrapolate theoretical studies on that. The currently available sites prove that. \nThe arguments are further somewhat flawed as nuclear isn't widely used. It only makes up like 10 % of worldwide energy production. Uranium is a limited resource too. If we would replace coal and gas with nuclear energy the uranium sources would be depleted in a couple of decades. Incicdences of \"oopsies\" with nuclear fusion increase as more plants get build.\nI really don't see this as a future energy technology.\n\nA nuclear solution would be fusion. Lithium needed to breed tritium needed for fusion is readily available in sea water and the amounts needed are tiny. ITER will run test blankets enriched with lithium to test this self sustaining fuel cycle.\nFor cars a fuel cell approach based on methanol might be a solution if we can produce it with green energy ofc.

The rate of pollution we have today, and the proyections we have for the future says that nuclear is simply not enough. Is part of the solution, and that is true, but is far from the only thing we need to cut. Meat, clothes, tecnology like phones, packaging, cars is part of the crisis, and we need to make changes now. Climate change is a big problem, the biggest to be fair, but the enviromental crisis is far worse than that. microplastics, deforestation, air pollution, water pollution, waste and trash. This problems are far less popular and they are usually put in the pile with climate change. This is true, they produce CO2 equivalent, but there is a lot of secondary problems, far worse that come with this. Acidification of the oceon for example is not just a balance problem with the CO2 that reacts. It kills wildlife, and disrupt the food chain, and that is far more difficult to measure than emisions.\nThe point with all this is simple, nuclear is not the solution, is just part of it. and the enviromental problem is far worse than you think thanks to this problems with proyections. We need a lot more, and we need to act faster than this, especially your country and the first world.

{"cid": "UgyTbTkTeivUaCoEkEp4AaABAg", "text": "I'm definitely late to the game with this comment but their is an upcoming technology that I'm just not hearing enough of that would definitely help a lot with our current energy crisis and that technology is Small Modular Nuclear reactors. Whenever someone talks about establishing nuclear energy as a clean energy source, it has become more and more popular for people to mention thorium reactors and liquid salt reactors. There is just one huge problem, thorium reactors are still very much so in between experimental phases of development; that is if anyone is still researching it at all. If I'm not mistaken, there have been working experimental thorium reactors in the 60's but other than that, the technology would require at least another 3 to 5 years of development before we could confidently use it as a main source of clean energy. While thorium itself is a Molten salt reactor, MSR's as a whole don't have this problem. In fact the U.S., as well as other countries, have already used non-thorium based molten salt reactor power plants for public commercial use.  But MSR's still pose an issue that nuclear energy as a whole  faces, that being that the upfront cost of building a nuclear power plant is enormous, so much so that nuclear power has become infamous for bankrupting companies trying to build their own plants. They also cant take up to a decade to build, and even with all that time it is still super common for construction of nuclear power plants to go well over their predicted timelines. That being said, nuclear power is still so cheap in the long run that it is actually comparable to  coal in cost, but that still doesn't make the upfront cost of building a nuclear power plant any less intimidating for a country seeking to to replace its entire energy infrastructure with nuclear. This upfront cost, along with the time issue, is why countries are looking at renewables as apposed to nuclear.  Small modular reactors pose to solve both the issue of upfront costs/time and meltdown/safety concerns. SMR's (not to be confused with MSR's) have built in safety features very similar in concept to MSR's and extensive testing has proven these safety systems to be very effective, in other words SMR's will remove the concern of a meltdown just like MSR's would. The biggest advantage is that the \"small modular\" aspect of SMR's , in layman's terms, make them the nuclear equivalent of IKEA furniture, taking advantage of already existing infrastructure to make installation of the reactors very cheap, quick, and relatively simple. Best of all, SMR's have already been approved for use on the federal level and are actually already being used right now in Canada to power major cities. Long story short, if your looking for a fast and cheap source of energy to safely replace coal, SMR's fit the bill quite well. \n\nP.S. I think it is important to note that nuclear, as amazing as it sounds, will likely not be the end all of energy when it comes to combating climate change. Some countries, like Germany, have already successfully replaced most of their energy infrastructure with wind and have made the necessary changes to their grid to accommodate wind power as a reliable source. Solar energy, while not nearly as cheap as nuclear, may very well be the fastest developing energy technology. Literally every month or so their is a new major development or research in the field of solar that makes it even better, and within a decade it will almost certainly begin to rival both coal and nuclear in terms if cost. Much like solar, battery technology has also seen rapid advancement. All and all, no one piece of technology will be the end all solution to our current energy crisis and climate change, but we will likely end up with a diverse cocktail of energy solutions being used all at once depending on the needs of individual countries.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Adam Crowe", "channel": "UCjpTMKcIITpr4R5GpSLZk9A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQhUITorUX2qbVEyH3HH_efiK-1nHBj7UbadQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwrUmwgD1aoEsV76ZF4AaABAg", "text": "Nuclear is the most efficient and reliable there is. Coal is the second most reliable, third is gas and fourth is wind. We can switch twice the amount of nuclear and reduce half the coal. But we do need coal backup in case of wind and gas plus other coal failure. Wind produces a lot when there’s wind but just doesn’t produce anything at times. Probably need more improvement of battery systems and have better coal backup. Solar underperforms a lot on a larger scale but I see that it performs well at the individual premise level. So any solar should be left to individual consumers to make investment etc... think it shouldn’t be subsidized. I also think that wind should not be subsidized also due to that it creates bad market indicators that can take coal out of market... then collapse grid when shit hits the fan and there’s no coal backup, while gas is too slow to take over or busted pipeline issues etc. If we just focus more on nuclear we can solve the energy problems of the world plus make cleaner energy.

Every species in existence has a carrying capacity, and humans are from what I have been told a species. Can you feed that large of a population yeah, but it comes at a cost. The invasion of humans tearing down ecosystems for housing, commercial, and industrial bases has horrendous effects. If you kill off enough species eventually the ecosystem will collapse. Every human in existence requires a level of energy, so by capping population I am pretty sure that it adds up to less energy needed. Not to mention I have taken two courses regarding this exact subject and both professors preach the same thing of the effects of overpopulation. Just because you don't think its a problem doesnt mean it isnt. But there is another issue with what you have said, nuclear is not a renewable source of energy, only way I think it could be is if we somehow find it on some asteroid or other planet and bring it back to earth. Though nuclear power is an answer for today's energy crisis, its not a solid solution. I agree wind and solar arent great but there has to be more development into something that will be sustainable for the rest of human existence. \n\nI agree with most everything you said here, however I think that you are also underplaying some of your solutions and devaluing the expertise of people older than you and I who have 10 times more experience in the subject.

I also appreciated your criticism of the \"overpopulation\" argument.\n\nHowever, there is one point where you made a mistake, and that's on the viability of wind & solar. For one, those farms do not \"only last a few years before they need to be replaced.\" The average lifespan of solar panels - and solar farms - that are in current production is around 20 to 30 years. Wind turbines do require more regular maintenance, but they, too, last quite a bit longer than \"a few years.\" Similarly, they amount of toxic byproducts produced by them is negligible, and solar panels in particular are between 90 to 97% recyclable at end-of-life. \n\nAnd finally, about energy storage. We've already negated the \"unreliability\" of wind & solar with broad distributed energy storage methods. I'm surprised you've never touched on liquid air/cryogenic energy storage: it's scales extremely well, is cheap, and environmentally friendly, while relying on very well-founded technology, and no special materials.

However, you misspresented the \"waste\" it produces and how difficult it is to store it. Because it is infact radioactive. But even if it weren't there is an other almost condeming factor. Nuclear plants are not eternal. Yeah, that might not seem that big of a deal but the cost and difficulty of neutralizing a power plant and closing shop is immence. We don't currently have the technology to do that in a large scale. There are many \"expired\" plants around the world working in minimum production simply for the fact that we can't really turn them off as fast as we can build them. Moreover, the more a plant passes its expiration date the more dangerous it becomes. Therefore, i still think that nuclear could be the future especially if we target towards fusion (yeah pretty difficult). I really don't know how to combat climate change. I tend to believe there needs to be a major change in the ways we consume, commute and think about energy. Transportation by car needs to be replaced by better, cleaner and faster* ways of mass commute. Consumption needs to be reduced and fast fashion abolished. When energy production works in abundance in order to gain profits there will always be waste that could of have been avoided. Also i was disappointed you just scraped carbon capture which has great potential but needs help regulating. For instance, olivine can be used for capturing CO2 and produce aggragates to be used in building road and/or houses. Climate change cannot be avoided it needs to be fought. We can't trade fossil fuels for something else it simply cannot be done. Even if through seer mass production of solar panels we managed to fuel our energy needs through renewables the extruction needed for such an intevor especially in rare earth minerals that showcase ppb, or ppt concentrations would require MASSIVE amount of fossil fuels.

{"cid": "Ugxmei_Bp8atbgJOLO14AaABAg", "text": "I will start with saying that this is a very good video, sumarising the history and evolution of the situation, making it clearer and understandable, and I agree with almost all it. I do, however, find that the simplifying process has left a few missrepresentation issues and, while I am sure you are aware of them, I'd like to address them nonetheless. \nWhile I do think nuclear power is demonized and missused, there are problems with it being THE solution to cleaner energy. The main one being that a nuclear power plant is always working with the same output, it does not alter its output, like a burning fuel one could. Meaning you cannot respond to different energy needs, peaks and so, without hugely overproducing. Of course, maybe we will have a way to store the excess energy, but as you said, this is more about what we can do now, and that tecnology may come, if ever, quite far into the future. Increased se of nuclear, however, could lead to enhanced innovation and research on it which can be an avenue to untold solutions, so not disagreeing with the need to capitalize on it.\nThe Carbon Trading is also quite missrepresented. I understand that you are addressing the core concept, but is called the \"cap and trade\" system: you can establish different emission limits for different countries, industries and even companies, the difficulty is on setting those limits. It has MANY problems, and its application so far has been plagued by misscalculations, overestimations due to lobbying and political preasure, as well as an overall lack of ambition. It has shown some progress recently in EU, however, recently, but the truth is that this \"inetrnalisation\" of emissions may always require someone to need to produce emissions and that kinda compromises it in the long run.\nI'll also say that the simplification of Biomass energy is... understandable, and not technically incorrect, but runs teh risk of making a less informed individual that's all tehre is to it. While its current use and potential is minimal, the use of bio-energy (and I understand that you were probably working with a limited scope of the \"biomass\" term) can have some future. Biodiesel, while controversial for teh use of crops, works fine as a fuel substitute, and further research into what are called \"third generation bio-fuels\" can lead to ways to use vegetation or biological waste to produce fuel. There's more to it than just \"burning wood\". I do understand the simplification for the sake of time and because relying on this potential solution while tackling the current crisis is pretty much delusional right now.\nSorry for the long comment, if anyone reads it.

Increasingly extreme weather (stronger hurricanes, more frequent and longer lasting drougt etc. but also more extreme and longer lasting cold snaps/heat waves requiring more extensive use of heating/air conditioning respectively) are already costing governments and individuals around the world loads of money, which, if mitigated (partially via nuclear) is an indirect ROI for alternative (to fossil fuel) energy sources. Naturally, I don't know whether that would nullify the extra cost or whether there are more factors to consider that make nuclear more or less expensive (although I'd bet there are). I'd really like to see a proper study on this (an economic/climate science study that puts an estimated $ amount on the savings from greenhouse gasses not emitted), although the link might be too indirect for anything conclusive. Even disregarding all this, as countries start building more nuclear power plants and giving out subsidies for them, innovation is likely to come in and drive costs down quite a bit.

In displaying the graph on temperate and CO2 levels during ice ages, Gore makes the claim that the strongest CORRELATION in the data is temperature and CO2. When I showed this clip to seniors in high school, they all said this established that  the rise CO2 levels CAUSED the rise in temperature. But correlation does  not establish causation. What Gore does not point out is that on his graph temperature increase PRECEDES the rise in CO2 by several hundred years. This is NOT to say that CO2 levels affect temperature, but it does say the current situation is not the same.\n\nAt the end of this film, Gore show a graph that seems to indicate that employing certain measures will cause CO2 levels to slow and eventually drop. But the Y axis in this graph is not levels of CO2 but GIC - Growth in CO2 levels. Thus if we take all of the measures Gore recommends, we will slow the increase in CO2 levels but not stop or reverse them.

He uses the, age old trick at the beginning of linking pollution as the same thing. CO2 in the atmosphere isn't pollution. It's an increase of a natural process. While it isn't a good thing it's very much more complicated than simply reducing CO2 emissions. That, I'm afraid, isn't realistic. It's going to take a massive reduction in energy use. Ban social media. That'll help. But that isn't going to happen either. Nuclear. Brilliant. But wait a moment. It's very, very expensive. And it's total bollocks that there's very little waste.

Life may survive but it would be pretty apocalyptic. I understand this is tangential but I think it's a good proof of concept that at a moment's notice, we could do this.\n\nSecondly. I'll try to convince you that our effects are pretty significant.\nIt is known that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, I.e. that its presence in the atmosphere traps heat. While I agree that any 1 coal fire power station isn't gonna alter the earths climate, consider that we have been pumping this greenhouse into the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and a large amount of it stays in the atmosphere. Every coal fire power station, every petrol diesel and gas car, etc. for as long as they have been around all contributing to this one this, even without seeing the calculations, it's intuitively gonna have some major effects.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Air Quality, with regards to pollution, is not related to CO2 and climate change. CO2 isn't toxic for humans, the issues are with its heat-trapping properties. Air pollution, while an important issue, is distinct from climate change.\n- Climate change may not literally end the earth, I'm assuming that's what you meant by \"biosphere ending super civilization\", but mass extinctions aren't fun and crap tonnes of consequential human death isn't fun, our civilization may survive but I'd rather life not be super unpleasant in future.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "David Capes", "channel": "UCHxPVFDqOK-w0ULLwULOkUQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQMHsGrudKdm2TO6afKIywtP2zw59NMxQSfdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Besides, why should we dictate which direction the climate is heading in?

{"cid": "UgxMKi6yxRHhOBINSKd4AaABAg", "text": "Hey, I studied physics, did a huge project on this stuff, and now I'm getting my master's in energy engineering. Here on my thoughts on what you said:\n\n- A big criticism of Al Gore's movie is that Al Gore and his father come from big fossil fuel money. He is a bit hypocritical. Ya know who else comes from fossil fuel money? Gavin Newsom and former governors of CA Jerry Brown and his dad, Pat Brown. The Browns were able to prevent nuclear plants from being built in the state. Now Diablo Canyon is the only one left, and CA's emissions are not looking great. They also created a monopoly for Indonesian oil in CA. Jerry appointed Getty family trust administrator, William Newsom, to the state appeals court. Newsom was able to keep taxes low for oil. Now his son is in office as governor. Something to think about...\n\n- Cap-and-trade and Emissions Trade Schemes (ETS) and carbon taxes have been proven not to work. They only hurt the everyday man, not the corporations they were aimed at, b/c the people end up paying higher prices and taxes. Take Europe, which has an ETS, it's facing an energy crisis and has been for some time. Europe is seeing more deaths b/c people cannot sufficiently heat their homes.\n\n- No, developing nations are not \"allowed to build coal plants.\" First, it depends on the country's resources. Second, when the US and Britain industrialized, we did not have the UN and the World Bank controlling our resources. Intl orgs control the resources in developing nations, effectively holding them back, so they don't make the same \"mistakes\" as the industrialized nations. Environmental and conservation groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club also have a long list of preventing the construction of plants and dams that could provide power to entire nations b/c they don't want to disrupt the ecosystems or they want the natl parks for tourists. In fact, the very existence of natl parks in many African countries hurts the people: they take away from their farmland, and thus, they impede on the people's ability to grow enough food for themselves and develop.\n\n- The Green New Deal, AOC, Greta Thunberg, Bernie Sanders are explicitly anti-nuclear. They push and push for solar and wind, but that kind of energy will put us as modern nations back. Bernie Sanders had a nuclear plant in VT shut down, promising a 25% reduction in emissions, but the state had to rely on fossil-fueled energy from neighboring states and emissions rose 16%.\n\n- Nations shift energies in a very clear pattern: biomass, coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear. It is unfair and impractical to force developing nations to leapfrog to renewable energy. Nuclear is the only clear solution, but so is allowing developing nations to industrialize free from the restrictions we, developed nations, have placed on them.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jessie", "channel": "UCn01kP7BiTqaNZedq0xyMhQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRsx5eXxrfGK6V7ukttmyW5A7S_wXbbvgyA1z5pug=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I wish people took this topic more seriously and didn't let the media/political figures distort the truth. I have been saying that nuclear is the way to go for a while now, and when we can create nuclear power plants which run on fusion rather than fission it will be much more effective than it already is. By then I hope mankind would have largely transitioned to cleaner energy sources if not entirely to result in a net-zero CO2 emission level. I still think that we should embrace other forms of clean energy like solar, wind, hydroelectric and so on because, while they may not always be practical for large scale energy production, they can be on small scales. In the case of solar panels, as I believe you stated in the video, they are becoming more efficient with time. At the end of the day we need to take care of the planet, and the life on it which we have a responsibility to protect. I always put a massive amount of emphasis on that point. Mankind is negatively impacting the environments for countless species. The great coral reef is nearly gone due to ocean acidification, and we are cutting down the rainforest displacing or killing off potential undisciplined species of animals and plants.

{"cid": "UgwgBU_6vWKm6Uipn0l4AaABAg", "text": "Gotta be honest, you almost lost me at the beginning, but I do wholeheartedly support your conclusions. You didn't pull any punches when talking about nuclear, coal, wind, or solar, and while you did underplay just how big a step up natural gas is from coal (I mean, even petroleum products are a massive step up from coal, it's not a hard thing to top), you clearly understand the most important things about this debate. As an engineer, I can wholeheartedly support your message.\n\nAll that said I have serious reservations about climate science (whether we call it global warming or climate change), because while it is happening there are heaps of money being used by unscrupulous actors to influence the science. 'Carbon colonialism' isn't just an international thing, big companies in the US have a far easier time meeting emissions standards than small ones, and can effectively choke out competition by lobbying for more stringent regulations. Climate alarmism helps big businesses to get these standards passed, and not coincidentally many of these studies are sponsored by large companies. Combine this obvious money trail with the wildly disparate figures from so many of these studies, and I think it's fair to be skeptical.\n\nYou also have a very Eurocentric and deterministic view of industrialization, one that simply put does not conform to reality. Modern developing countries do not need to go through the same industrial revolution that the US and Europe did, because they have access to a far greater base of knowledge and technology that we did during our industrial revolution. More importantly, that's not what they're doing anyways. China and India aren't polluting to provide for the needs of their people, they're doing it to provide low cost consumer goods to Europe and the US. They won't stop ramping up production when their pollution level allows them to reach western standards of living, they'll stop when the demand in western countries for cheap goods is met.\n\nThis is actually the most insidious part of the 'carbon colonialism' you mentioned. People in China and India are suffering from the environmental and health effects of shouldering what would normally be OUR pollution, and the wealth generated from all this pollution remains mostly concentrated in the hands of the wealthy elite. I'm sure you don't support trickle down economics, so why you seem to think the best way to help the lower classes in China and India is to allow their corporations to pollute more so they can make more money is beyond me. Fact is that those carbon emissions are killing them in droves, and you should be just as worried about them polluting over there for their sake as you are about it for ours.\n\n\nGood video, but you're missing some major parts of the puzzle.

And not because the tecnology didnt exist, but because plants were build to be profitable. Depending on the type of reactor, you can actually get very little waste, but the first reactors were of the Light Water type. Simpler to build, they produced a lot of waste, and containment tecnology was not strong enough yet to withstand the Helium gas pressure from rupturing containers (when spent fuel decays it produces helium nucleai, which over a time produce enough gas pressure to fracture concrete)\n\nLuckily now that's not a worry, but you have to understand, during the cold war and before the economic boom of the 90s, the US was not into building sustainable stuff. Back in the day, it was a reasonable fear. Over time, third and 4th generation reactors can feed from that waste, so now containment is not an issue either.\n\nRegarding proliferation... well, diplomacy is key, indeed. Treaties, international banking and prestige are tools that help keeping agreements from collapsing. Trump kinda doesnt help to that point.

{"cid": "UgyhP0I9eWMYAsO7D5J4AaABAg", "text": "Thanks, for another great, informative  and thought provoking video! There are some problems with nuclear that didn't get mentioned, such as proliferation. Uranium enrichment is a process that increases the relative amount of U-235 isotope that is useful in the fission process, however this same process can be used to create weapons grade material. An intentional attack using nuclear weapons is a scary thought which I think can put some people off the idea.\n\n Unfortunately, I believe some would take advantage and play on those fears for their own agenda and the threat can be exaggerated (eg check out John Oliver, Iran Deal). Weapons grade uranium must be enriched to a much higher level (>90% instead of 3-20%) which is a significant difference, international enrichment facilities can be used to supply fuel to nation states without allowing them access to the enrichment technology and since you were talking mainly about US climate policy and the US already has plenty of nukes, there's not as much of an argument here against more nuclear plants in the US.\n\n Another issue with nuclear power is the waste material, it is, in ways, much more hazardous than green house gases. Atmospheric CO2 levels have a bit to go before it become harmful for humans to breathe, but touching or just being near radioactive material can cause radiation sickness. Of course this ignores the larger impact of heightened CO2 levels in the atmosphere such as rising tides / displaced residents / fish etc, but where CO2 can be reduced from the atmosphere with forestation efforts, a small, but arguably significant, amount (~3%) of waste is deemed High Level Waste, and needs to be disposed underground for thousands of years.\n\n This is a very small amount by volume when bearing in mind nuclear already has a brilliantly low waste output rate, and, when handled properly with modern technology and effective storage and disposal techniques, the risk is substantially mitigated to the point that it is, as you say, significantly less dangerous that other forms of power generation. It is also true that other industries create dangerous pollutants that can last indefinitely such as cadmium and mercury.\n\n I think it definitely seems like Nuclear would be great for buying us a bunch more time at least, which is what we desperately need right now, but I'd be interested if anyone had any thoughts on these talking points and whether they hold water?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jeremy Surgenor", "channel": "UCyJgNITF1RNL_5zsD-_byOg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCyHki-a2Rm1Mvi8a5Z5__n2cuIqOUULXi4wgO=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxD9lYPGUKLOApq0Y94AaABAg", "text": "I would like to see an expanded discussion of nuclear power as a solution to decarbonizing the American electricity grid. We should discuss the history and safety record of nuclear power. We should discuss the accidents that have happened and how passive cooling in modern reactor design addresses these scenarios. I’d like to specifically see explore the most immediate designs that are closest to being ready for rapid scaled deployment. One of these is the NuScale power module. We should talk about how many of these we need (I recon we need about 5500 NSPM units to replace fossil fuel). How many days would it take to manufacture these? What if the NRC granted site licenses to all existing coal and natural gas plants to convert the plant to use a NSPM? Could the existing electric generators be re-used? After all they merely turn steam into electricity. Why not just provide the steam in a different way?\n\nSome in the pro-nuclear camp favor switching to Thorium. While I agree that continuing to research Thorium is a good idea, you underestimate the research necessary to bring Thorium reactors to market. Uranium plants already exist and are already plenty safe. Let’s deploy Uranium SMRs now. Thorium may catch up and be a better solution someday (and ultimately may be more profitable to operate) but we need to solve climate change now. Modern SMR designs are plenty safe. \n\nThe main objections I hear about nuclear are:\n\n1. We don’t need it (because solar is getting cheaper). \nThis is false because you are talking about subsidized solar that is unreliable. The electricity is coming from natural gas a lot of the time. \n\n2. It is too expensive. \nThe only form of electricity that is actually cheaper when not subsidized is natural gas from fracking. And even that is only true because you allow the waste to go into the atmosphere. To compare this fairly you need to add in the cost of climate change to the cost of natural gas, plus the other environmental costs from fracking. \n\n3. We don’t have a way to dispose of the waste. \nAgain, this is both not really true AND holds nuclear to a higher standard than most other electricity sources AND overstates the problem of nuclear waste. Nuclear waste in this context is used fuel assemblies. After they have been cooled, They go into dry cask storage. We aren’t anywhere close to running out of space for them. The amount of material is tiny compared to waste from any other source except hydroelectric and it is contained. Second, there are many uses for this material such as reprocessing, or using it as fuel in an IFR reactor. \n\n4. Fear of accidents\nThe accidents that have happened in the west (Fukushima and Three Mile Island) are both addressed with passive cooling designs. Total fatalities in those two accidents: zero. Are there other accidents that could happen? Sure. But there are accidents that happen with any form of energy including wind and solar. I suggest you compare the deaths likely to be caused by nuclear energy to the deaths likely to be caused by climate change. It’s no contest that nuclear is preferable. \n\nWe need to do use nuclear to decarbonize the electric grid right away so that we move onto the other challenges - what I would call the second tier of challenges. We produce a lot of carbon and green house gases from things besides making electricity. Electricity is just the biggest source. The second one is cars. After that comes cargo ships, home heating oil, jet planes, and industrial heat (like in blast furnaces). And if we stop using oil, we will stop having cheap plastic and we need to find sustainable substitutes for plastic in any case. Like I said. Lots more issues once we solve the grid. We need to go with a solution for the grid we KNOW will work - not spend the money on pie in the sky crap that will leave us reliant on natural gas.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Xxx Yyy", "channel": "UChS63mWPC34aAswqT0D7AgA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTsVlKcH--FAlojKPOJZO-aPDauW677P56uKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This does nothing to help anyone.\n\nLike most issues, a large majority of people who are deniers/skeptics are normal people like you and me and have the opinion because of gradual influences from the Internet, TV, and media in general, or because it’s what their friends think (who were influenced by the media themselves). \n\nPeople become more and more echo chambery and hostile to new opinions because of the insults thrown around casually. If someone or some group constantly insulted you for liking X over Y, you’re ingrained to dislike anything they say, especially related to Y.\n\nIt’s a self fulfilling prophecy where the initial few people start calling the other side stupid, then the other side responds that you need a high IQ to be in line with their ideology, and it goes on and on and on. *The initial drops of toxicity evolves into a two-way tsunami*.\n\nLook at the current US political climate. It’s almost impossible to do actual research on President A’s opinion on regulating the kitty litter industry or that rumor that Governor B secretly supports increasing the budget for state-drawn cartoon pron. Everything is completely toxic and sensationalized.\n\nThe only proven working way to even attempt to fight mass misinformation, is to tell them (without insulting them directly) that they are incorrect and presenting the facts from a verified, reputable source and explaining the reasons of it. This is how the CDC is dealing with the “Backstreet Boys Reunion Tour” misinformation right now.\n\nTLDR: Insulting people who oppose your opinion hurts your argument to them.

So what happens when the economy of China improves, the poor farmer becomes middle class and wants the same level of comfort and luxury as western people?\n\nDo you see the issue now? Even with the same number of people on earth, if everyone adopts a western lifestyle (food, travel, comfort, transportation, etc) there would not be enough resources on earth to sustainably satisfy this demand.\nAnd you can't tell other people to live in their huts or shouldn't improve their living standards (with the associated increase in energy and resource consumption).

I'm not an expert, but I generally have a good understanding of most American federal policies that affect the energy sector. The explanation of the cap and trade system is quite terrible in this video. For example, the cap and trade system actually did cause a net reduction in pollution. The video overlooked that the amount of caps in the market were actually reduced annually. This meant that the total amount of pollution companies could commit did decrease and the amount of cap tradeable were limited. This also caused the caps to gain a price as determined by the markets supply and demand interaction. This price meant that high polluters would see a reduction in profits (from buying caps), while low polluters would see an increase in profit (from selling caps). This incentives companies to find methods to reduce pollution and the incentive increases as the supply of caps reduces causing higher cap prices. Also, the system gave low polluters extra funds which they could hopefully use to further pollution reduction methods. All without the introduction of any new taxes. However, the system didn't feel strong for many environmentalist which caused them to not support, reform, or protect it, while corporatist were lobbied into trying to sabotage the programming by messing with the planned cap supply reductions.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ghost Lobster", "channel": "UCPIyBZgi4-R6tFJiigLMl4w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQoIUflZWk5MbIeV0LACNp98W5hOl2oN7JLtDVPLA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyXVN9fElG1o6hfCZ14AaABAg", "text": "Your argument shouldn't depend on subscribing to climate change. \n\nFirst you dismiss whatever percent the climate-deniers are, then argue that the U.S. has succeeded in previous clear objectives, and despite efforts to undermine this agenda, climate change is real so we need to. \n\nIt starts out conceding that the \"deniers\" are a lost cause, spend 80% of the video persuading people who already agree and only then do you spring upon them the N word (which I'd first been annoyed that you might scoff at nuclear, then 2/3 through began hoping you would and 3/4ths was relieved that I knew you had to support nuclear). \n\nBut WHY spend so much time on the things you don't have to persuade them on, so little on the part so many people are irrational about (nuclear). And accept as foregone conclusion that everyone who's a conservative rejects climate change. (Hint: Many have come around, they just don't think it's practical WITHOUT nuclear now). \n\nTo that point, you also bifurcated between a \"FACT or a THEORY' as though a theory graduates to become a fact or vice versa. There's no path for either to become the other. A Theory is the highest status for claims, as it's comprised of facts which yield explanatory statements to describe all the evidence. I.e. The... Theory of Evolution..? Another frustration of mine is when people treat the term Theory as though it's a pejorative in opposition to a claim's veracity when it's the exact opposite.\n\nIn fact, IF we actually had a THEORY to describe the FACT of Global Warming ....in the same way that we have a Theory (called Natural Selection in this case..?) to describe the FACT of Evolution (that organisms change over time and those changes accumulate) ... the 'deniers' would be unable to. Achieving the exalted status of Theory would have provide attributes as yet lacking in GW or Climate Change which would allow predictions. When you can predict things it's impossible to refute them. The only reason Evolution fails to persuade them is because it's in direct conflict with their religious tenants and bc Evolution involves retrodiction, not prediction. Or at least not in the way Religious people would want ... (like telling them which species something will become).\n\nFEATURES OF A SCIENTIFIC THEORY: \n- Explanatory statement that fit ALL of the evidence\n- No extraneous parts.\n- Falsifiable statements (see: Carl Popper & Falsification // Testability)\n- Tendency towards Parsimony- Enable hi-fidelity Predictions.\n\nSpecifically, Climate Science lacks the clarity to be FALSIFIABLE, as they have no model WHATSOEVER describing the changes we can expect without being wrong thus far by massive margins. All validation attempts with models have been wildly ridiculous. (Look in to Bayesian Statistical Models for Climate Predictions). \n\nTo be a theory, you'd be able to make PREDICTIONS which have error margins that are quantifiable without being laughable. Accurate predictions makes denying very difficult. Take evolution: The Religious Right rejects it bc it rejects deep time (ostensibly). As they appear to accept change (like antibiotics which stop working, which cannot be refuted) the most basic meaning of evolution, change over time. But they reject sufficient time for the kinds of changes and argue it could only have been the Still-Deistic-Process ... directed change. But in fact, we can predict the evolutionary developmental stage of earlier // basal species would be at, proportionate to the age strata the fossils are located. And because all sciences are INTEGRATED ... they'll totally coincide with one another without either having collaborated (as the religious would likely argue).\n\nWhile Religious-based skeptics or deniers don't know those words? This level of proof and accuracy are what we're accustomed to when something is demonstrably (scientifically) true. And subconsciously, people appear to recognize when it's lacking.\n\nBut that doesn't matter; because Nuclear is so good, that no one should have to prove climate science to justify that transition. \n\nIt's lawsuits which presently make Civilian Reactors such a risky endeavor. If those potential suits could be preemptively resolved say, via a case before SCOTUS -- maybe the primary risk (10 year lawsuits delaying multi-billion-dollar investments and the interest associated which eventually forces them to declare bankruptcy, and completely foregoing the opportunities due to that very uncertainty) could be mitigated before ever needing to decide the interest rates. \nMaybe talk about U.S. and Global death rates from each source of energy, and also focus on the practical application problems of Solar ... or mention that Solar really is just Nuclear, and if they want it, they want Nuclear. Same with Geo-Thermal. \n\nUse those unfalsifiable arguments of Climate Change for the Left (irrespective whether it's a dogmatic belief or eventually becomes a Theory). And ... use whatever rational or irrational argument the Right will respond to: Fiscal conservatism or capitalistic advantage ... there are MANY.

However, a greedy maniacal business man, who had a kerosene business, decided we should run engines with refined oil, because he had a lot of it, and kerosene lamps only used a little.

Its honestly laughable how dense some people are. In fact, a lot of the pro-solar and wind farm advertising done, is payed for by fossil fuel companies and their think tanks, because they KNOW that solar and wind can’t come even close to matching the power created by coal and nuclear.

Now if the 12 billion people are living in huts and growing their own food then their planetary impact is not as negative. But if 12 billion people expect to be traveling in cars, flying in planes and living in nice homes then the impact on the planet will be great. For one, people have to realize that the planet is running out of resources to make things. Sand has to be dredged from ocean because it is needed for construction. The idea of mining on asteroids comes from the reality we don't too many places on the planet left to mine. So the danger of overpopulation comes from the standard of living and also the very fact that humans needlessly violent and wasteful. The fact is the planet is a system.  And like all systems, it has its limits. Like we don't know the limitation of how much C02 gas we can put in the atmosphere before we overload the safety nets, we also do not know how many people the planet can rationally sustain.

They need to step their game up to match or even exceed our efforts seeing as they are the largest polluters by far.

And no it’s not partially man made, at this point humans undoubtedly the root cause of global warming, and in a few years it’ll be out of our hands as the greenhouse gasses stored away in the large amounts of ice and permafrost around the earth melt will lead to a cycle of perpetual heating until there is no more ice left.

Climate related deaths around the world have gotten lower not higher as a result of using more fossil fuels not less. Again, I ask any evidence to show that coffee beans being harder to grow is a direct result of climate change? And no, most climate scientists don’t think that humans will go extinct as a result of ongoing climate change. Most believe that we’ll have to adapt and we’ll suffer economically but, it will not be the end of the world for humans or most of its inhabitants. Most of the models used to predict what you talk about are just plain wrong and can barely predict the weather 5 years into the future let alone 100. According to Bjorne lomberg political scientist who worked with over 100 of the worlds top economists to find out what are the worlds top 200 problems, climate change wasn’t even in the top 5. It ranked at number 8. This idea of runaway greenhouse gas isn’t reality it’s fiction and fear mongering. Again, I say I’m not a denier or skeptic, climate change is real and is PARTIALLY a result of us dumping CO2 into the air.

Thanks man! your comment is so correct. Anyway: I believe the first one to object Nuclear Plants is not the people, it's fossil fuel industry. If human focuses on advancing nuclear knowledge, fossil fuel will be told as history. Also, the newer nuclear plants are made more expensive NOT because it's expensive by itself, but its safety measure is being beefed so so much that it's going more and more costly. If we are about to compare justly, Nuclear and renewables (esp. solar) , here is a tale: for 1MW of solar you need roughly 1Ha (depending heavily on the landscape). Imagine how many trees you need to cut to produce the same that of 2GW nuclear plants (who takes up maybe just a few hectares, again mostly for safety). With accidents like Chernobyl or Fukushima, we should not ban Nuclear plants, we need to fund more to Nuclear safety.

I mean modern day nuclear power plants in the western world are reasonably safe under normal circumstances that would be no problem. But if the world's only energy source would nuclear, you would need a crap ton of plants, let's just say like 500 only in Europe. Now modern day power networks are only capable of working above a frequency of 50 Megahertz. If it goes below that, every single generator in every single power plant in the network will break down. That means all those plants don't have any power anymore and need to be repaired, which takes about 6 Weeks on an average generator. Every nuclear power plant has a couple of diesel generators that mechanically turn on if the power goes off to provide electricity to the water pumps in the reactor. Now, if all of a sudden the network frequency goes below 50Mhz and all the 500 Nuclear plants in Europe have to run their diesel engines for six weeks there will be at least one out of 100 whose engines get cloaked up, they run out of fuel or just overheat. That will be 5 nuclear explosions in Europe (I'm referring to Europe because it has a community network so every plant in Europe is connected). Almost every nuclear plant lies next to a river so a huge part of Europe's water will be contaminated, the air will be full of Caesium, Strontium 90, all that good stuff, millions of deaths.

What if a future earthquake starts a chain reaction of the buried material? What if a foreign state or terrorist organisation in war with the US finds this site and detonates a bomb in there? These issues remain largely unsolved. The best bet I've seen so far is to use a Gen IV plant to burn the used fuel, however that still means end storage for at least a couple of hundred years. One option could  also be to melt the rods in volcanoes or send the waste to the sun, one rocket at a time. Perhaps this could even be accomplished with a pressurized air cannon mounted to the surface of the moon, or something like that.\n\nThe second is the cost.

Also climate change may be a real issue, but America is contributing effectively nothing globally, it is of course important to have things like dumping in the ocean or rivers be illegal (it already is) and massive destruction of the ozone layer. Global warming is almost certainly happening and is probably made far more severe by humans (I don’t say that with certainty because, i mean, look at the papers they are all used for political reasons, mostly just due to the fact that there is a political opinion in basically every direction) from what I can tell it has been sped up drastically by humans and our hydrocarbons. The current problem is that it is simply impossible for wind and solar to take the majority of the power production. The problem is solar requires a massive amount of batteries and solar panels, both requiring massive amounts of mining for lithium and other seriously environmentally harmful substances. Wind is simply too infrequent and unpredictable to be used on a large scale. Currently the best option is clearly nuclear fission. The end goal is clearly nuclear fusion, which will take a while, likely 40 years to be economically viable. Population will cap out at 9-11 billion, people start caring about the climate when their country hits about 5000 dollars in gdp per capita, in my opinion we simply do what we are doing, and move to nuclear fission, the developing countries will do the same, though by that time we will likely have fission. I appreciate that you actually talked about nuclear, politicians are against it because it scares people, but they are ridiculously safe. I am somewhat disappointed by your insults to those who don’t believe climate change, as someone who has read the literature it is all over the place, with wildly different conclusions study to study, what I could get out of it with reasonable certainty was that it isn’t something we need to end immediately but simply a problem we should strive to solve over time (30-70 years).

It takes less resources than cotton to grow, and works as a great carbon sync because of the speed at which it grows. Hemp cloth if produced the way we make cotton now would actually be a pretty decent step in the right direction, obviously it's not a replacement for all things, it makes a pretty rough fabric but in applications where rough fabric is fine like those jeans or whatever other article of clothing, car seats, rope. The primary reasons your hemp jeans are more expensive is it takes a permitting process to set up a hemp farm and you get none of the subsidies like corn or cotton.\n\nTo add to the cotton thing being able to function as a replacement for other plant based industries can offset the costs dramatically. Yes it can make good cooking oil, cooking oils are the primary reason we grow rapeseed, another reason for rapeseed is biodiesel something else hemp oils can be used to produce, and it doesn't require engine modification.

Hemp pulp can be used to create paper in the same way wood pulp is, and it's properties actually lead to stronger paper, think not only office paper but shopping bags and the like.

And if some people wanna smoke its spicier cousin, whatever, who honestly cares, I'm sure even the pot farms could produce some of the other stuff as a byproduct of their main operation.

Lets get back into the mud-huts, then?\n\nIf you either ask the people in the rich cultures to reduce their living standards, use less light, warmth, mobility, internet ect - or ask the billions in developing nations to never raise theirs, you might find that hard to do. \nNobody likes to give up things that make life more bearable - or have no hope to better theirs.\nWithout massively repressive-non-democratic governance I´m pretty sure that will be wholly unfeasible.\n\nWhich leaves wastage reduction.\nWhich is already done widely , think of smaller cars at lower speeds, more efficient heating systems, low-energy lighting systems, better isolated living quarters ect. \nThere is still a lot of waste going on, and a lot of  that can be cut by upgrading infrastructure. \nBut in the end waste is not that big a number of the whole need.\n\nAnd all said and done - it will not be possibel to reduce or freeze energy usage for the foreseable future. \nAs long as people freeze, starve, or miss any other essentials, the use of power will rise. Because people want to live better than they are.\nNot to mention we get more and more people, a progression that might slow down within the next 30-50 years, but not for now.\n\nSo, energy use will rise. \nWether you and me, sitting in a warm, light  room in front of running computer, like it or not.\nIs it possible to raise the living standard of billions without energy expendage? Hardly.\nWe might have ways to raise them less wasteful than the west did in the last 100 years, but people moving, living, hospitals running, information networks expanding , all that needs power.\n\nBut I´m not that worried there.\nThe amount of energy hitting earth from the sun alone is enourmous, and not even a thousandth of a percent oft that is utilized in power production for now.\nThere is geothermic power production, in the longer run we can go to solar sattelites.\nMaybe a safe and clean variant of fission will come along extending the potential even further.\n\nYou basically asking \"where does it end\" is about as sensible as people claiming that gays marrying will lead to a slip-and slide so in the future there will be people marrying  five dogs.\n\nEnergy use will stagnate at the earliest when we reach post-scarcety in essential living conditions for all of humanity, not before. And that goal is reacheable by renewable means, no problem.\nBut that is so far from where we are now, and there is so extremely much energy availeable to harvest, that its really not important for now.\nFor now, making sure that growth in energy production is as low-impact as possible is the thing to do. \nNot preemptively thinking about \"wehere will it end\". That always only leads to \"those people\" who are poor now should not get a better deal.\n\nThere is exactly one hard limit to power consumption, which is how much energy  the earth surface can dissipate via infrared radiation.\nBut that number is so far away we dont really need to think about it now. \nMaybe the 500 billion people living here in 3000 years will have to confront that problem, but not us.\n\nFor now, we have means to get everybody on this planet fed, warm and mobile, we just have to choose the means that wont ruin the liveability of the planet.", "time": "5 months ago (edited)", "author": "Niles Butler", "channel": "UCPN8DEi6dF90Em5nPR7F84Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx-Oftzo1SYTw-7T6OfXmz00cAN_XC6Jm_bQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Black lung and similar respiratory ailments are not the result of radioactivity.  Black lung, specifically, results when tiny particles of coal dust lodge deep in a person's lungs and cause an inflammatory reaction.  Basically, certain white blood cells can't remove the particles, so the particles are engulfed in place to keep them separate.  This results in scar tissue formation (fibrosis) and the loss of lung capacity.  In severe and progressive cases, lung tissue actually dies and breaks apart (necrosis).\n\nAgain, radioactivity is something else completely!\n\nYou may be mixing up coal dust and black lung with issues surrounding coal ash.  Like every other mined product, there are trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioactive elements mixed in with coal.  When the coal is burned, these elements remain in the leftover waste, called coal ash.  After long enough, this can build up, but it's generally less of an issue than the coal ash waste itself, which is challenging to store and dispose of.  Energy companies have done an absolutely terrible job of keeping coal ash from polluting both ground and surface waters in my state, North Carolina.

{"cid": "UgyddcRObRrHrzax1_F4AaABAg", "text": "So what we have here is 25 minutes of pontificating on regulations and government cram-downs and authoritarian attempts to compel this or that action or action cessation. 25 minutes of science says this and science says that. 25 minutes of some government got together to impose cram downs and regulation, then they didn't and then some other governments got together and said they would do some things then they didn't. You know what's missing? PEOPLE. Why is this important? Because if PEOPLE make better choices, then it doesn't matter what governments do or what businesses want.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter how much corporations twirl their mustaches plotting how they can rape the environment and steal and cheat ... if PEOPLE just don't buy products they produce. If PEOPLE don't buy those products, then no mater how much they want to rape the environment for profit, they can't if there is no profit to be obtained when people don't buy such products. Problem solved, no need to force business to do or not do things by force, nor to convince government to cram down such edicts. No need to convince governments to deny people the ability to buy products they want nor compel people to buy products they don't want. Wouldn't it be better if PEOPLE made better choices than trying to force them do do as you wish?\r\n\r\nAnd, not only that, what do you call it when people want something they are not being provided? A PROFIT opportunity. If PEOPLE WANT products that are environmentally friendly, then businesses will do THAT because there is a PROFIT opportunity to do THAT instead. Think about it - when you need people to CHOOSE to buy your product, what are you going to produce? A product people will want to choose? or a product they would not like? And this goes to the real problem. Why do businesses \"want to rape the environment for profit\"? Because that's what PEOPLE want. People want CHEAP products not expensive products, however that happens. So when people want CHEAP MORE than they want clean, what would you expect businesses to do, especially when those two things are at odds? If PEOPLE put a preference on environmentally friendly over cost, what do you think businesses would do?\r\n\r\nThe point here is that to deal with the problem STOP obsessing over what is NOT the problem and focus on what CAUSES the problem, That is businesses for the former and PEOPLE for the latter. I know, people want to blame something else, it's not PC to put the blame on the PEOPLE. But just like you say people need to accept the truth about climate change - well, I say you have to accept what is actually the motivating force driving that problem. It you refuse to admit that motive force, you are going to have a tough time solving the problem. Witness, the heretofore inability to get much accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe problem is some people trying to convince other people in government to impose cram downs on other people to compel them to do or to not to do this or that. Wouldn't it be better to try to convince those people to make better choices? To have different values? Then you wouldn't have to try herding cats of government to do your authoritarian bidding. It wouldn't even matter.\r\n\r\nBut here's the good news. Just look at the popularity of the Prius, for example. Why is it that Toyota makes it in such high volume and variations and now pretty much all makers have at least one hybrid offering if not a number and also EVs? Why is Tesla so popular and has a market cap greater than GM and Ford combined? Is it because of regulatory cram down? No, it's because PEOPLE WANT them and are willing to pay the premium to get them. Why is it that people are proactively replacing light bulbs with LED bulbs? PEOPLE WANT them and are willing to pay the premium to get them. Why are hundreds of billions of dollars being invested on developing green tech and EVs? Because there is a profit opportunity for that because PEOPLE WANT it and are willing to pay for. And, more good news - turns out a lot of those investors and business creators are doing all for that is because, are you ready for this, they BELIEVE in the principle of green tech and products.\r\n\r\nMaybe results would be better if people tried convincing PEOPLE to make better choices that trying to convince government to cram down on people. Just a thought. I know it's not as much fun and satisfying for virtue signaling and authoritarian statist cramming down on \"businesses\" (which means actually cramming down on people as described above.) It's a lot more effective and efficient if people want what you would like them to want rather than trying to force people to accept what you want to force them to accept but do not want.\n\n\nAnd yes, nuclear.

If it is it's only weakly so. EPA and other agencies say it is not, and that's where the preponderance of evidence still points. Miles Power did a good video series on the topic. Because it was from a couple years ago it misses some significant recent studies, but it's still essentially sound.\n\nIt's important to remember that organic herbicides and pesticides are often as bad or worse than conventional alternatives. Also, their use can lead to lower yields, which means more water and land use for agriculture and even less for ecosystems. (Human water use restrictions tend to make headlines, but the other story is birds are truly fd by the time lake Mead is drying up.)\n\nMany pests are also hazardous to human health. And pests and \"weeds\" can be a complete disaster for the environment (when concentrated through human activities like farming).\n\nObviously it's a tangle of issues and I haven't even mentioned GMOs.  There are those who have been pushing agricultural chemicals with all the criminal indifference of the drug companies that caused the opioid crisis. But just as the right reaction in that case was not to ban all opioid medications, the right one in this case is not to demand a return to pre-modern farming.\n\nYou can't cut the knot with ideological reflex responses. We have to take it case by case, just like a good doctor in prescribing medications. Almost all drugs are capable of causing serious harm when used incorrectly, but the potential benefits are often remarkable.

Most plans like the Environmental Defense Fund's set Carbon emissions at a goal and then from there you can trade them. The first major issue with this is that it stymies innovation for cleaner practices because once you buy up enough credits there is no reason to change your practices. Another issue with this is that you generate increasing inequalities and a concentration of pollution that would be harmful socially and to local environments. Much akin to the issues with the EDF's tradable quota system for fisheries in Iceland. So although cap and trade is not ideal it is not necessarily quite as bad as you make it sound here. What you describe is actually a lot like the original plan for the Kyoto proticol where Ukraine traded its credits to Japan and the countries actually saw a net increase in pollution because under-developed countries were allocated an excess allowance in the interests of allowing future development but they traded them and so the developed big polluters were allowed to increase their pollution while the poor countries polluted in similar amounts.

The implication is that the per capita emissions \"cap\" would fall below the current average per capita emissions and optimistically as low as the carbon neutral threshold.

It's supposed to efficiently allocate carbon credits to those who can best use them.  Some industries just fundamentally need to produce more carbon than others, at least in the short term.  So this would allow these industries to stay afloat while still incentivizing them to innovate and reduce emissions to avoid paying for carbon credits.\n\nAlso carbon taxes which function similarly to cap and trade but lean more on incentives than mandates at least deserves a mention.  Especially since taxes are typically more efficient than subsidies.  There's plenty of alternatives and mediations and figuring out which to subsidize is a tricky dilemma.

No, I don’t imagine that you are – familiar, acquainted, aware, knowing, discerning. You are patient. But, what are you going to do?… a small scene was set – a figure, perhaps a hand, or a small space, an emotion of sorts, a leaning towards something? I tried. I tried to play. Maybe – if you’ll allow? – I could instruct you, give a narrative, at least some closure. It wasn’t going to last after all – I’m sure you could tell…? Just words, just that atmosphere – only enough to reach around, it could be compacted down into just a small box…. Weary. I finish. You are weary too.

Veteran's Affairs are part of the cost of having a military and many other nations include veteran's benefits in their defense spending, so it can be sensible to include it (but it should be noted that it is included, to avoid misunderstandings). Further, research, production, and maintenance of US nuclear weapons and nuclear power for aircraft carriers and submarines is housed under the Department of Energy, not DoD, so there is another ~$24 billion in that program. It's debatable whether or not that should be included, but in my opinion it should be. And finally, we have the Coast Guard. Which is technically a branch of the armed forces, but its budget comes out of Homeland Security and not the DoD, so its ~$11 billion could be added too. If you include all of those other items, you're at $983 billion or 76% or the 1.3 trillion.

I don't consider myself a \"denier\", and \"skeptic\" doesn't truly cover my position on the matter. More aptly, I'd consider myself a \"pragmatist\" who's mostly just \"skeptical\" of proposed and popular solutions to the problem. Wind, solar, and hydro all garner a fair amount of popular support but without much consideration for the complete picture. To use a related comparison, electric vehicles fall into a similar category with most people only considering the daily emissions of them without taking into consideration the lifetime emissions of the vehicle. While they run cleaner, they have heavier costs up front and at end of life, as such it takes several years for it to become a net benefit. That might still sound worth it, but it's usually going to be better to continue using whatever your current vehicle is longer rather than replacing it. If it's actually time to get a new vehicle (and not just you want a new one) an EV is a fair consideration but as with most technology, it's best to hold off on upgrades until required. By doing such, you reduce overall waste, both on production and disposal, and benefit from the additional advancements that will take place given the additional time. In this regard, between us being aware of the problem and seeking more efficient forms of energy (as we have been for hundreds of years) our advancement will continue in the direction we want, even if not necessarily at quite the desired accelerated pace.

I'm guessing you only included U-235 in your estimate, however it only makes up 0.7% of Uranium on earth.

If you ignore seawater extraction, we could get several hundred years of 100% energy reliance on nuclear fission. But no one is advocating 100% reliance.

{"cid": "UgysGhDIf9wNRdy0CQ54AaABAg.98AsdARHWyO9JJp-CaKvMr", "text": " @Jakob Schulze  very late to this discussion but this is completely incorrect. Along with your other comments. Currently we only use (USA) about 20% of the energy in uranium rods, and even then they last 1 to 2 years. Nuclear energy has a ridiculously high up front short term cost of building the plant, but afterward the price of the electricity is pennies as compared to any other source of power.in the US at least, nuclear plants cost a fortune, in part due to politicians and lobbyist trying to shit them down. The last nuclear plant built in the US I believe, was from 1970 something and finished in about 2017. Politics plays a huge part of the problem with nuclear. Get rid of the useless regulations and costs would shrink dramatically. Obv keep the necessary regulations. OK wind and solar time! Wind is really only useful off shore, it tanks local housing prices that fall in its shadows, and they're super expensive to repair when they break, which they do often. Solar is the most bull shit thing of them all. Everyone points out the toxic waste produced by nuclear as a huge problem, which it's really not, but seems to forget that solar panels are created with toxic materials! I've read two conflicting articles, one from 2018 says we'll have 250,000 metric tons of TOXIC waste from solar panels by 2050, the other from 2020 says 78 million metric tons. By the way, currently we have no idea how to take care of that toxic waste because the materials that can be reused are way more expensive to get out than it's worth. Let's not forget the biggest problem with solar panels, there's on average only 12 hours of sunlight per day per year. Most places have clouds. Clouds = no power. Guess what has to over compensate in the event a cloud goes over some solar panels. You got it, your local plants have to produce more electricity just in case those solar panels stop producing! So how much good are they doing? When you add up all the problems and energy needed to create them ect ect, solar panels are pretty much only good in deserts. How do you get that power back to people. Good question, we don't. In the US there has been a hugeeee push for solar panels. They produce less than 1% of the electricity. That's really really really useless. To conclude my rant on a topic of passion of mine, the only future that exists where all humans can have electricity at the current exponential rate of increasing population, is with a fuck ton of nuclear. Renewables are cool theoretically, but really only hydro and geothermal are good. Solar is ass outside of deserts or something similar, and wind is only good off shore. Nuclear is the best and only green option, eventually hopefully we can do fusion, until then fission is the best option without any debate. Also should mention nuclear has less deaths attributed to it than any other source except for wind solar and hydroelectric. And don't give me but radiation... Bull shit, no one counts the co2 deaths from coal or petroleum or anything else, so that's not a valid argument. Go nuclear! Also, for fucks sake. Germany is literally building more coal plants because of Fukushima. On a different note, some dumbass decided that wood is a renewable source of energy, (I can see where they are coming from but it's so backwards) and half the renewable energy in the US is wood - biomass, I imagine the same is true for Germany but I'm not positive by how much.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Axel Weber", "channel": "UCSuuDX0C4B_EIN7J2K8jOgA", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ0tvo3320FgXLg0ZgGdzWvHZuxshxxi_EpVkSNKA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's a lie.\nGermany has a black out rate of 13min vs 46min in France and over 240min in the US.\nGermany was the biggest exporter of electricity a couple years ago and had to support the French grid multiple times over the year.\nGermany has a power demand of 45 to 85GW and an installed capacity of 229GW.\n\n\"Now new coal fired plants will be opened\"\n2019 and 2020 there was a steap decline in coal use and in January alone over 5GW of coal power went offline.\n\n\"baseload\"\nIs an absurd talking point which is either disingenuous or based on false information.\nAll load, base and peak load has to be provided for a stable grid. Still ppl use baseload as a talking point and if you actually read the 2011 paper, it would be clear why it is so absurd.\nBaseload isn't needed for a grid, but has economic reasons. Coal(lignite) and nuclear are cheaper if they run 24/7 and that's where baseload came into the discussion.\n\nWe have to get rid of baseload to transition as baseload power plants increase the price of electricity.\n\n\"Increased electricity prices\"\nThis is again either ilinformed or disingenuous.\nGermany has some of the cheapest production cost but most expensive private consumer cost. That sounds paradox but is a fact and there are good reasons for it.\nGermany has the highest taxes/fees on electricity to artificially make electricity more expensive to make ppl safe energy. Then there is a hidden subsidy in that price that increases the price for privat consumers but lowers the price for business consumers (especially big ones like aluminium mills).\nThen there is the fee for the grid, which is unusually big as Germany puts most of the grid underground, which decreases blackout times but increases cost(So higher price, but more security).\nI could go into more detail on this, but I hope I get the point across.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Jakob Schulze", "channel": "UCDPRK2WraJnCdQxHXC8UAQA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQYOL-__VHu35O-HRTigokcc5sDRiKFajGmiA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz_iT76ibNS6HaAz1h4AaABAg.98Aijbq7o5I9H9U6-05JLp", "text": " @Niles Butler   1. What risk? Nuclear Energy is by far one of the safest ways to produce energy, especially considering today’s technology. Add that to the fact that new tech such as small modular reactors are available (just not licensed) which effectively reduce any operational hazards to extremely minimal risk. In practice, nuclear power holds almost no risk at all.\n2. The only cost that can’t be resolved is proper government support. If the government were to provide the type of support (and hopefully much more at that in the near future) that wind and solar are getting you’d see money rolling into the industry as investors realize its promise. With proper RnD not only will we see tech improvements but also dramatic cost reductions from efficiency and economies of scale. \n3. First of all, nuclear is only part of the solution, suitable for complementing a complex system of sustainable energy sources. Maybe only 50% energy will be nuclear, while water solar and wind make up the other 50%. Fuel is not a question, uranium is abundant, and you don’t need that much in volume for it to work. New tech have even allowed for parts of the nuclear waste to be reused as fuel. A long term (as in several tens of years) could even center around extracting uranium from oceans. The opportunities are truly endless, but only if ur willing to think bigger.\n4. Ur arguement of “it’s a dying industry” is based off of surface level observation and not underlying realities. The reality is, plants are closing bc the government refuses to extend contracts on perfectly safe plants. The government refuses to provide the right support or even the right regulation for companies to even think about upgrading or updating their existing plants. Often the owners would rather leave now with profits than to pursue more investment without proper gov support, not because the application of nuclear itself isn’t promising and beneficial to society environmentally and economically. Nuclear already makes up 20% of the US’ power production. Would phasing it out be productive in our efforts to achieve sustainable energy? (No it wouldn’t it would be irresponsible and entirely counter productive). Frankly nuclear energy is indefinitely a piece of the puzzle when it comes to solving the climate crisis and ignoring would be a disservice to society and future generations", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Kelvin J", "channel": "UCiwmO7Jc1sMqbckCAIV3inw", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTw7peDoh04zFdXpDCHRKHc2FTF1MO5MuPgnJiOBQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Of course this number of deaths is more than the ones related to nuclear power plants, however in the theoretical case of an accident, perhaps an explosion, of a nuclear power plant, whole country sides and cities could get inhospitable, causing extreme damage to the nearby environment. Another thing is that agriculture in the contaminated areas would get almost impossible. So that there would be major damage to this area's economy, environment and people. Especially quite small countries, or regions, could theoretically destroy themselves economically for many years to come in the very (!) rare case of such an accident. The conclusion is, that there is a very important potential risk, which every country's people should decide themselves if they are willing to risk it or not.\n\nOr, to be quick: Of course more people die per year because of coal power stations, however in the theoretical case of an accident with a nuclear power plant, the (long term) damage would be much higher than the (short term) one, caused by coal power stations.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "꧁꧂", "channel": "UCu1xOWPZuAxh6i5rgeJuD-A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT8XNu_qPwo0aE40K4zO2D558zMw46GRvZmYCpU=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Smaller countries have no hope of dealing with something like this if it were to happen.\r\nYou might say \"Well that was a natural disaster\", but that doesn't matter, what matters is it happened despite all the safe guards.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the left over waste from Nuclear, yes it's small. however storing it is not as easy as putting it into a football field. \r\nCheckout the Sellafield Nuclear site, there was a Documentary about it a few years ago. To say it was shocking is an understatement.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if thorium reactors ever make it out of the experimental stage, small countries can look at Nuclear power, but the only country looking at those kind of reactors at the moment is China\r\nSo for now, it's something for just the big guys.\r\n\r\nHydro power is renewable in that it it will never run out (however it's is very destructive to the local Eco system). \r\nWith hydro, geothermal, solar, wind and possibly wave and tidal, close to 100% renewable is possible for smaller countries, but it will take a very long time.\r\n\r\nAnd finally to overpopulation, it most certainly is a thing. I take your point that Western countries had a baby boom and populations increased dramatically.\r\nHowever it dwarfs in comparison to the population growth of China and India in the last 20 years.\r\nSo bad was the issue that in China they introduced population control (poorly) basically because they feared another famine would occur.\r\nQuite simply there are to many humans on this planet.

{"cid": "Ugyiz0wFMpBBQ0lCtTF4AaABAg", "text": "21:40 you oversimplified the very real problems people have with current nuclear fission based nuclear power. Beyond the admittedly low risk of nuclear accidents, nuclear fissile material is hard to make and requires harmful strip mining of uranium ore of which only a small fraction is the u-238 isotope needed in the highly refined form to make fissile material. To meet a substantial amount of energy demand of the US would need a level of new mining operations to be approved that we have rarely seen in our history and could be harmful to the environment in other ways besides co2. the reason the co2 impact is so low is because it is relative to per kwh produced which is large in the case of nuclear especially as there is no direct emission of co2. However there are other international non-proliferation policy challenges with regards to enriching a large amount of fissile material to just under weapons-grade required to for reactors. Right now we're using existing plants to slowly drawdown our national stockpile. Re enriching a ton more uranium especially in the current geopolitical situation with various non-prolif treaties being violated by us and russia is asking for another \"cold\" arms race where countries build stockpiles of material that is only days away from being enriched to weapons grade and thus out of current purview of non-prolif treaties. Next the problem with nuclear waste is a lot bigger than you make it. While an annual production of nuclear waste right now is a football field, meeting the necessary demand will need a lot more. Furthermore there is no currently known way of well storing nuclear waste for the long term. Yes current nuclear waste is stored on-site but that is a huge problem as nuclear plants are not able to move it anywhere else due to a whole host of regulatory restrictions! Power plants have to pay disposal companies to take care of it and even then their only solution is to bury it in a desert. With many of the current generation nuclear reactors several decades past their designated operation lifespan, it is unclear whether we have a home for all of this waste because we cant just leave it there. Radioactive waste itself does not have a large radiative zone that is dangerous however it is susceptible to causing a whole host of issues if accidently released to the environment because it easily gets incorporated into the water cycle due to runoff. Only a small amount of nuclear waste is necessary to irrevocably poison entire ecosystems. Look at the effects of depleted uranium coated bullets used as part of tank rounds in the middle east. (NSFW Google search depleted uranium bullets you've been warned against nightmares) We caused untold birth defects for generations and poisoned the land with the small amount of munitions used then. Even worse the half life of the stuff is millions of years which is a debt I'm not sure our children/childrens-children for the rest of time will be able to pay or maintain proper vigilance of wherever we decide to dump it! Imagine if we were doing archeology of a roman site and uncovered a stockpile of nuclear waste and didn't know what radioactivity was, the runnoff would kill hundreds of thousands before we were any wiser. And that is only 2000 years!!! Civilizations will rise and crumble many times before that material is ever going to be safe. We simply cannot rely on current nuclear technology to solve our energy demand. We should be heavily investing in new technology either through fusion or safer fission processes with much shorter half-lifes but until they are viable our main goal is to capture as much of the energy demand as feasible with the economics of scale of efficient-solar photovolatics which are getting better the more we use them and new wind/hydro systems. Theres much more reading to be done on this subject though than I can write in a comment, I hope you do a different video on nuclear and talk about these flaws and need for moonshot level research/investment.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sada Beta", "channel": "UCDC4Mkp2vZdVvgW1JcOKwgA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/OlrCROH4qO0VXgT_AFzsuLgOxSkFEvpDEmT2_KFDVr2qkxiNHYydbcqgMk-36NqtoJOK8vyf7g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugy1v8IkyXzCmjJZ_Al4AaABAg", "text": "I am part of the generation that was indoctrinated by global warming doctrine.  It was not thought as a science, it was tought as fact that you have to blindly accept.  I started looking deeper into it in my late 20s. After listening to scientists of many different disciplines I have come to the conclusion  that warming is currently happening and that man's contribution is insufficient.  Science is not a consensus,  it only takes 1 experiment to prove the falsehood of a Scientific Law. If you had 100 scientists telling you something and an experiment proving them wrong, they are wrong.  Even though there was a consensus that they were right. Not all scientist agree with man made catastrophic climate change. I have watched both sides, the alarmists and the sceptics, present their findings. The alarmists tend to only present computer models. The skeptics tend to present only history, and explanations as to how the climate works. This generally proves that the models are flawed to begin with.  \n\nFirst off. Co2 is plant food.  Plants are very much starved for the stuff.  If you are against co2 emissions you are against global greening.\n\nSecond. If you expect planting trees to be a significant co2 sink you dont know what you are talking about.  I think most people's view on the carbon cycle is flawed. The biggest carbon producer are volcanoes, and the largest sink is the ocean. If you think that man can compete with valcanos for producing or planting trees can compete with the ocean you are dead wrong.  To those that say \"well it was in balance before the industrial revelation\" I say ok show me where.  It wasnt in balance, look at a chart of co2 in the air for the past billion years and you will see it goes all over the place. \n\nThird there is no such thing as a green house gas. The earth does not act like a green house. There is no hot spot in the atmosphere that you should expect to see were it the case.  The atmosphere acts like a jacket not a greenhouse. Its insulation that keeps the planet warm. Carbon has almost no effect on this.  Water vapor appears to be the biggest contributor.  Ever noticed how clouds over head keep the heat in on a cold night, or how they keep the heat out on a hot day?  Ever felt the heat outside and come to the conclusion that it's because of the carbon in the air?  My point is that it's far weaker at insulating us that other gasses.\n\nFourth, I look at the model of physics and I can accurately predict what is going to happen when I do just about anything.  This is what established science does.  Where is this with climate change? Every model ever produced is wrong.  They didn't accurately predict anything.  Climate happens over the course of 30 years. No climate model has come close to predicting anything close to reality over that time span. Why should I believe a model predicting disaster in 100 years if they cant even get 30 right.\n\nFifth, the climate is determined by cycles, upon cycles, upon cycles, upon cycles. These range from the very small local areas to very large solar system wide areas. Knowing this it makes no sense that you can control all of that by just controlling carbon in the air of the planet.   We are talking about a molecule in our atmosphere that is measured in parts per million.\n\nIt is very egocentric to suppose Man has any influence on climate.  Suppose that we did have influence over it, the real question becomes what is the ideal temperature? Should we not be shooting for that? It would seem that life would thrive more with warmer temperatures. There is a good portion of our planet that is barley inhabitable.  The only thing it seems that we can accurately predict about climate is that it will change regardless of what we do. It always has changed it always will.  Reguarding an inconvenient truth. You do realize that predictions were made in that show. And that they didn't happen.  This is the very essence of the scientific method. The hypothesis made in that film was wrong. The conclusion must be that the science was bad.

{"cid": "UgyD1KNniuVaIpZRZnJ4AaABAg", "text": "I did actually work in the nuclear power industry for a time. I was only on a year placement as a student. But I was responsible for installing the cooling system (you thought I was going to say reactor didn't you) for the third level of back up generators used for safe nuclear shutdown incase either the electric grid went down or the primary diesel generators went down. This was in the UK, which had fairly recently been privatized at the time. \n\n\n\nA whole wave of new safety standards were being rolled in (I think the government partly just didn't want to pay for it, so they privatized everything) - everything had to be earthquake proof, flood proof and so on (everything essential had to withstand 1 in 100,000 year events while none essential was 1,000 year events). These were international standards...   I guess we can see how well they were met. And honestly, I thought the approach where I was working was a joke. I didn't even do any nuclear safety training despite being on nuclear plants multiple times. I don't think you can talk about nuclear power without how it is shaped by incentives through capitalism. \n\n\n\nThe situation onthe UK is complicated -a new generation of pressurized water reactors (modelled in French reactors) were to be built but met with a lot of public anti-nuclear protests. Plus the government has been dragging it's feet on new reactors. And basically any UK private companies went bust due to over-exposure to the market in the 2008 financial crash (there was a sealed office where I worked with by far all the best computers and office equipment and decoration that only those working in finance/trading could use). \n\n\n\nAs such we now have aging nuclear reactors in the UK with actual cracks in their reators that were due to be decommissioned but are still running (like they have made control rod manipulators that can steer around the cracks now - I don't need to tell you what role control rods have and how bad it would be if they got stuck). And also what can't be ignored is the connection between nuclear power industries and arms industries. \n\n\n\nLast year the UK produced more power from 'clean' sources than from fussel fuels - producing just more than half from clean sources (which was split evenly between wind/solar ect and nuclear).\n\n\nI probably shouldn't bother with such a long comment, as it feels a waste of time on YouTube (plus you never know if you'll be censored anyway), and there are always masses of comments under videos, but I guess I felt some sense of duty I suppose.

Even when not accounting for the fact that china (one of the leading industrial powers in the world currently, even with the pandemic) would be basically given free-reign while we're expected to sit on our hands and not expand or try to save our own failing local industry would obliterate the US as a world power. You actually bring up a similar argument in your talk about the \"cap and trade\" suggestion in regards to less developed countries. Just because the US has industrialized doesn't exempt us from suffering a similar fate if we gimp ourselves while our neighbors are provided free reign.\n\nIn addition, a lot of the stuff in the green new deal were insane projections being marketed as gospel which to live and work to follow as closely as possible going forward. That's not even to mention the extremely restrictive policies that were attempting to be snuck through with it. I personally didn't mind the idea behind it, but I didn't particularly care for the extra stuff. if there was a re-write focused solely on combating climate change in a way that would not cripple ourselves then there would have been more support for it.\n\nLastly: Yes, dear sweet christ yes. Nuclear power is being fought against tooth and nail by the established power companies to kill it off in it's crib. It's by all metrics far cleaner and more efficient than anything they can produce. If these facts were taught and accepted by the common people as opposed to propaganda or constant focusing on only the drawbacks, then there would be calls for nuclear plants to be built far more often.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Rabbit in Glasses", "channel": "UCBkNoqR55oMgzDJE7uTaQEQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkhTftntKRzvsFHraC_4fS1n0kG7kTZUViYlTu=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzeR1dB1Z29MmJ6VM14AaABAg", "text": "As I understand it, the real problem with nuclear power is that it is EXTREMELY expensive on a per-kilowatt-hour basis. Some of this may be due to excessive regulation (due to the \"radiation, icky!\" fears that the video, for the most part rightly, characterizes as unfounded), but a lot of it is just baked into the medium. Significant increases in use of nuclear power are, bluntly put, going to decrease standard of living because they are going to raise people's electric bills. That's not to say we shouldn't use it-- I don't see any realistic alternative, frankly. But it's like energy chemotherapy-- it messes you up even when it's essential to your survival.\n\nRenewables, by contrast, are quite INexpensive, so we need to be tapping them for all we've got. And carbon capture-- while not the panacea that Big Oil and Big Coal want to make it out to be-- remains a crucial part of the puzzle that deserves research funding.\n\nThe other big part of climate change that isn't widely known or discussed is deforestation-- if one thinks of climate change in economic terms as an overSUPPLY of carbon dioxide, deforestation is like massacreing the consumers who DEMAND the carbon dioxide. Rainforests in particular are enormous carbon sinks; destroying them is an act of ecological insanity that not only guts biodiversity but also hugely increases the greenhouse-gas problem. We'd do well to simply buy all of the surviving rainforests from the countries that hold sovereignty over them (many of which, like Brazil, have shown themselves perfectly willing to indulge in long-term insanity for the sake of some pissant short-term profits) and declare them off-limits to human development; the costs of purchasing the land now are tiny compared with the costs of deforestation in ten or twenty years.\n\nBottom line, we're facing a calamitous problem here, and no one magic bullet or weird trick is going to solve it for us.

He was against cap and trade, and was in favor of a carbon tax. Funny how you left that out. I absolutely believe in climate change. I just don't trust politicians like AOC or Al Gore with taxpayer money. I don't believe we will be in dramatic trouble if in 12 years we don't reduce carbon emissions to zero.\nHere is my main problem with this video. How can you completely disregard overpopulation as an issue?? You say as nations develop, birth rate drops, and i agree with you. But it seems like you think the entire world is developed. There are lots of big developed nations in africa, but particularly in south Africa as the rate of infant mortality dropped, people keep having the same number of kids. Yes we waste a large amount of food, but to stop that you would need to go into the home of every consumer and stop tgem from wasting food. I doubt that can be done in a way thats not authoritarian in nature. Thats all i will say about this subject to keep the comment short but to say overpopulation is not an issue is the same as saying climate change dosen't exist.\nEnding on a good note, i completely agree with you on nuclear power, it seems like a no brainer. In the cold war russia ran a propaganda campaign in the US to make nuclear power look realy bad, to disuade the American population from seeking this new power source, while at the same time heavily funding their own research programs on nuclear power. \nAnyway climate change is real but politicians cant be trusted to deal with the issue. Overpopulation is real and pollution from all our trash in the future will be a worse problem than climate change. Nuclear power will benifit our nation if we can only convince people to adopt it.\nI think calling yourself a moderate is an absolute stretch, especially when you agree with the green new deal. You left alot out about al gore in the video and victimized him, you talk crap about south parks portrayal of Gore but they did literally the same thing with trump and many more public figures.

(like you)\n\n\nit's not like someone would keep private industry from building, or running reactors, thorium included, its just that this time private industry would have to actually invest money into their super safe, cheap to run, safes the world, business model and eventually even have to take the cost of risk into regard... which is exactly, when nuclear stops being 'to cheap to meter' and get's 'to cost prohibitive for even super powers to run', which is when the business clown gets into the picture... or even worse the communist version of it, to remove all redundancy & safety in order to safe cost... what could possibly go wrong?\n\n\n\ni am a big proponent for building more science reactors to generate heavy elements for all the purposes we need them for. all my main concerns still apply to those, but the scale of 'the energy industry of the planet', plays an important role in the argument and while its impossible to 'just make' a complex argument,  (and i am sick and tired of trying from back around in the 90's), but just for the view interested capable of using google in a non hysteria based way, it goes along the line of: residual risk, lots of stuff ignored as a factor, like most accidents happening in fuel preparation... supercriticality accidents... etc. and ends in: not a question of if, but when everyone gets their cancer and at what age.... whereby the timeline can be anything between within the next generation, to a three figure number of generations. also no one except humans would mind much, anyone else is quite O.K., with often having lifespans well under what it takes to get cancer and all their reproducing is long done before even if.\n\n\nalso we don't need 'nucular energy', since the only reason 'bio mass' currently indeed means wood & corn, due to farming and other subsidies. lots of perfectly usable biomass ends up in landfills. lots more could be produced by algae, on land unusable for agriculture, while cleaning the waste water you feed it... it has all been calculated through during the oil crisis and shortly there after.... one of the many things the processes developed around it yields is (as in already exists) would be fiaa approved plain fuel, viable for perfectly normal plains... only issue: 15% - 30% more cost in production (not corrected for technical progress and rising price of drilling) and the final show stopper: all the money currently bound to fossile and nuclear would have to be reinvested, with little to no risk... but still... so it want ever happen, get over it!\n\n\ni stopped caring long ago, i am not depressive or a cynical but i rather invest time into things like boat building, knowledge  preservation, icelandic culture and language... all the things smart people did anytime between 300-900 in northern europe, back when civilization ended the last time.

Nuclear power will be critical in moving the world towards carbon neutrality, and hopefully net negative carbon emissions, but if it isn't done with proper care and oversight, then we could be inviting additional disasters. \nChernobyl brought the Soviet Union down, both politically and economically. The cost of cleanup in rubles and manpower was immense and it is really difficult to know the true human cost in lives because of the efforts to blur the line.

The latter had a shitty spot on the map, but that was accounted for during its construction. Won't happen ever again.... riiiiiight? \n\n\nAnd the worst offender of them all: Costs. Nuclear is incredibly expensive compared to renewables. We are talking ~14 euro cent(without almost eternal storage costs) vs 4,5 (solar) and 3-4 (wind) per kwh. And yes, renewables need a lengthy and somewhat expensive system change (less than you think tho), but its still faster than rolling out thorium based plants (and cheaper too).

You have good points, but in the Olkiluoto powerplant (yes, in Finland) is a long-term nuclear waste storage. It's underground in the bedrock and it will be operational on this decade. So there are solutions. The storage place has room for all nuclear waste produced in Finland's 4 running reactors and 2 that are being built right now.\n\nAlso wind and solar might be a little cheeper, but you have to also consider the pricier fossil-based means of needed energy when talking about solar or wind. Right now we don't have good ways to storage big amounts of energy, so in case of a cloudy or windless day (or night) we have to have and maintain older powerplants (fossile, not eco-friendly) so the electric grid can keep up with the demand.\n\nIn Finland at least, nuclear \"base block\" of electricity is needed to have a working grid, and our political views prefer nuclear over fossil fuels.\n\nAlso nuclear powerplants are one of the safest means of energy production. They are heavily regulated, and even tho accidents have happened, the amount of people affected by them is nothing compared to the amount of people killed each year by air pollution made by fossil-based energy production.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Olli", "channel": "UCs79cRCgl3YV7zkSYGUEcSQ", "votes": "20", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR6WzsGFSdFPafQwp1WUokued_5B3avhX9kwH29ZQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgxanX0s1rYkgAVFlih4AaABAg.9823tqwQ2EL98FBhWv4EME", "text": "Max Mustermann let me try to address the problems you named\n\nNuclear waste:\nCurrently there are a few sites for waste storage currently under construction, the most prominent being in Finland, while the U.S. has had considerable trouble getting its long term storage site constructed because of political bullshit. I mean, the U.S. could do what France is doing and go through the process of recycling nuclear waste, which lets you extract leftover uranium from nuclear waste and could reduce the amount of waste while also reducing the amount of uranium that we need to mine and the subsequent emissions created from the process of mining that uranium, but it’s been banned by congress and there really isn’t a good reason for it to be banned. Using Thorium as fuel for reactors could also cut down on the amount of waste as it is much more efficient than uranium while also being less radioactive than uranium. So we have the ability to handle the waste problem, but politicians have their heads up their asses and aren’t doing anything to fix the problem\n\nNuclear meltdowns:\nChernobyl and Fukushima were horrible accidents. Not a lot of people actually died because of them, but the long lasting radiation and exclusion zones set up around the sites is still significant. But they were both reactors from the 1960s. Nuclear reactors were new at the time, and are nowhere near as safe as modern reactors. It’s like any new technology. At first, cars didn’t have seatbelts, airbags, or any other safety devices in them, but modern cars are extremely safe and will only continue to get safer. Same with practically anything else. As time goes on new technology is developed that makes nuclear safer. \n\nCost: \nNuclear power plants are expensive to build because the way they are currently build requires them to be custom designed and built for the area they are built in. But new Small Modular Reactors solve that problem. A building would be made to house multiple reactors, and then the reactors themselves would be produced in a streamlined, factory like setting, loaded onto the back of a truck, driven out to the housing unit and installed. This will significantly cut down production costs, and reduce the amount of time it takes to build a nuclear power plant. \n\nFusion:\nIf you’re still opposed to nuclear fission, then take a look at fusion power. Don’t like how nuclear fission uses radioactive materials like uranium and leaves behind deadly waste? Fusion uses hydrogen, you know, the most abundant material in the universe, as its fuel, and the waste product is helium. Are you scared about a fission reactor having a catastrophic meltdown? The specific conditions needed to sustain a fusion reaction mean that if anything goes wrong, inside of blowing up and releasing tons of radiation into the surrounding area, it will just turn off. Sounds great, right? Well it also will be able to produce more energy than fission. And it’s right around the corner as well. ITER, a project founded by multiple countries like France, The UK, and the U.S. is scheduled to be turned on by 2025, and a multitude of companies are also racing to be the first to achieve positive energy gains from fusion.

There’s one in NV that the politicians have been trying to slam the brakes on for decades, but it’s a prime spot because it’s a natural salt deposit and eventually over the next thousand years, the salt will creep into every square inch of the facility and hopefully render it useless forever. We also will have signs in 7 different languages surrounding the facility just in case any civilization down the line finds it, doesn’t know the context, and tries to open it. Second, chernobyl was a string of freak accidents that led to disaster in the 70s, and Fukushima was a literal act of god scenario. You can’t guess when a tsunami is suddenly going to hit your nuclear plant, but even in that situation there are options to make it safer. \nPlutonium, uranium-235 and uranium-233 are the most common now, but thorium reactors have been gaining a lot of traction lately which is really exciting to me. \nThorium is infinitely safer, cheaper to mine, much more common, less work intensive to purify, and also since it is a fissile element, it is a lot more stable as an element as well. A meltdown like 3 mile island, Fukushima or chernobyl could almost never happen in a thorium reactor, and the only part that would be unstable is a tiny amount of plutonium that you’d have to use to start the fission process, which means by cutting off the access to plutonium-239 in the event of a meltdown, you would effectively be stopping it in its tracks. \nStop trying to scare people, nuclear energy can be safe, whether that is something you agree with or not. People are just terrified of it because when things go wrong in a nuclear reactor, despite the scale you can look at the consequences and say “Oh god, the horrors! Look at what wrath god hath wrought!” Despite that, in oil and coal refineries like Port Arthur, when a refinery is slowly poisoning an entire city with a median household income of 15k, it’s just business casual.

{"cid": "UgxXvKZ2Boevve3g0IV4AaABAg", "text": "[TL;DR - Carbon Capture and Nuclear are the way to go for now, with cap and trade as the incentive to push governments forward in this direction.]\n\nFew things - pretty much the only few things I can agree with in this video are the statements about nuclear and about the poor state of renewables (as someone studying Renewable Energy Sources, I can quite safely confirm that)\n\n\n\n\nHOWEVER:\nClimate change is a theory. It's not a fact. It is a theory in scientific terms - it's backed by evidence, confirmed using the scientific method, there's no currently known evidence that would contradict it, but it's still not a set-in-stone fact. There could still be discovered new evidence that flips it upside down. \n\nClimate change is a better term than global worming. It sounds less scary and less pressing on paper, but is more adequate to what we're experiencing. Yes, the Earth is warming up, but it's not the only effect (though granted - most of other side effects, like increased severity of violent storms, seem to be a direct consequence of rising temperatures themselves).  Climate change is a broader term, suggesting it will affect a bigger portion of our lives than just \"it'll be a bit warmer\". \"Global warming\" also makes it seem like it's Earth's problem, not ours, which is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, that climate activists focus their activism on polar ice caps and poor little animals, something most people don't really care about. The main problem, the main reason for concern is the concern on human lives. That's where the activism focus should be, that's what more people care about. \n\nIndustrial revolution happening in different parts of the world at different times... Yes. That is true. But what if we extend that line of thinking further? What if we extend that line of thinking to colonialism? I mean - those countries didn't have their colonial times when some European powers had theirs! Should we close our eyes to that, and allow those countries to invade and colonise other nations? Maybe we should allow slave trade? Maybe we should allow for the existence of Chinese concentration camps of Uyghur Muslims, because Nazi Germany had their concentration camps for Jews and Soviet Russia had Gulags for everybody who dared to oppose the great leader? \nAs you can see - just because they didn't experience something when other nations did, doesn't mean we should allow it to happen. There are other ways of achieving industrialisation without allowing for more pollution and greenhouse gas emission. \n\nGreen New Deal would be nice, if it would focus on climate, without diving into topics unrelated to it (granted - some economic stuff is needed, as to address the loss of jobs resulting from implementing technologies making fossil fuels obsolete, but what in the name of all that's holy does  high-quality health care and affordable, safe, and adequate housing have to do with it?). Also - better people in charge, someone who can take it seriously, act without panic-baiting, and actually work on the issue, respectfully educating sceptics and people without knowledge that have questions, without resorting to angrily shouting at them and calling them \"fascists\", and people able to work with governments on the solutions, not screetching \"orange man bad\" all day and not doing anything for the climate. \n\nTrees aren't a great source of greenhouse gas storage long term. Fossil fuels, as the name implies, are fossilised remains, that have been buried deep inside the Earth. Those trees would offset the carbon emissions for some time, but after they die, they decay, releasing a lot of what's stored back into the atmosphere. It's a band-aid on a wound that needs stitches, a would that without them, opens back up every now and again. \n\nOverpopulation argument doesn't take into account just the food, but the entire carbon footprint of a person - a place to live, work, necessities like clothes, work equipment.\n\nCarbon capture (and storage) - it's more than a cigarette filter. Yes, it captures \"some\" (quite a lot, actually), but not all of the emissions. That's why development in this area, to capture even more, as much as it's possible. It's effective and cheap, requiring a relatively inexpensive  modification of existing infrastructure, while working on long term goals. Harm reduction. A bandage you put on the wound on your way to a hospital. \n\nCap and Trade - it's a financial incentive to lower emissions, and a financial burden on those exceeding the limits. A cap is usually set at a level that allows for relatively normal operation, assuming proper development, but lower than regular use, leaving emitters at a choice - either switch to cleaner energy (with the cap set at a limit that allows for it in a proper amount of time) or continue to pay more and more. This makes switching to cleaner energy sources more financially viable option. And money rules the world. \n\nOne thing I'll also add about renewables is their impact on the environment - the benefit of fossil fuels (that includes nuclear) is that it's energy dense. It allows to relatively small operation both on the mine side as well as power plant side. Renewables often require a lot of area to produce the same amount of energy, and even more to store it, for when it's dark and not windy. Currently, renewables are very inefficient, produce power ad hoc and don't provide sufficient power continuously, requiring proper _\"random\"_conditions to be just right, can't work in a lot of places and due to their nature - are very localised. There is work on making wind farms start at slower wind speeds and be able to safely operate at higher wind speeds, solar panels are getting denser and thinner, their efficiency is rising, but right now it's not sustainable. It's a very long term solution, that's still in it's infancy. Maybe by the end of this centaury we'll reach 100% renewables, but probably not 2050, and definitely not 2030. \n\nCarbon Capture and Nuclear are the way to go for now, with cap and trade as the incentive to push governments forward in this direction.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "rubbers3", "channel": "UCmziQfo7yDDEDafQOZZ08Fw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSt_saYqoWZ4Bw0cMKoqrXLpVODKmXQjTK-pZ-t=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The greenhouse gas's you are refering to about wind and solar I guess must be in the manufacturing, commissioning and decommissioing of turbines and panels, which, when considering the energy output, is 90 times less for wind than that of coal.  Wind and solar energy do not produce any greenhouse gases while they produce energy.  Nuclear on the otherhand does produce a greenhouse gas.  Steam!  Water molecules in the air reflect light to the earth, although they are not as bad as CO2 it's still more than wind or solar.  Also as you are going to chaulk up disregarding wind and solar because of construction CO2 output than why does that not count when talking about nuclear.  Nuclear plants require construction projects that get more and more complex as newer generations designs are required.  Also, one of the reseans that nuclear has far fewer deaths than oil and gas is because it is way less common,  its like comparing the number of kangaroos in australia to the number in iceland.    I'm not against nuclear, but thats the point.  This is not discussion about what is the one and only best alternative the fossil fuels, you can use a variation of different methods, you don't have to disregard wind energy in favour of nuclear, you can use wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, nuclear all where they are most viable.

{"cid": "UgzPValz2eIoQ_p_7Fh4AaABAg", "text": "Overall, pretty fair summation of the situation. Though the \"Overpopulation isn't a thing\" thing is spectacularly misleading and the portrayal in this video was hugely misleading. You're avoiding the fact that this is all caused by there being so many humans on the planet. Yes, you are factually correct in WHAT YOU SAID. But what you chose NOT to communicate, is the graphs of global temperature, CO2 Production, Energy consumption, and population, over time. Exponential growth that tracks over each other. Overpopulation is the current problem. Renewable energy and responsible reproduction, are the solution.\n\nYes, some countries populations have already boomed and are now starting to stabilise, others are still rising or \"yet to rise\" and it isn't fair for more developed countries to impose limits on less developed ones that hold them back in a way the developed ones weren't. But who they hell thinks it's completely reasonable and acceptable to have five kids and each of their kids to have  five kids in the USA or Europe?! Health care is good enough that you're most likely going to end up with five adult children. It's exponential growth and it's unsustainable. Each one of those people require resources to survive. Yes, it's technically possible to provide for the current existing population in a responsible way. And even if we don't, the Earth will change and adapt without us. It's ourselves and a lot of other unfortunate species that we are screwing over. Nuclear is better than burning fossil fuels, the problem is that the danger hype around it makes every conceivable safety feature a social requirement, which drives the cost up and makes the time to build and commission prohibitive. Renewable's have come a long way and are now potentially faster and cheaper. There are other issues with intermittency and base load. There are  potential solutions like pumped hydro. Nuclear seems like a terrible long term idea, but it's a hell of a lot better than burning more fossil fuels in the short term. \n\nDie now, die later, die never. We get to chose. Fossil fuels are die now, nuclear is die later, renewable is die never... This is all caused by there being so many humans on the planet though.\n\nI do agree that we shouldn't be building fossil fuel power plants and should be building Nuclear in the short term, with renewable as the long term goal.

Nuclear is not renewable and Uran extraction creates also tons of toxic waste.\n2. In the entire world there is literally only one long-term storage facility for nuclear waste (in Finland). We are creating tons of toxic waste, not knowing how to deal with it in the  long-term.\n3. Nuclear is the least cost-efficient of all energy-production when you calculate the total lifespan/post-lifespan cost of the construction of the powerplants and waste-treatment. I don't know how things are in the US, but in Germany those things are mainly paid for by the government and is heavily subsidised to keep the price competitive.\n4. It's not all about the source but also the consumption, which we need to reduce massively. \n5. Renewables (especially wind and solar) are getting better and more efficient by the year and their lifespan is much longer now. In the future they keep getting better.\n6. One problem with nuclear is the centralisation. You need extensive power line systems, where you loose a lot of energy. The future of energy is decentralised.\n\n\nRight now we don't have a perfect solution to our power demand and you are right to say that right now we can't produce 100% of our energy with renewables. But renewables is the main horse we should be betting on, in total environmental impact they are the best. While I do see some advantages of nuclear compared to fossil fuels and they have reduced some of the greenhouse-gas emissions, I think the cost-benefit of nuclear (at least in it's current form) is worse than renewables. The story will be different if we're talking fusion-power of course. \n\nI think Hank Green did a good comentary on the issue, but in your video I missed the nuance, which you normally are really good at.

{"cid": "Ugx-2jm81oQzEDFaXSp4AaABAg.981X53KgIBE9ApEsz1bSbF", "text": "Hi Valentin,\n\nInteresting points, and many of the things you say are true but, in my view, they lack a comparative perspective. When comparing renewables and nuclear, one has to (i) take the viewpoint of the electricity system as a whole and (ii) factor in the fact that to extract power from wind or solar (or water), one has to build the extractors (i.e. wind turbine, the panel, the dam,...). The production of these extractors relies on materials et metals, some.of which are not at all renewables. For example, neodyme heavily used in wind turbines (especially offshore) is a rare earth element.\n\n1- Uranium is not renewables, but not metal is and \"renewables\" used metals a lot (more than nuclear on a per MWh basis). All metals extraction create tons of toxic wastes, it's the same for uranium and renewables\n\n2- The problematic nuclear waste (high radioactivity and long lifespan) can be safely stored underground. We know that because there has been nuclear waste for millions of years in Africa (created by natural reactors billions of years ago) and the heavy dangerous elements have stayed exactly where they had been produced. This is the conclusion of the French nuclear authority, which is one of the strictest in the world on safety. I can cité référence if needed.\n\n3- Cost efficiency of nuclear is only unfavorable when one look at it from the point of view of the capacity unit. When looking from the point of view of the electricity system as a whole, one must take into account the storage systems and additional network line required for a 100% solar/wind system to work. Once this is taken into account, nuclear comes out on top.\n\n4- agreed ! Energy efficiency and sobriety is always the best solution.\n\n5 - That could be true for the future. But there are also much better nuclear technology that only waiting to be developed, so if one wants to taken into account future possibilities, one needs to do so for both technology.\n\n6 - Centralisation is much more efficient from a systems perspective than decentralization. Losses in transmission lines is only about 2-3%, but for only this loss, you get to spread you capacity over the entire network. If you want a decentralised power system, the peak power of your decentralised unit must be equal to your peak consumption. With centralised systems, since people don't use all of the country's power at the same time, you can power 200 GW of theoretical peak power with only 50 GW of production capacity.\n\nI hope this was useful.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Will X", "channel": "UCf-iLEgo5xGm_U7mfGXC9KA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRqxjhgvypZnhPcg94C3WROx_b5BEKS_lQLTw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Altogether, industries can emit up to 10; if you want a higher share of that 10, you must pay the companies who are \"doing their part\" for the privilege of that emission.

Nuclear power plants in Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Afghanistan, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Syria? (Just to name a few obvious ones.)\n(2) Nuclear fuel is a limited resource. Uranium at current levels of consumption will last quite a while, but this is with nuclear power plants producing just about 14% of global electricity at current consumption levels, with projections being that total electricity consumption might double until 2050. At 100% Nuclear Uranium reserves would last for about 10 years without using breeder reactors. About these I refer back to (1) ... global proliferation of Plutonium production sounds like a rather bad idea to me.\n(3) The oft proposed solution for (2) of using Thorium has never even seen a successful prototype. In fact the only few prototypes I know of all failed spectacularly after spending billions on them. Taking into account the lessons learned then, getting from the draft stage to a working plant will still take at best ten years.\n(4) Building nuclear power plants takes an average of ~10 years from first concrete to first power, and that is including China that is more efficient at building these by nature of being a dictatorship. On top to number excludes the planning stage, so you'd have to add another five years or so, at the least.\n(5) No company in the world would currently be able to build enough reactors in parallel. The companies that historically built most of the existing plants (GE, Siemens, Areva) have more or less shut down the relevant divisions. Not sure about Russian companies, but Soviet tech doesn't sound like a good idea. And the Chinese? Well, for once they are quite busy with projects in their own country, and then there's the matter of geopolitics, again ... \n\nRamping that back up to the necessary capacity would probably take another ten years or so ... nuclear engineers don't grow on trees.\n\n(6) Running nuclear plants would be a problem in at least half the world. It requires qualified personnel, supply chains, expensive maintenance etc. Someone once suggested to me that this could be solved by the companies building the plants contracting to run them, too, but this kind of Neo-colonialism wouldn't go down too well nowadays, either.\n\n\n\nI agree, fifteen or twenty years ago nuclear (fission) might have been an option from a tech point of view, at least as a bridge technology, but the fact is it wouldn't have been feasible politically.

Even a 10% (a low estimate) capture of their emissions would significantly affect countries totals.\n\nRenewables also obviously play a very important role, especially alternative storage technologies; solar heat storage (using a salt based steam cycle) and pumped water storage paired with wind; both already exist and are fairly effective at reducing the huge power variations. \n\nOlder technologies factor into that as well, like tidal barrages and hydroelectric which was touched on briefly, if it goes towards reducing dependence on fossil fuel emissions go for it; same goes for hydrogen electrolysis and fuel cells.\n\nOverall the goal is in the future to have the vast majority of power come from renewable sources; wind farms, solar plants and hydroelectric dams, (hydrogen and tidal/wave power too maybe); but as you mention a strong base will be needed to support that and Nuclear can fill that niche and provide that...\n\nThe net emissions from nuclear are astonishingly low (including the whole mining to disposing fuel cycle) and Fusion and GenIV reactors show a lot of promise for deployment in 10-20 years...

The radioactive waste comes from the products of uranium fission, and it is genuinely dangerous and hard to deal with. There is no known physical mechanism to make radioactive nuclei safe except to wait for them to decay, which can take tens or hundreds of thousands of years. That's why finding permanent storage locations for nuclear waste has been a difficult problem.\n\nExcept, we had a solution for the U.S. in Yucca Mountain. Unfortunately, that closed, because unsurprisingly, nobody wants to live near a nuclear waste repository, and there was no way to maintain political support for long enough to complete the project, or, more importantly, ensure it could continue operating in the long term. If we could reassure people of its safety and be believed, we wouldn't have to store nuclear waste in dry casks near cities.

Right now, greenhouse gases trap 600TWh per hour, and if you multiply that by the number of hours in a year, that goes to about 5 million TWh. The world currently uses only 165,000-ish per year. So, no big deal, right? For now, that is correct. But when the population goes to 11 billion, and each person is using 5 times the energy that each of us (in the US) currently uses, then we will be using about 5million TWh per year.\nIt won't matter that it's from nuclear. It will still be adding the same amount of heat that is currently being trapped by greenhouse gases.\nI made another comment 13 hours ago, but youtube has blocked it for some reason.

Now, the industrialized country would have to either buy their extra credits elsewhere, or (and here’s the kick) they would be incentivized to reduce their own emissions. As a caveat, in my Environmental Econ class, we didn’t talk about cap and trade on an international scale, and I imagine such a policy would be really difficult to enact. We only talked about it on a state/national level, which is really what the policy is designed for. By setting the cap lower than current emissions, the price of trade would increase, and people would be more incentivized to reduce their emissions than to buy credits off someone else, depending on the cost of reducing emissions.

{"cid": "Ugz0v7lIGTj4zgZIpxN4AaABAg.980pTx7M1Dz984X35DEIbx", "text": "Overpopulation might technically not be a direct problem, but it is a major contributing factor since it basically acts as a multiplier. Even if everyone changed their living standards, there always will exist a limit for how many people with those standards the Earth can sustain. The limit is higher on moderate standards, and much lower on extravagant ones.\n\n\n\n\nEarth receives certain amount of energy from the Sun. Photosynthesizers convert this to useful form of energy, which in turns virtually all other life. Let's say X is the amount of this energy that humans can take advantage of. Let's also say every human needs Z amount of energy. Using maths we could technically calculate how much is the upper limit.\n\n\nFor most of history, when the X had changed due to climate change, erosion and destruction of previously arable land or by overhunting of some animal, the nature would do the regulation of populations. On good years the populations would rise, and on bad ones go down.\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment were having a major good time, and one could attribute that to many factors, such as the neck breakingly fast technological advancement, the very effective fertilizers we've come up with and agricultural industrialization. All of which are true, but I think most importantly it's because of cheap energy. \n\n\n\nLet's take oil for the example. Oil is basically the energy of the old Sun, which has been forming beneath the earth for many many years. Production of that oil required no effort from our part, only digging it up and refining it for use. The amount of energy you get from this is extremely high compared to the amount one needs to invest in order to get it. This has enabled us to use the machines we use on food productions, fly to other continents and use for personal mobility without second thought.\n\n\nCheap energy is what runs the modern world. It's used to run the machines that produce the food cheaply, transport that food, other goods and us cheaply, heat our homes cheaply, generate the energy and whatsnot. Energy use has been on the rise on tandem with growing populations and growing living standards, and increasingly continues to be. The obvious unfortunate thing about that is the fact we are running out of those cheap sources.\n\n\nThat's only the energy department, not to speak of the lost arable soil due to too intense acgricultural practises, over-use of fertilizers and pollution.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION: I get why people tread the subject of population growth with such care, since quite many other people, many with racist and scetchy eugenic agenda, argue for population growth control (or maybe more precisely, they argue for control of certain populations).

This would replace LNG and coal powerplantd as baselines and provide a nice cushion for transition to full renewables over 30 years. Also, nuclear is not inherently more expensive when land and transportation is factored in. Next generation nuclear powerplants are also relatively safe, having built in failsafes to prevent problems such as Chernobyl. Lastly, the problem of storing nuclear waste, which I assume is one thing you reference when you talk about “unsolved problems and risks” is largely about overcoming fear.

{"cid": "Ugyt-xe-fwPvPc8oqZJ4AaABAg", "text": "So you just trash renewables without presenting any evidence to support it and then say nuclear is the best without addressing any of the biggest problems with it? Okay, \"knowing better.\" Guess I'm still being lied to about it. What is this nonsense about solar farms only lasting a few years? Solar farms can theoretically last many decades with only one or two key components needed to be replaced every 10-20 years or so. Solar panels offset the amount of energy it takes to build and set them up in less than 6 months.  Yes, solar and wind use rare earth metals. No, rare earth metals are not rare. There is low demand for them, so production is correspondingly low, but could be ramped up to meet renewable needs. It is true that renewables could not power 100% of needed energy with current technology, but they don't have to. As long as they met about ~80% or so of energy needs, which they can with current technology, the remaining amount could be met by other sources like nuclear or carbon neutral fossil fuels, and that would be enough to account for the unreliable aspects of solar and wind generation. Speaking of nuclear, now there's a technology that could never be scaled up to meet the world's energy needs. There's a million and one issues with it, but some of the biggest are cost and uranium supply. Simply put, any more efficient types of reactors (like fast breeders for example) are too expensive to justify right now compared to traditional reactors. Uranium would have to get so rare before the price was jacked up high enough to make efficient reactors economically feasible that there wouldn't be enough left to power the world for much longer anyway. And don't forget that many of the proposed technologies to make nuclear viable simply do not exist! There are no commerical thorium reactors. There is no commercial uranium seawater extraction. It's currently in the realm of science fiction and may stay like that forever. We may be \"close\" for years, and that's not good enough. Even if we had it now, it takes way too long to construct new nuclear plants. By the time we would get them up and running it would be too late to be useful. And those have to be replaced too. If you built enough nuclear power plants to power the world you would have to build and deconstruct a new plant somewhere in the world every single day, give or take. And these are massive, expensive projects that take years to construct and have very specific land requirements. Nuclear is fine where it is right now.

{"cid": "UgxCiUI-g5V3Lov0fft4AaABAg", "text": "Hi, I know you did your research for this video, but my degree is literally in the energy side of this subject. Because of this, I will just chime in with a little bit of extra context and a few corrections. I am going to start off by explaining a couple of Political Science concepts, and then move into explaining the context using certain countries as examples. This is a very complicated subject and I want to explain it without really mentioning the partisan politics aspect. \r\n\r\nFirstly, there are 2 main Political Science concepts that must be understood. These are Sovereignty and the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Sovereignty is the idea that there is no higher power above the states. Depending on what school of Political Science you come from, this can mean very different things. However, the 3 main schools of thought are variations of Realists, Liberals, and Constructivists. But generally (and take this with a deep understanding that the theories do differ tremendously) this means that states (as in governments) are the primary actors in the international realm. Some of these schools (Liberals and Constructivists in particular) accept non-state actors, but to what extent varies greatly.\r\n\r\nAs for the Prisoner’s dilemma, this is the idea that even though the theoretical best results would be gained by working together, the uncertainty of not knowing the other actor’s intentions will lead to the actual best result to be defecting. You can find lots of material on this, so I will just leave it as is for now.\r\n\r\nNow, when looking at the various agreements, these 2 theories need to be considered. This is why these agreements always have opt-out clauses. Getting any country to agree to an agreement with massive penalties would be incredibly difficult. However, having an agreement is the best way of getting around the Prisoner’s Dilemma. So, this generally leads to weak treaties with little enforcement ability. \r\n\r\nAs for the argument about developing countries, this false into a fallacy of assuming that there is only 1 way to develop. Take phones for example. Cell phones ownership in Africa has skyrocketed in the last decade. This is despite landlines never really catching on. Technological advancement allows you to skip parts of development. So, the assumption that developing countries need coal plants because it is the only path to development is just wrong. The truth here is that coal prices are just really low in comparison to the cost to develop the type of grids necessary to have a large renewable network. \r\n\r\nEven countries like Japan, who have promised to have massive investment (and is in their best interest as they import 85% of their energy) in renewables, are only using it to off set their normal energy sources. This is because the storage is extremely expensive, and it is cheaper to use renewables when it is available but use fossil fuels to make up the difference. For example, Japan has massive solar investments going on, but these new facilities will only function during the day. However, that overlaps with peak energy demand, and may cover ~60% of energy use. \r\n\r\nAs for the argument about nuclear energy. It is largely very good. However, you ignored the refurbishment costs. Nuclear reactors need tens of millions of dollars of refurbishments every couple of decades. This is why many of them have been closing in Europe in the last couple of years. The price to keep them open mixed with the political cost has proven to great in many areas. Of course, nuclear is generally extremely safe, but there are reasons why it has been decreasing in recent years.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "mattbenz99 [Canadian Gambit]", "channel": "UCo7VMxB1jowvyNG49vtIBfw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRDkzm0mU_2FVSWVZnPVgGm1NPXVra-ZC86HCVX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As an oversimplified example; \n- 1)  Assume each State in US has 5 Carbon Credits, for a total of 250 Credits.  \n- 2)  Assume the Total Emission of 250 Credits worth to be within an acceptable range of emissions.  (Or at least the current goal for the year or decade, if we need to make baby steps)\n\nAssuming these two rules, wealthier areas are in a way 'privileged' to more emissions than others.  But only by investing money into less wealthy areas. \n\nBut wouldn't the high value resource in 'Carbon Credits' incentivize investments into less emissive energy forms in order to be more conservative with the way one spends the Credits they have access to?  Thus creating an organic way for those playing by the rules to be pursuing more green energy over time without oppressive measures taken?\n\n_ _\n\nThat said, while I do think it is one of multiple potential tools that could and perhaps should be implemented that has its benefits.  I do have my own reservations in such a system; specifically, less in terms of it's inefficiency, but more in terms of the usual risks associated with iterative trading systems.  \n\nIf poorly regulated, one area or group of areas could potentially monopolize all the Carbon Credits.  So measures would need to be taken against that, such as heavy taxes for Emissive companies that are operating within areas that \"own\" more Carbon Credits as per each Tier.  (I.E.  An area with 6+ Credits Pays a notable sum, one with 11+ pays more, etc.)\n\nThis would hopefully incentivize businesses that make use of Carbon Credits to expand into other areas that have both a workforce and Carbon Credits available; such as developing areas that would otherwise have suffered limited development by trading away their Carbon Credits for quick paychecks.  \n\n_ _\n\nPerhaps more importantly however, is the intuitive nature of Cap and Trade breaks the complex issue into a simple form, allowing a complex issue that is scientific in nature with a lot of broad statistics to be understood with small numbers and effectively criticized without heavy research.  \n\nOverall; i think that paired with some comprehensive supporting rules, a well balanced system integrating Cap and Trade could be a potent strategy, as well as intuitive enough for people to understand.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Know Dice", "channel": "UCpdosD5YsFlF4Dfk9T8BX7w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRYgsst_WVdsh0mn5afq35a2URruD3l5Q5qNXlfCg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If it was a Nuclear waste and an explosive truck then they could have been turned into the worlds biggest dirty bomb.( I hope the NSA doesn't flag me) and set it off in Las Vegas. Bikini Island in the Pacific was used  for nuclear testing  was caped. It is now deteriorating and starting to leak . As sea levels rise  it will end up  leaking to the sea adding to the leaking radioactive  water from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster ( They though it was earthquake proof ) that is still leaking . The Japanese  Don't know how to stop it . Nuclear options are not long term solutions .Most of  Solar and wind energy systems can be recycled most of a nuclear power system can not. The Technology for long term Solar, wind ,wave and even Biomass (other thing other then wood can be used )  is improving . There are a few other forms of energy production in the experiment phase that can  be helpful. None of these can do it all on their own. We need to implement the one that is best suited for the environment it will be operating in and rely on as many safe secure  systems as we can. Building new Nuclear Plants should not be part of that plan but should only be used as a stop gap in the interim as we improve the safer, more secure and eco friendly options.. BTW I have a military back ground in NBC(CBR) in detection and decontamination. (54 E was the MOS back then) A lot of you comments on are the slanted info from the Nuclear power industry.  They only fed you all the pros and few of the Cons and downplayed or omitted a lot of  the safety and security problems .

{"cid": "UgwgZDCI2j5mMGOkXKV4AaABAg", "text": "Was with you until you said that renewables would likely never meet energy demands. What is your basis for this? You also say that they usually need to be supplemented by coal or natural gas. Why do you think this? Due to the intermittency i.e. lack of energy storage? Or just lack of installed capacity? Because both of these are issues that already have clear solutions but just need time and investment. I strongly disagree that these issues can't be solved within the near future. My own country (Scotland) already has enough installed wind power capacity that we produce more energy from wind alone than we need on many days of the year.\n\nI do agree with your conclusions about biomass, yes it's not viable solution. I think this is becoming consensus in the scientific community already, and I doubt you will find many scientists who will go to bat for biomass as the saviour.\n\nTo be clear, I am pro-nuclear, I think countries like France, Belgium, Slovakia have benefitted enormously from their nuclear programmes. And yes, the issue of nuclear waste has been massively blown out of proportion of decades. Where I think you got this wrong though was glossing of Chernobyl, and only mentioning Fukushima in passing. Okay, more people have likely died as a result of fossil fuels, but how many people have been struck by a wind turbine blade? Maybe some of the processes involved in refining materials for solar panels, collectors, and turbines produce air pollution. But I nuclear power has killed more, of that I'm sure. The 'propaganda number' for deaths due to nuclear sits wrong with me as well. No one can know how many people have been killed by nuclear, in the same way you can't know how many have died of fossil fuels. Personally, my girlfriend and many of her friends have thyroid problems as a direct result of Chernobyl (born in Poland 1986). Nuclear disasters effect vast vast numbers of people, and it's not something that ended with Chernobyl, and it won't end with Fukashima.\n\nI think there is a general American bias towards nuclear power emerging. Many people are just realising all lies that they've been told about it, and now believe it to be the saviour. While in Europe (many countries intend to phase out the reactors), and soon probably in Japan (most of there reactors have been shut down for now), where we have felt the effects of nuclear disasters first hand, there is a more nuanced understanding that Nuclear power is deeply deeply flawed.\n\nStill enjoyed the video thought.

I still disagree with this, it is more expensive in terms of direct cost per kW. In terms of the simplicity of solar and wind (which I think you're giving as your argument why renewables are over a hundred years away from viability). Are you suggesting that nuclear power is simpler? I assure you it isn't, nuclear power is very very difficult. It is resource, time, and cost intensive at first because a country needs a highly specialised workforce, as well as significant infrastructure to import and enrich uranium. In contrast renewable have a much lower bar of entry, it is insanely easy for anyone to wack a solar panel or wind turbine in their back garden, and this level of difficulty doesn't increase much with district sized energy production.\n\nI think are key disagreement here is that you just think nuclear will work sooner, and better. I agree that we need to eliminate fossil fuels as fast as possible, I'm not asking us to delay that period to wait around for renewables, but nuclear isn't as easy as I think you think it is. The technology is already there for a total global energy production from renewables, I'm not asking you to just believe that, it's a fact, there are countries (as i mentioned in my first comment) that already produce more renewable energy than they need on good days.\n\nI don't follow your final point on water energy. What are you talking about specifically? Pumped hydro storage? Tidal? Wave? One thing very few people seem to be talking about as well is that at current rates we'll run out of uranium in 80 years, if the whole world decides to go with nuclear, we'll run out much sooner. Solar and wind are true renewable, there is no reasonably accepted reason that one day we won't be able to use them.\n\nSo perhaps people ought to start thinking about the generation after them, because all we do by focusing totally on nuclear is what our parents did to us with their focus on fossil fuels.

{"cid": "UgzG0XfCUBkxY0WKF7Z4AaABAg", "text": "What about the problem of nuclear plants not being financially viable without the use of public funds? Also, I grew up near a nuclear waste storage site, and they did occasionally have to fix leaks into the river, where we swam and fished, but they didn't fix the leaks very quickly, and they didn't tell us it happened until way after. I'm trying to research if they are still dumping the cooling water from the Fukushima disaster or if they figured out another solution. What do you think about the current ability at containing nuclear waste successfully, for the duration of the time it needs to be contained? I understand that every power generation method has drawbacks. If nuclear waste can be contained well in theory, what is preventing it from being contained well in practice? It seems like your video is saying there is no other option, but what about the painful \"taking responsibility\" option? There are ways to use less carbon per person, although they do take more work. An example is a chest-freezer shaped fridge (that doesn't dump out the cold when you open the door.) Another is if you look into super- effeciant woodstoves, they have some that can burn hot enough to burn their own smoke and use less wood (maybe a tenth?) with drastically reduced smoke/carbon emissions. (Heat is a major energy use in the US. Fridges are not but it made a good physical example of inconvenience.) I feel like if we are talking to someone who has a money spending problem, and we are trying to tell them that they need to spend a lot less- and they keep saying \"how about credit cards? What about a bank loan? Private money lending? Can I sell my organs?\" When what they need is to actually spend less- for us, I'm talking carbon per person in developed nations. That would be a great way to lead the world. I would like to have the goal be how to make carbon friendly be comfortable and fun, like skylights, veggie gardens, and walkable neighborhoods, and how to focus on using carbon emissions on what's important to the country, rather than on how to keep the carbon spending high. Isn't it possible that we could do a lot of what we do now, some of it more luxuriously, using less carbon? An uncle of mine has to fly constantly for work, but it is really not as fun as it may sound. If we could develop better conferencing software (or methods?) perhaps some of that could be avoided and give him a happier job, too. It would be wonderful to have clean enough energy, and maintain or increase our use- but wouldn't it be more responsible to use less until that time that it has been developed and implemented? Sorry that this is a long comment!

{"cid": "UgySuPhIZOtOLjnmIvp4AaABAg", "text": "Interesting video but I feel you go over the alternatives too fast.\n\n\nNatural gas is around 50% cleaner than coal, replacing coal with natural gas absolutely makes sense, especially in developing countries where if we can switch the building of coal to natural gas plants we at least stem the tide of industrialisation. In the West this has already occurred, since most Western countries have switched from coal to natural gas as their main energy source. If we can at least push countries such as China and India into using natural gas over coal, we are making huge energy savings.\n\n\nCap and trade can work precisely because the government can effectively set climate goals. You're right that if we start with 10 units of carbon,  everybody gets 5 and one guy sells 4 to somebody who will use them, the problem will remain. However the government hands 2 or 3 carbon tokens to each person, you have dropped carbon production by 20-40%. Whilst it doesn't directly solve the problem, it gives the government a means of acting which it currently does not have.\n\n\nAs for Nuclear Power you missed the elephant in the room. The anti-nuclear lobby has indeed spewed out misinformation, but nuclear isn't currently viable because it's so ridiculously expensive to build nuclear power plants. The cost of producing electricity using nuclear costs roughly double what it would for coal and natural gas. So unless everybody is happy to double their monthly energy bills, it isn't likely to become a major energy source. Either we subsidise the entire industry to phase out non-nuclear and renewable energy sources, or we find some way of producing cheap nuclear energy, as right now it just isn't an economically viable option.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jon", "channel": "UCXrZongmOM1h1j6n-GU5y8w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRepoupzA1CvEQX_WcmseVZQ5GfFhy_vhQGDw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Replacing nuclear power plants with wind and solar will actually increase your carbon emissions. Yes, I said increase.\n\nThis is because, barring a preposterously large investment in batteries, they require you to install power plants which can be rapidly brought online and taken offline to make up for the variation in power production from these sources. Solar is particularly bad for this, since output drops off at basically the same time as you typically expect a sudden increase in demand (right around when many people are arriving home work, cooking supper, that sort of thing.)  The types of power plants that can be onlined and offlined at the speed necessary are almost all less efficient fossil-fuel based sources. The options that aren't fossil fuel based are either prohibitively expensive, or require very specific geography.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "ergohack", "channel": "UCHKThv1EMzeytUMmhcG2q-A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSvBjCkVRgj6oCGe40_k15q3P3JNfCG1NBP7Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Glad to see you approach this from a useful place; \"It's a thing, how do we deal with it?\" Because that's the discussion which needs to happen and has so much more depth.\n\nI've studied this subject since 2011, and I feel like you're pretty spot on for most of these issues. While certainly not a critique, I'd like to put in a word on Carbon Taxes vs Cap and Trade, and the Environmental Economist arguments. Cap and Trade can be effective, if there is a provision to decrease the cap (Side note: Excellent expansion of the analogy to international agreements, that's a connection I've not heard in 9 years of study!), but it depends on perfect knowledge of exactly how to efficiently bring down those emissions. Should we cut by 3% a year? 10%? Just a non-percentage value, like 100 megatonnes? \n\nTaxes simplify this by letting the markets work out the exact amount we cut down, (economically ideal solution, not necessarily environmentally ideal, tradeoffs :/ ) but require some idea of how much damage 1 ton of CO2 does. Does it \"hurt\" the world $10? $100? $10,000? (We call this the \"Social Cost of Carbon\")\n\nI'm rambling, and could go on about long-term discounting, or low-probability high-damages economics, but I'll stop! Despite the frequent setbacks, I remain optimistic that we can overcome this challenge.

{"cid": "UgwyYomF6DLNA3Yekp94AaABAg", "text": "I love your channel and always eagerly await new quality content.\nThat said there was a rather unfortunate turn in this video.\n\nOn nuclear power and how big of a role it should play in our future energy production I disagree with your conclusion but that I dont mind.\nJust to expand on that a little: Is Nuclear power better than fossil fuels in pretty much all regards? Yes, obviously it is and if we have to rely on some nuclear power for the foreseeable future until we hopefully find better solutions, so be it. However in my humble opinion it is not a sustainable long-term solution to all our energy-needs - at least not at the scales we are talking about. But okay we can disagree if Nuclear power should play more of a major or minor role going forward.\n\nI think what we can agree on is: There is not just gonna be one magic solution to all our problems connected to climate change. In the end, if we ever are going to find a working solution it will be a mix of a lot of things hopefully working together and contributing to a shared goal: Reduction of greenhouse-gases to Net-Zero (and beyond) - ideally eventually leading to a circular economy that is not based on the exploitation of limited resources.\n\n\nWhich brings me to my actual issue with this video: The maybe badly named concept of \"overpopulation\" which is thus swiftly dismissed\nTo be fair I havent seen the Michael Moore film you referred to but for now I will just trust you, that your portayal of it is rather faithful to the original context.\nFurther I will go with the assumption that population growth will plateau rather soon at 10 Billion people - Not much more (about 25%) than our current population.\nSo admittedly according to your portrayal the film kinda missed the point in that regard but you just picked out that one flaw in one arbitrary presentation (said film) to dismiss the whole concept and left it at that.\n\nSo the issue here is: The West is living on a rather luxurious standard of living - one that is rather wasteful at that without much concern for the environment. (Tbc: That is referring to incentives and mechanics of our economic systems not individual people and their choices).\nNow if the rest of the world wants to catch up to our standard of living we need the resources of 3-5 earths (including energy). Our way of living is just not sustainable.\nOf course the solution also cannot be to kill off 80% of the world population and implement a cap at 2 billion so we can maintain our wastefull standard of living but rather finding a better way.\nWhatever composition of solutions - with Nuclear power or without - we may employ: A big part of that has to be a massive reduction of [energy] consumption and waste. And remember we are not talking about the situation right now which is bad enough but about a world where the vast majority of population is trying to catch up to our wasteful standard of living. They may not grow much in numbers as you said - but are justifiably starting to demand their fair share of the limited resources. We have to start taking a good hard look how we can do that while lowering our footprint on the planet and where we have to take steps back. That may include reducing air travels to when it is absolutely nessessary - ending individual mobility (incl electric cars) and replacing it with efficient mass transportation, massively reducing meat consumption and so on. We have to be able to at least honestly talk about and discuss these things. Where can we reduce waste without sacrificing comfort and where might we have to make cuts and if so what of those things are so important to us that we rather take further steps in other areas?\n\nI get that you have to limit yourself to get a point across in a concise way that isnt boring everyone to death - unlike me incoherently rambling on forever.\nSo ofcourse you are not obligated to be the one to talk about all that in detail.\nI just find it a bit disturbing that you did dance around those points and then kinda dismissed all that by making up a strawman in form of that Michael Moore film without at least outlining the core problem here: Find a better descryption if you dont want to call it \"overpopulation\". That in a video for \"adults talking\" about Climate Policy.\n\nSo in conclusion: I was left a bit disappointed because I hold this channel in very high regards and thus apply much higher standards than usual (based on your past content). I am still looking forward to more excellent videos and maybe I get lucky and you do a follow-up to this one (So an even more Complete Moderate's Guide?)\nObviously I am rather passionate about this particular topic. I hope it didnt come across too harsh. :)\n\n\nEdit: Also seeing that Footballfield with Nuclear waste is really disheartening. That is pure misinformation and shouldnt be in any well-researched video. That is talking only about spent fuel which obviously you cant pack that tightly (that is obvious right?). Spent nuclear fuel still is highly radioactivem, emitts heat and thus has to be maintained properly. You cannot just throw it on a football field and be done with it.\nHowever that completely omitts the MUCH higher numbers in mid- to low-level nuclear waste - like cooling fluid and all the other stuff that inevitably comes into contact with nuclear material - all the way from mining to enrichment, nuclear reactors, maintanaince and eventually storage of waste. On top of that is lots of contaminated environment (water and soil). Wether or not that has any impact on your concern for nuclear waste doesnt matter.

The waste danger duration is the issue that will be arguably a bigger issue than figuring out how to build enough wind turbines and solar panels to replace at least coal and oil for power.

If someone is getting rich owning power plants then, just as with universities and hospitals, the market is screwing people over and producing worse outcomes to generate greater profits.

The nuclear waste quantity described is the sum total  waste product of commercial nuclear power running 20% of our power grid for the last 40 years.  Which is to say, you'd produce that much 'waste' every 8 years if we went to 100% nuclear and continue stored that waste as we currently do.\nI put 'waste' in quotation because of what goes into counting as 'waste'.  That is the mass of the spent nuclear fuel - which is the better term for it.  It is the better term because about 94% of what comes out of the reactor is the same as what went into the reactor.  The remaining 6% is about 2% plutonium and other trans-uranics, and about 4% burnt up uranium (and fissioned plutonium).  That 4% that was burned up is what gave us the energy.  \nWhich means that those 'spent' fuel rods contain about 24x the amount of energy inside them that we have extracted so far. Without mining another gram of uranium, we could run the entire US grid for around 200 years.   But more on that in a second.\nThat 4% burnt stuff produces radioactive fission products that are very hot, and thus burn up and become non-radioactive very fast.  The more radioactive things are, the faster they decay and thus the sooner they stabilize and STOP being radioactive.  This can be anywhere from hours or days of stability, to years or decades depending on which isotopes in question you're looking at.  The longest-lived radioactive isotopes of this part of the fuel are cesium-137 and strontium-90, which have half-lives of <30 years and thus become 'safe' (less radioactive than the ore we originally got the uranium from) in about 10 half-lives, or 300 years.  Not the shortest timespan, but also not terribly long -  it's quite a manageable duration, considering the concrete storage casks last for 70-100 years.  You can go up and hug those things, and a train, plane, or automobile crashing into them won't rupture them (they tested that to make sure transport would be safe).  So we just have to let them sit on a glorified parking lot for a couple repackaging cycles and they're done.\nThe other 2% is plutonium and americium mostly.  These are the things with half-lives measured in thousands or tens of thousands of years.  First, this means they're so non-radioactive that you  can tolerate being around them without too much issue.  As long as you don't EAT them you wouldn't suffer much damage from limited exposure.  Still, it'd be better to do away with these somehow.  For instance, we can bury it in a salt mine that's stayed dry and geologically stable for the last 2 million years, and probably will remain so for the next 10,000.  That's a viable option.\nSo the actual waste to power the country for 8 years doesn't fit in the area of a football field - it fits in just the endzone.  Of that endzone volume, 2/3rds of  it needs light attention for a few centuries - not ideal but nothing beyond our capability - and 1/3rd needs some kind of additional effort.\nOne other option than burying a fraction of the waste, or all of it, is to make breeder reactors.  Ie. Reactors with efficient enough neutron production that they can burn up ALL of the Uranium and Plutonium.  You would toss spent fuel into these reactors, and burn it ALL up. into those short-lived waste products to get energy.  That's where the 24x energy comes from.  No more long-lived plutonium needing to be stored - the plutonium would similarly be broken down into the <300 year stuff.   Now we don't need to bury things (though, we still could if we want to).  And the volume that we get every year is quite small.\nSo, to summarize - that football sized area illustrated is from running the entire country's electrical grid for 8 years (equivalently).  Only 4% of that is actual waste, and the remaining 96% could be used as fuel in a properly configured reactor to power our entire country for the next two centuries. (That 96% would, over time that, turn into the same stuff as that 4% and need to be watched for 300 years after production).  \nSo basically, our overall volume for waste is going to be 300 years worth of production - as at that time waste will be produced at the same rate it can just be tossed back into nature no more dangerous than when it was dug up.   So, take that football sized area 3 meters high, add +1.5 meters (50%) to move us from 200 years to 300 years of electricity, and then multiply that by 5 for good measure in terms of random inefficiency, expansion of electrical grid to cover transportation, increasing energy usage of society, etc.  And you've got a volume the area of a football field around 20 to 30 meters high.  And that's the final, steady-state volume of all of the nuclear waste to run the country perpetually.\nWhere oh where will we EVER find the space to store all of that in a tiny country the size of the USA?", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Xylos144", "channel": "UCGggq8QIQNAT6n6z-vaQYaw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQdCE1__uX3s-IoaxVnra3EYAnzXy8sLqN1=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyhElThHy8TIdXtlaN4AaABAg", "text": "Personally, from the limited research I've done and the one college class I've taken on the topic (Which yes I know doesn't make me an expert) I believe that nuclear can be used alongside energy sources such as solar and wind, using nuclear as a means of transition from one primary source of our energy being fossil fuels to an array of renewable energy sources that, as time goes on, subplants the infrastructure we have in place. Obviously we seriously need to do something NOW about emissions, but you still have to transfer our infrastructure from being based on gas and coal to one where renewable/sustainable (or at least more sustainable and way less harmful to the atmosphere) is widespread and nuclear energy can act as a clean, efficient and more widespread form of energy as that transition is made over probably at least the next decade and a half even if things go right for us and people can just pull their thumb out of their ass for a sec so we don't ruin the earth forever. \nI truly do believe there is some reason to be optimistic about some of the potential growth and changes can be as we make a transition to I guess you could say \"greener\" energy and so on, and I think nuclear is one of the most sustainable especially when compared to what we have in place now. People seriously need to see how far we have come in nuclear plants and nuclear energy technology, it's so much more efficient and safe that most people have any clue of and I think it would get a lot more widespread support if people advocated for it more.

Completely disingenuous, and China is about as trustworthy as North Korea when it comes to dealing with international organizations because they know the UN, et al, will do nothing. A single family home using incandescent lightbulbs, or a factory in Ohio not up to code, is literally nothing compared to how much China and India produce and I would not call them pre-industrial nations.\n\nI don't even understand how you can't see that a pollution credit system is an incredibly bad idea, not to mention a lot of the ways the Green New Deal would have to be implemented to be effective.

Clearly it wouldn't explain the whole of the warming, but it could explain some.\n\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, in high school my youth group would volunteer in urban areas like Royal Oak and Eastpointe, MI, and stay at a retreat house about 45 minutes away in the country.

The steam used to move the turbines has to condense at some point.

A lot of renewables have a quick return but it's never going to be enough to supply 300 millions plus people. The sun is not on at night when people come home to cook dinner and watch TV. And it's not windy everywhere. And we have not perfected an efficient battery system.\n\nAs for water management, we use a whole lot in agriculture, drinking and municipal services. It's the reason why states like Florida and California experience shortages in water supply. I live in Florida and no matter how many storms we get, we use up all that precipitation. From what I understand, the water used industrially is trumped by water used in agriculture. I don't think it would be an issue allocating enough water to harness energy.\n\nI think people need to redefine the term carbon free.

The difference (in the US at least) is that the whole country is so far to the right that they don't really remember what true \"far left\" actually is, and they use the term to describe people and ideas that are very firmly in the center by any non-American (or even historical American) measure.\nAnd of course that's somewhat by design.  People on average tend to shy away from both \"extremes.\"  But as they redefine \"extreme left\" more and more toward center, the new \"center\" also moves right.  At some point (if trends continue) we'll start defining moderate right as \"extreme left\" and over time the difference between the redefined extremes approaches zero and everyone ends up very near the extreme right.  I'm sure that sounds like paradise to those who are already on the extreme right but everyone else is sitting there shaking their heads at that statement as if I was insane.\nYet its been happening.  And continues to happen.  Reagan's policies for example were far more similar to Obama's than they were to Trump or even Bush2.  And its not because Reagan was a dirty communist leftie.  Its because Obama is actually center or even slightly center-right by any normal definition, but the media has simply changed the definition to portray Obama as \"far left\" and in doing so shifts the whole (perceived) spectrum to the right.

How does refrigeration =  emissions of a green house gas? If I intentionally leak CFC or HFC out an HVAC system it is a huge fine and I will lose my liscense. Most aerosol propellents are propane or co2 based. Yes some LARGE industrial HVAC systems are allowed to have minor leaks that mean that eventually they will need to be filled with refrigerant but it is NOTHING compared to other \"green house\" gases. A home HVAC unit has a charge of a dozen pound that will often last the lifetime of the system, some systems may need a top off after 10 years of a couple of pounds. Compare this to the methane off gassing of the muddy pond or wetland area behinds someone's house and we have a negligible effect. Some people hear green house gas and freak out. Well guess what swamps and wetlands produce methane which is one of strongest green house gases, should we get rid of those? What about the very worst green house gas(water)? Water molecules in the air are the number one green house gas should we stop the sun from hitting the ocean? Wait don't trees convert co2 to oxygen and water?

Meanwhile other less populous/smaller developing country as they have reached this theorethical cap, are forced to stagnate. This is the problem with capping. The next problem with trading, how much could you put a “value” on this carbon exchange? A developing country with huge rainforest such as Indonesia would love to get paid it Trillions of dollar, but those who are forced to pay this, would want to pay as little as possible. There’s also the problem of non-existent trade as the developed country is already under the cap and doesn’t need to pay (especially because they have the tech to do so) while developing country with older dirtier tech have no funds (as no one bought their carbon licenses) and even forced to pay because they are over the cap.

Think about a country that should be investing in power plants to meet the energy demands of a growing populace, or in manufacturing so that they can properly enter the global marketplace, and instead their leadership has sold all the carbon credits and agreed to allow the dumping of trash and/or hazardous waste in exchange for short term payments. \nNow you could say that \"that's capitalism,\" and you wouldn't be wrong to say so, but it's also DEFINITELY taking advantage of the ignorance and/or poverty of those less fortunate, and that IS wrong.

I think that overpopulation is an enormous issue that can't be talked about because our economic system is based on infinite growth and a declining population would tank the \"economy\". There is no way that the earth can \"sustain\" 10 or 12 billion people without accelerating our impact on the climate. Personally I think we need to start preparing to gradually reduce our (developed countries (highest per capita emissions)) standard of living and should seriously consider a replacement level child policy.\nI know that's considered sacrilege by most people because \"freedom\" but there is no infinite growth on a finite planet and we either gradually reduce our population or the climate will cull us instead. Humans weren't meant to live the ages we lived and people had more children in the past because of high child mortality rates and because childbirth was often fatal. We outsmarted our natural form with medicine and by creating our supply chains meaning we don't have to hunt for food or make possessions. So while having children is \"natural\" and people feel they have the right to pump out as many as they want, they are doing so in a world that we have created to prevent \"natural\" events from occurring. \n\nBut hey, all of this is hypothetical because convincing the average person to vote for a party to reduce their standard of living is laughable so I guess nuclear energy right?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "sutho", "channel": "UCtUz47u3yw2OazQ00L73a4Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSTinH0ARbHlZOqJjwfBXFbUJmpO_smOlqyBTm6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwBJad5Dy7HL7kkB7R4AaABAg", "text": "I feel like the rationale behind Cap and Trade has been presented a little \"unfairly\":\nFirst of all, it is a system designed to set incentives to reduce your emissions. Some firms have cheaper options than others for reducing their carbon footprint. By being able to trade the \"carbon credits\", a market price forms and \"determines\" which firms will sell their credits and which will buy some, namely those will sell who can reduce, say, 1 unit of emissions for cheaper than that market price of credit. Therefore, those firms with cheap reduction opportunities reduce first. The trick here is to set the amount of \"carbon credit\" just so that reduction HAS to happen: if you just hand out as much credit as your economy happens to blow out, nothing will happen obviously.\n\nSecond, if nothing changed after that, the situation would not become better, of course. However, the amount of carbon credit is reduced every period by the government. This could happen through simple collection of some of that credit, or (what would be more popular with most industries and therefore politically more viable) via the government buying credit back at market prices (or lower, if that could be enforced...): Point is, without the government regularly and rapidly reducing the amount of available carbon credit, this system would just be like you presented it: not doing anything! However, if a government would follow through with the system, this could contribute to the reduction of emissions.\nOf course, there are flaws with this approach: The actual production of emissions would have to be measured and non-compliance would have to be punished, which would add costs for enforcement. But honestly, so does every regulation. Also, the fact that by buying back carbon credit, you give those firms financial aid which have the hardest time reducing their carbon footprint, might in practice lead to financial support for the worst offenders when it comes to climate change, which might not sit right with activists. Also, when looking at actual real world attempts at introducing such a system like in the EU's case, the system failed because the amount of certificates (\"credit\") were not reduced over time. After every cheap measurement had been implemented, the amount of certified pollution and actual emissions about matched, which let their market price plummet. ALSO, the system contained legal loopholes, allowing firms to buy certificates and then write them off as lost profit and receive a tax cut WHICH OBVIOUSLY SHOULDN'T HAPPEN. Take-away here is, that it might be quite tricky to actually implement such a system.\nThis is also why I put \"unfairly\" in the first sentence: In theory, Cap and Trade can contribute a lot, in practice though it has not proved itself useful yet as far as I know.\n\nSo, yeah, long story short, I know that you cannot attribute a huge part of your video to such a minor detail, but I think, as I was here anyway, I could contribute my two cents to it. Cheers whoever actually read through this! Feel free to correct me on anything, I wrote mostly from memory and what I've learned in several courses over the years.\n\nP.S.: What I didn't mention: Such a system of course requires also harsh financial punishments for firms which do not comply with their carbon limits. These fines would have to be costly enough to make reductions worth it (in the long run). Otherwise, why reduce your emissions when the penalty is cheaper?", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "cocacraesh", "channel": "UCOUq-p3OLRDH-NZczzkq21w", "votes": "11", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBjTZ_KuKXb7rwPKbp6V96sjkaaj72dOFDdJd_=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Say for example Tesla buys up all of the carbon credits they can find.  Perhaps that pushes people to shift toward electric vehicles and battery-backed renewable farms.  Conveniently exactly the products Tesla sells.  (Not that Tesla is really large enough to do that on a significant scale, but just as an example.  And there are companies that are large enough to do so.)\nI'm more in favor of the carbon tax idea myself.  It certainly has problems as well, but its a much more balanced system (in the sense that companies know exactly how much they will pay per ton of CO2 whereas the C&T system makes it an open and therefore unpredictable market.)  The biggest problem though is that it doesn't actually cap carbon emissions -- companies can continue polluting as much as they want as long as they're willing to pay for it (which in turn just means passing the cost onto consumers.)  In the short term, the extra cost will drive companies to try and minimize carbon usage (so that they can keep prices lower than their competitors) but once that hits a new equilibrium point, a carbon tax just becomes another consumption tax and no longer has much environmental benefit.  Still, as the problem continues to creep up on us and we continue to ignore it, eventually short-term solutions are going to be the only remaining solutions because there will no longer be a long-term to worry about.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "altrag", "channel": "UCm_0o3zxowne95VLXEMIlOw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRqW0sTZMfqdQz0XSZrwDIcbYp_sDLO5x_8rg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyiVtvO39beP4jFfZB4AaABAg", "text": "You're definitely underrating solar energy. Solar power is now so cheap it's profitable to build solar farms in Scotland of all places, and only getting cheaper over time - whereas the cost of nuclear plants is pretty static and there isn't any political willpower to massively expand capacity. Nuclear is good for providing a baseline, sure, but solar is so cheap that it's almost enevitable to take over the grid just because of the economics of it. I also think you rushed over Cap and Trade - sure, the amount of carbon remains the same, but now polluters have to pay more to pollute which would drive energy companies to renewables if fossil fuels would not be profitable enough to offset the cost of buying the credits, which is what would happen since coal plants are barely profitable in the first place. Plus, the government would reduce the Cap over time if they wanted to reduce overall emissions. A carbon tax (which is just a different way to implement Cap and Trade) in the UK has caused the share of fossil fuels in the national grid to plummet.\n\nPretty good video though - Pandora's Promise is an excellent documentary. Props for calling out the implicitly pro-genocide overpopulation weirdos. I just feel that everyone's perception of renewables is lagging behind 10 years, and it's fustrating still seeing solar energy not being taken seriously even from well-meaning pro-climate people like you.

How much simply for the aluminum that the blades of a wind farm that is the same capacity is made from?\n\n\nI'll give you a hint, aluminum mining is roughly as polluting than uranium mining per weight of material, and a single wind turbine blade weighs as much as 2 years of uranium for a gigawatt plant, and it takes 333 wind turbines to make a gigawatt of capacity (which runs less than half the time, so you still have less usable power than a nuclear plant of the same capacity), and 3 blades per turbine means we're back to 1000, divided by 2 we have 500 times as much waste, just for the blades of the turbine vs the nuclear fuel for 100 years. Too bad the turbine won't last that long, making that 500 times worse obviously a very low estimate.\n\n\nYou get something similar with solar. Hydroelectric is very solid when we're talking about large scale dams, not so much when smaller systems. So yes, build the 2 more dams America has room for (it requires very specific geography, most places of which are already taken) while we're at it, but it won't be enough on it's own.\n\n\nThey're not safer. Hydro, if we ignore the several major accidents in China, maybe, but solar and wind both kill a few dozen people per year, verses the one person every few years of nuclear, and that's while nuclear is providing much more power than solar or wind.\n\n\nSolar and wind also have the problem of, when being used as the primary generation method, requiring absolutely shockingly high excess installed capacity's to keep up with demand when they're in a slump. This means look at the amount of power you think you need, factor of 10 it, then at least another times 4. That's what you actually need.\n\n\nAlso note, recycling creates a very large amount of waste. 1 gram of aluminum creates 6 grams of toxic waste during recycling, for example, and the rare metals in solar cells are radically worse still, which creates either a titanic consumption to maintain the replacement rate on solar/wind, or a titanic waste stream, which actually directly rivals coal in waste and pollution, which frankly is horrifying, because coal is diabolically bad. Interestingly, this actually means solar specifically creates more radioactive waste than nuclear by a factor of over 10,000, just like coal (if you didn't already know, in addition to every other problem, coal creates massive radioactive waste streams) for a given capacity.\n\n\nIt's not that solar makes that much radioactive waste, it's that people massively over predict how much nuclear makes. It's literally grams per year.\n\n\nShort recap: hydro, is very good, definitely make as much large scale dams as we can. Nuclear, literally the best in every way except hydro slightly edging it out in cost and safety (ignoring China's bizarrely bad track record of dam collapses killing thousands).\n\n\nSolar, produces thousands of times as much radioactive waste for a given capacity vs nuclear, and remember, you actually need 4 times + as much capacity of solar because it's down more than half the time, so even this crazy ratio is still not fair to nuclear. It also creates a large toxic waste stream if recycling is used, or requires a massive mining stream to replace the panels. Still, it is arguably better for small projects of limited scope, do to low initial costs, but it suffers badly in long term cost effectiveness, and it suffers catastrophically if it is depended on as the primary power source.\n\n\nWind, basically the same as solar but with noticeably larger mining requirements, meaning more long term pollution, with the sole benefit being no radioactive waste. Is more expensive to set up, much more limited area's to be constructed in, but could still be argued to be better for medium term medium sized projects vs nuclear.\n\n\nLong term power generation, nuclear wins by literally hundreds of times over in pollution, dozens of times in safety, and less than half the cost. It's very expensive in the short term, but once you factor in having to replace the solar/wind setup more than five times over the lifetime of the nuclear plant, literally outright multiplying their costs by 5, nuclear takes it easily. Long term, nuclear wins big, with the sole exception of large scale hydro, which as explained above, is strategically hard capped by geography.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "AS Deckard", "channel": "UCLzpEuZr6BduadXqbbN9hBg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQZWRji_A6-dmmhsWJGPiMhjyCyE0dD10H8yTpt=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They are not remotely as bad as you think. Nuclear plants do not explode like nuclear weapons. They don’t vaporize surrounding homes and permanently destroy the ecosystems around them. Most of the people who died from Chernobyl were first responders who got sick from radiation. The actual initial incident harmed very few people. Media alarmism over nuclear puts the image of a nuclear explosion into people’s heads. Nuclear plants don’t use technology that even enables that, you can’t just compare a plant to a bomb because they both use radioactive elements. They are incredibly different.

But PragerU is like the Fox News of Youtube, I'd say. Disproving them probably doesn't reach the people who normally watch it, assuming they tend to be older viewers, and I'd argue that their reputation as a politically driven, hack channel is well known. In the same way that people don't take CNN and Fox seriously, I don't believe most people take Steven Crowder, TYT, or PragerU seriously. I think finding more genuine content that just so happens to be right-wing would be better. Not channels necessarily pushing an agenda but channels approaching the issue from a conservative perspective who happen to be people trying to address the issue in a meaningful way. Even if they're wrong, if you can see them trying to approach the issue in good faith, wanting to help people, then I think they would be a good source to debate. In this way I hope we could heal some of this toxic outrage that always surfaces when people with different opinions find each other in the comments section. We should set an example by respecting each other, not demeaning one side because of their fools. Attacking PragerU is easy.

I would argue the answer is yes. (Not something I oppose, btw. $15 is $31,000/yr for a full-time employee.)\n\nRaising the minimum wage does have a trade-off, insofar as companies will raise prices to compensate. So while it’s dishonest of Rick Scott to say that “taxpayers” would be on the hook, he’s not exactly wrong. He just wants you to draw the wrong conclusion, i.e. that your taxes will go up as a direct result of that minimum wage increase.\n\nThen again, other taxes might increase slightly to compensate for depressed demand and reduced sales-tax revenue caused by price increases. It’s a balancing act. The only way to prevent possible price increases in the face of a minimum wage hike, is for the feds to outlaw them- a dubious prospect if there ever was one. Another option is for the feds to step up and pay the difference between the state minimum wage and the federal minimum wage, which would mean a tax increase at the federal level in order to prevent inflation or tax increases at state level.\n\nI only bring this up because all too often we say “just raise minimum wage!” without acknowledging that companies can and will raise prices. There is a cost to everything you do in regards to prices, wages, etc.\n\nThe ten-year time-frame seems arbitrary, but it’s a good round number that most people can understand.\n\nThe healthcare comments are indefensible though. We need single-payer healthcare already.\n\nI can’t get on board with your comments regarding wind and solar. Solar panels are designed to last between 20-30 years, and there are wind farms all over my state, and outside of the yokels down south complaining that wind turbines can read their dreams and are making them nauseous, there seems to be little reason not to use them. If the “waste” you’re talking about is from burning fossil fuels in the manufacture of solar panels and wind turbines, sure, but those processes will improve and change over time. Using these methods to generate power does not create any waste. The initial “investment” of fossil fuels burned to power the manufacture of these devices is fairly quickly recouped over their lifespan.\n\nNuclear power is fantastically dangerous if the waste is not handled properly.

{"cid": "Ugxinf_5SDQAvP89Ovl4AaABAg", "text": "Great piece, I have always loved well researched pieces like this, and I thoroughly believe that the best way to fight climate change is to get the US to follow the (rest) of the developed world. I don't know a lot about economics, but only will-fully ignorant people would argue that leading in any technology field is a goldmine, and that any country with the means to research emissions reductions.\n\n\nSee, I work for one of the seven sisters (what used to be the 7 largest westernised oil companies). I work with amongst other things to reduce CO2 emissions, as well as CO2 trading under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. So I feel I could help make two clarifications.\n\n\nFirst off, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS, or CCSU if you utilize it as well), is normally not one next to a factory as the CO2 concentration in the air is only like 0.04%. It's normally done on stacks (chimneys) themselves, as it is a lot more efficient, as the concantration is a lot higher.\n\n\nSecond off, cap and trade can easily be done in a way to reduce the overall CO2 emissions of a country/area. For instance in the EU in EU ETS Phase 3 (2013-2020) the emissions allowances are reduces about 22%, at least on all the refineries and oil fields I have worked with. So you apply for allowance allocation and based on your historic through put/emissions you get a certain allocation. Then every year you get fewer and fewer allowances. Which mean you have to buy more and more if you dont reduce your emissions. This will be more and more expensive, as allowances can only be bought from other companies so there is only a finite amount available. In the EU this meant that from 2013 to 2020 (before the corona virus) the price for emitting one ton of CO2 rose from about 5€/t to 25€/t. And if you at the end of a year dont have enough allowances you pay a fine of 10+ times the allowance price (or something like that, I forget exactly how it works right now). But the company still has to make up for any missed allowances the next year. \nThis means if you can reduce your emissions for let's say 40€/ton it's not going be done, but you will have to buy more allowances. But if someone else can reduce their emissions for 10€/ton then they will, and sell the abated emission allowances. If there are not enough available, the market price of allowances go up, and more projects will be viable, due to the cost of fines/allowances.\nOf course the corner stone of doing the cap and trade method, is to make surethe cap is set low enough to actually make a difference.\n\n\nI would also advocate for an addition CO2 tax, among other things.\n\n\nAll the money the EU make off the EU ETS goes into the Green Innovation fund (I think is the name, at least it is in Danish) which will at the end of 2020 start to more aggresively fund green research.

Take two masses if isotopes. 1 has a short half-life of arohbd a month, 2 has a long one of 200 years, and they both have the same amount of energy.\n\nIsotope 1 is very radioactive initially as it lets out half of it's energy in 1 month. But then half of it is gone, and the next month its output is half as much. Within 12 months, if it started at 200 times the background dose (a concerning level) , it will have dropped to less than half a percent of that initail dosage. So it drops the background radiation level very quickly. \n\nNow look at sample 2. Because its Halflife is 200 years, it emits that same dosage over 200 years.

It costs more to produce and maintain the energy in the powerplant, as well as maintaining the  powerplant, that it removes any economic incentive from cleaner energy (which is useful to convence people to switch to renewables). Another issue is that it takes up to decades to build one powerplant (takes longer to take one down), also accounting for the money and infrastructure to make the structure safe and deliver the energy. The main concern is how to transport and safely dispose of nuclear waste. I undertand that using other forms of nuclear material, other than uranium, can improve nuclear energy, but in a large scale it doesn't change much) The key to a sustainable future is utilizing various renewable resources, and implementing them in our daily lives, and establishing a network of co-dependence instead of a single powerplant delivering all the energy (which would also protect the US from an attack to our energy structure). Such implementations are also related to the geographical conditions of the place, how in the Midwest like in Wyoming wind power is better, and in Iceland the hydrogen produced by geothermal is widely used. The hydrogen collected can also be used as an alternative fuel for cars (Toyota made a car model using hydrogen, it's pretty cool how it works, you could go check that out)", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Springs S", "channel": "UCPCu0y9LgQQReoVN1r1U5wg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRiObvmFpPjSRS7kNWmdI0Mb1iJTWqqXOelsS-CZ1c=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

For wind the constant replacement like in the video and efficiency of it. And there’s only certain geographical locations it’d be really useful for. I feel nuclear has the most potential for costs to go down ( like it did for solar) with development and research in this field that hasn’t been really emphasized and pushed in the US. The building time is actually a pretty serious concern and would prove to be an obstacle. But nuclear is also the cleanest and most efficient out of these renewable sources that are being discussed. We’d also be able to use spent fuel rods like they do in other countries like France. So fuel wouldn’t be a big issue. Geothermal would be sick too, but they’re only very effective in certain locations. Obviously I feel that we need a all of these to accomplish our goal of not killing ourselves off the planet, but nuclear should do the plurality of the lifting.

The technology to make nuclear clearer could take years, and in those years and with that funding we could make a rapid change to renewables. The thing is that is complicated, we would have to integrate multiple ways in which to produce energy, like in our cars, roofs, sidewalks, etc, (which would also make the country safer from any attacks to the electrical grid, unlike the one present today that can be tracked to specific power plants). Different places have to adapt to which renewable is best for them, as well as implementing the use of biofuels from algae or plants like kudzu, that grow fast and extract carbon dioxide (it would be carbon neutral) we would also have to change the way in which we consume energy and transport (and the US system of energy and transportation in very old and decaying) It’s a joint effort with the government and the private sector (both businesses and citizens).

That's not to be cruel, but if you're broke, you can't afford a new TV. If the environment is broke, you can't afford more children. And if you're looking at climate change, deforestation and mass extincting, we're already getting deep into dept and it will catch up with us soon.\nSorry to say, but fulfilling your desires to have many children is just as selfish as fulfilling your desires to have a gas-guzzling SUV and eat beef all day.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sebastian Ganovich", "channel": "UCwXTK82JS0nUi2r77vv1Ehg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR2LaDnqFzisaEnMLSSYWTR0Td47iM8aNM1Iw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As a French with a different education/philosophy, I agree with like 95% of the content, the only point I disagree is overpopulation.\n-I think that overpopulation is a thing, not because we are simply too many, but because we consume too much, and if we want to come back to a sustainable level, even with all our current technology, we have to lose too much comfort to be \"acceptable\" by the mass (such as democracy as we know it, but it is another debate ^^).\n-I believe you think that overpopulation is not a thing because you make the archaic assumption that \"infinite growth\" is a thing, and if it is the case I can only advise you to read the book \"The limits to growth\" (or the Meadows curve).\n-In any case, overpopulation is not our 1st problem today, and our current ethics prevent a \"management\", and I am fine with that.\n-About nuclear power, I 100% agree on this point, just, I will add that \"dangerous nuclear wastes\" only stay on earth about 300 years, whereas CO2 stays in the air for thousands of years, and in opposition to nuclear wastes that we can safely store on a specific location, CO2 cannot be extracted from the atmosphere, which means the 1.5 °C objective is already lost, and won't be recovered during the 21st century, or even the 25th.\nThanks you ^^", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jigaraphale", "channel": "UCT7DiGlB9arltmf3vOHXiAQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTss3p-cW4TiFJiWomNipVTGf_lU06n_cKG4GDa4Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In middleschool (germany) I had a course for half a year that mainly focused on climate and the enviorment and energy. One of the first things we did was to watch an inconvinient truth and get educated about different energy sources. There we were told quite drasticly that the pushback against nuclear energy was one of the dumbest thing that the Modern Human did. But the bad thing is that this course was optional and in every other course like English and history where we would talk about these things it was always said that climate change is \"a theory\" and that Nuclear energy will kill us all if we dont shut it down. So its no wonder that this whole topic is fucked up when even the school doesnt seem to be on the same side. And even worse I remember that in History/Politics everyone needed to do a presentation in a small group about the dangers of overpopulation, so yeah of course many people that expierence similar stuff will think that overpopulation will be our downfall.

So we aren’t planting more trees, and our emissions are still going up. \n\nSo we aren’t actually doing anything, it just looks like we are if you only take into account some very creative accounting. And we did this for the Paris Agreement too. Oh, and we are still clearing land at a pretty big rate too. \n\nYou’d think that as the developed country that is the first to be hit by climate change in a very noticeable way, we’d care a bit more. I mean- we cared about the Ozone layer, because it’s rather close to where we are, it affects us. But climate change? Apparently not. But hey- we gotta make that number go up on the computer! That’s what really matters! 🙄\n\nAlso, the US is not the only country that has the debate- plenty of climate denial it’s in Australia as well.

Even if it was not real I think we would all benefit from keeping the planet cleaner. Your breakdown of the green new deal though was way too defensive of it. Its the very fact that it was not a serious proposal that makes it so aggravating. It was just virtue signaling at best. Its stated goals really were outrageous and impossible and they only reason it was created is to frame anyone who disagreed with it as climate change deniers and selfish people who don't care about the future of the planet. I don't think we should defend virtue signaling or political posturing with this issue. The actual writer of the bill (or at least biggest influencer) acknowledged that its actual main focus was to \"restructure the economy\". It had more about economic and social reform with a few unfeasible ideas about battling climate change. It is in no way worth defending. It also lacked common-sense reforms that actually would be good for climate change, for example, the best tool we have to remove carbon emissions is nuclear power, which the green new deal excluded as solution. Nuclear waste is minuscule and very easy to deal with compared to climate change, its also far more economically feasible. The green new deal put way too much of a focus on things like solar and wind power which actually have major issues with them. Whenever those sources stop procuring power they have to rely on coal or natural gas to pick up the slack. France increased their carbon emissions by trying to move from nuclear to solar and wind. In conclusion, as someone who normally likes what you have to say and someone who is not a climate change denier, you should be attacking things like that.

I'm certainly not an expert, but my degree is in engineering so take that with a grain of salt if you must.  Nuclear energy has a phenomenal track record, despite three HIGHLY publicized incidents, one of which was contained (Chernobyl) and a second created no lasting damage at all (TMI).  Chernobyl wasn't destroyed or shut down, the other reactor on site produced power for something like 30 years since the incident.  Even a melting reactor isn't an atomic bomb, it's not like TV.  \nAll energy production puts heat into the environment.  All energy transfer puts heat into the environment.  When you put food into your refrigerator it relocates the heat into your kitchen via the coils on the backside.  When you put dog poop and glass clippings into a mulch pile they create heat as they decompose.  Charging your cell phone, laptop, or electric car releases a bunch of heat from the battery and cables.  Driving a gasoline car releases a bunch more heat as a result of the inherent inefficiencies of that engine.  Converting the DC from solar into 60 Hz AC (50 for you weirdos ;p ) creates heat from the inversion process.  Friction from your tires on the road, from your shoes on the floor, from an airplane pushing through the air, they all create heat.  Simply having concrete or asphalt roads traps heat because it just re-radiates locally and creates \"heat island\" effects. \nElsewhere someone mentioned the aluminum needed for wind turbines - aluminum requires immense energy to refine from ore, more than most other materials.  That's the reason that it's so heavily recycled despite being very abundant in nature (bauxite). A real comparison, if you'd like to work the numbers for me and educate the rest of us, would be to compare the energy released as heat per energy released as electricity.

This is what is causing the issue in the first place. Once civilization is using that much energy, it won't matter that it's not due to greenhouse gases. It will still be added to the environment.

There was a company called  International Thorium Energy & Molten-Salt Technology who were going to build one, but they ran out of funds. Most of their R&D was taken over by another company (Thorium Tech Solution) but even they haven't built a reactor yet. In fact, while there is a lot of interest around the world in developing a working commercial Thorium MSR reactor and there have been plenty of plans developed, to the best of my knowledge there's no working modern Thorium MSR in existence - not even a prototype. \n\n\n\nThat's not to say it can't or won't happen, just that these plants DO NOT exist right now and there may still be unsolved technical issues that need to be resolved before they can be used commercially. Personally, I believe that Thorium MSRs may well become the solution for our long term energy needs and I fully support the idea of doing more research into that field and actually building more prototypes so solutions to the technical issues can be proven, but unless you're from the future, please don't talk as if all that's been resolved already.\n\n\nIn terms of Uranium reactors, there's effectively unlimited fuel available, but using current extraction methods there's only about 250 years worth of supply available in an economically viable way - at current consumption levels. If we were to ramp up nuclear power generation, that would also increase the amount of fuel used. For example, it's estimated the world's viable supply of Uranium would be consumed in just 50 years if only half of the world's electricity were supplied by uranium fueled plants.

The future needs of society will be many times higher than they are now. If we all push toward nuclear now, then this will lead to a path where the whole world builds more and more nuclear plants because of how cheap it will become. And when fusion technology comes, people will flock to that even faster, and there will be no stopping it. By being so cheap, nuclear energy will end up producing a significant percentage of the sun's rays.\nAlso, the hot water added into the oceans are already killing huge swaths of marine biology, and this imbalance to the marine habitat will have an even more devastating impact on the environment. I'm just saying we should push toward a solution that has no chance of backfiring down the road.\nTo be clear, I'm not saying we should avoid nuclear (if we can prevent marine habitats from being destroyed).

You can make them with Uranium, but you need to do the same amount of separation, if not more, and you need a lot more of it. There is a reason nobody builds Uranium gun weapons these days. The USA did it once and everyone who figured it out afterwards, didn't bother with that method. Even India, who used Uranium 233, didn't bother with another one. And commercial nuclear power plants produce the wrong kind of Plutonium to make effective nuclear weapons. Pu-240 is too unstable and spontaneously fissions. You need Pu-239 which is stable enough to be stored for use in a bomb, but doesn't exist for very long in the core of a commercial reactor. You would need to run the reactor for a short period, then extract most of the fuel (the reactor is offline for this) and insert new fuel, then repeat this process every few months, to extract the Pu-239 before it decays or transmutes into something else. Since nuclear power plants have uptimes measured in years, this simply doesn't happen. The benefit of nuclear power is that it stays online longer than anything else.\n\n2. The refining process for nuclear power - uranium enrichment - does not make those kinds of nuclear weapons possible. The reason being, is that you do not enrich uranium to anywhere near the level you need for a nuclear weapon. In terms of efficiency, nuclear weapons suck. Most of the nuclear fuel is actually blasted away before it ever has a chance to fission. So you need lots of it, which means you need a lot of Uranium which means everybody in the world who produces Uranium in the amounts needed, knows  what you're doing. This isn't The Avengers where Hydra is conjuring up high tech R&D labs in former Soviet Bloc states. You would be stopped before you ever got close.\nNuclear power in and of itself, IS a deterrent to proliferation.\n\n3. Dirty bombs are a hypothetical possibility that really has very little chance of happening in the USA or anywhere else. The reason we store nuclear waste in large concrete and steel casks weighing 50 tons or more, is primarily to contain the radiation. But it has the secondary effect of making it very difficult to move. 50 tons is 10 tons more than the max you're going to get on a semi truck without special permits. Meaning, if you have to pull permits to even get the DOT to let you put such a heavy thing on the road, you are damn sure not going to smash into a nuclear power plant, drop one of these things onto the trailer of a big rig (don't forget the giant crane you'd need to pick it up) and drive it down the road, evading every cop in the area and the national guard, who will be called out. It's a suicide run. Not happening. Also, the effectiveness of a dirty bomb follows the same sort of pattern we'd see in an accident like Chernobyl, just much smaller in scale. Sure you might poison a lot of people if you detonated it in Los Angeles or New York, but because you're not going to get much high level waste without killing yourself and because disbursing it is very hard to do, you're going to watch the bomb go off, poison several thousand people and then the effects fall off very quickly. If you detonated it in Los Angeles, by the time the fallout cloud hit Irvine, it would have largely dissipated. Nobody else is getting sick. \n\nStop dude. Just stop.

I'm not arguing the man wasn't elected. I'm arguing the election fell somewhat short of democratic ideals, seemingly by design. \n\n\n\nAlso, the comparison to the senate isn't really helping. Nor would a comparison to Congress. This might come as a shock to you, but the US isn't exactly the beacon of democracy it claims to be. All its electoral systems use outdated models with known severe flaws, and the politicians are bought so openly and excessively that they'd be... arrested, I think?... in most European countries. Certainly they'd be in flagrant violation of all kinds of laws meant to prevent corruption. And it shows in the laws that get passed, which track billionaire opinion way better than they track the opinion of the average voter. After all, the billionaires bought both sides, so what choice does that average voter have?\n\n\nYou can point out that it's the system, but \"this is the system\" doesn't work as a defence of that system.

Obviously greenhouse gasses are a factor but the earth goes through giant climate shifts throughout  its lifespan. Sea levels were once a lot higher than they are now if you read history of 7th-8th century England a lot of Lincolnshire was under water\\swamped. In the 16th century kent had an island and now it has a bridge. The Sahara desert used to be a rainforest then a savanna now it's a dessert. It baffles me how these \"climate scientists\" ignore the concrete fact that this naturally happens. I'm not trying to convince anyone just stop giving the government more power.

Big businesses tend to not care about climate change because their business depends on destroying the climate and they obviously are choosing their fiscal empire over the future of our world. \n\nSo if you are honestly okay with possibly destroying the world while you’re still alive, and 100% destroying it for the future generation, then you can fuss over who is voting for it. But realize how insane and extremist YOU sound by even going there lol. The green deal IS one of the better strategies to make earth remain habitable and safe for us to live in. If you can’t deal with the idea that you might be agreeing with a different political party for the sake of the planet, your family, loved ones, and the children of the future... you’re an idiot and on par with religious extremists, and probably the “far leftists” in terms of other extreme views you despise.\n\nThink for yourself.

As for the numbers for replacables... I used to have those handy, though I forget the details. I do remember I got a bit pessimistic after doing the calculations.\n\nThe summary was that while we can easily scale up wind, wind shadow means that you hit diminishing returns quite quickly in any single location, and in densely populated areas (I was calculating for the Netherlands), you run out of wind before you've provided everyone with energy (or come close iirc). Conversely, while there is easily enough sunlight to power even densely populated dimly-lit countries like the Netherlands, solar cells are made of way more high-tech materials than windmills, and you're going to need on the order of thousands of square kilometres of the stuff worldwide, replaced every 20 years. \n\nThat means about a tenfold increase in dedicated high-tech production capacity, assuming global energy demand doesn't grow (it will, and must, for developing nations to reach our level of prosperity). In addition to that, those high-tech cells will turn into high-tech waste, contaminated with heavy metals, which will need but likely often not receive reprocessing. \n\nThen, regarding the time to build a nuclear plant... yes, they take a long time to build, but what takes even longer is getting through the people saying they're a bad solution. Al Gore lost in 2000. Any plants we'd have started planning then would be operational now. And in 2040, this problem still won't be solved, and the argument against nuclear will still be it takes too long. \"It will take too long\" is a terrible reason not to start, as any self-aware procrastinator can confirm.\n\nFinally, while renewables promise to maybe, in the best case scenario, promise to eventually slow carbon emissions to a halt, nuclear (and afaik only nuclear) promises such an abundance of energy that we should be able to afford the energy-intensive process of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere, not just stopping global warming but reversing it, which means that even if it takes longer, it might leave us with less CO2 in the end.\n\n\nEdit: paragraph spacing.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Sal Wolffs", "channel": "UC_SRKepxfG0bmM3BdxbsbzA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQXOHZvSiNlKH_ARZJYV381JxYWe5b6_NqjuATR=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We'll be lucky to make it in 25, and on that timescale, nuclear suddenly becomes one of the faster options, because while it has high latency (i.e. delay between planning and operation), it has great throughput: those reactors that take so long to build produce such tremendous amounts of energy that the moment they come online, they immediately overtake all the renewables that have been coming online every year during their construction.\n\n\nThat said, we should probably be doing both, because even if renewables can't completely free us from fossil in time, they can help us stretch what carbon budget we have left until new nuclear reactors can be completed in sufficient quantity to finally solve the issue.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sal Wolffs", "channel": "UC_SRKepxfG0bmM3BdxbsbzA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQXOHZvSiNlKH_ARZJYV381JxYWe5b6_NqjuATR=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwUJSNAKZ5X26zyosd4AaABAg.98-tgd6qEfs9809iTzArej", "text": "To add to what Sampat said, the US government is designed to work via Committee and Consensus. Parliamentary Systems accept partisanship as a reality of politics and are thus structured to give a majority party as much power as possible (without being too dangerous) to enact their vision of policy for the next four or five years. Presidential Systems, though, are structured so that parties must come to agreements or compromises on issues. Committees are created when people have ideas, consisting of members from both parties, who explore an issue and policy, then present their findings to both of their party leaders, stating they have the support of members of the other party who are on this committee, and so the bill proceeds to more formal debate in the floor of congress. Bills formed this way succeed far more often than not, and the Clean Water Act was one such bill-by-committee. When these agreements can't be attained, dealmaking is another option. Trading agricultural subsidies for tariffs.\n\n\nSo when that polarization hits, these committees aren't created or aren't as successful, and the Presidential System breaks down. France avoids this by having constitutional measures designed to prevent party polarization, so they can still have a Presidential System that's effective. Perhaps the saddest example of the death of Committe and Consensus Government was the 1990s immigration reform. This was several years in the making, and was led by one of the greatest statecrafters of the modern age, Representative Barbara Jordan. It intended to completely overhaul visa distribution, streamline asylum application, tighten security, and support the immigration courts, all to make legal immigration easier and more permissive, while at the same time resting fears of illegal immigration without resorting to police state tactics. It fell through, though. Expanding legal immigration was smeared as a plot to depress wages or import mexico wholesale. The immigration reform collapsed and the committee disbanded in 1996. Those fears went uncalmed. The issue went unresolved. The immigration courts remained strained and unfair. Exactly 20 years later, Donald Trump would be elected on a mandate to curb illegal immigration.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Elijah Robinson", "channel": "UCgCAVBV1VDiqtKYjcR0Cf-w", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQz_faWhMa6XjOKYvM-DDcThSYxV0oqgP8JEzB0zw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
