{"cid": "Ugw1Cjh_oPnn5EKDoy94AaABAg", "text": "Wake up everybody! In 2 years all hell begins! I am very concern and all of you should be too! We just had a meeting of our world leaders and NO ONE has put forward a plan to end global warming that would end global warming! All talk and no action! All of you folks don't have a clue on what to do to end global warming! And if we don't do something immediately then in 2023 our nightmares begin for in 2023 we will be entering a whole new climate era, a climate era where there will be no more winters as we have known them, that is unless you do what I say. And I am telling you the truth! The people of the world ae not set up for what is going to happen in 2023 and ALL OF YOU don't understand or comprehend all that you will face come 2023 and thereafter. President Biden and his administration totally ignore me in every way. They don't take my calls or answer my questions to them so I ask you too the same questions. Just what are you folks going to do to end global warming? What are you going to do come 2023 when there will be no more snow or very little snow in most areas of the planet during the 2 months of winter we will have around the planet where you live? The rest of the year you will be getting rain only because it will be too warm all over the planet because in 2023 there will be very little or no more cold ice in the waters in the oceans and water ways of the North Pole. Hot air like Arizona or Florida will progress it's way up North as the heat molecules of the planet overpowers the cold molecules of the planet. The last time the Earth was without ice and snow the warmed of the planet extended all the way up into the North Pole and South Pole! The hot Sun shining all day for six months a year on the North Pole and then the South Pole for six months will make our air and water of our Earth warmer. We have to immediately shut down all sources of heat entering our atmosphere so that we can survive on a warmer planet with a warmer environment! We either do it right or the Sun will take over our atmosphere and destroy it!  \r\n     You see folks, our atmosphere is really a game of chemistry between the hot and cold molecules. We humans have tipped the scale in favor of adding to more hot molecules to our environment and taken away more cold molecules with our melting of the ice on our planet. This is the main reason we have global warming. Since the beginning of Earth the planet always had an atmosphere that created clouds and rain which are the most important ingredients on Earth that enables there to be life on Earth. Without clouds and rain there would be no life on Earth!        \r\n   I am scared that all of you don't understand why it is important that all of us must immediately stop flying rockets of all kinds and jet planes of all kinds. Think about this, rockets and jet planes are the only extremely hot things we humans put into the atmosphere above say 3 hundred  yards or more. Heat coming out of smokestacks are about the tallest things we humans have that emit extreme heat or pollutants. \r\n     However jet planes and rockets are the ONLY things we humans put up into our atmosphere that is taller than a smokestack and very hot and very polluting! Rockets leave our planet on a burst of ignited extremely hot gasses and extremely polluting exhaust. These rockets leave our planet and for miles into our atmosphere they emit extremely hot temperatures and many pollutants. Rockets exhaust temperature is around 5800 degrees. The Space Shuttle was as hot as the Sun! There has been 5038 rockets launched so far and we are still counting! This extremely hot rocket heat is mixed into a temperature entering our atmosphere that use to be always around 32 degrees in the area where clouds are formed. However rocket heat and jet plane's heat from their exhaust has increased the temperature of our atmosphere from the clouds and above. As this daily amount of heat and pollutants are added to out atmosphere over time our atmosphere starts to produce less molecules that produce clouds and rain.\r\n    Once there is less clouds there is more heat entering our atmosphere from the hot rays of the Sun which increases the temperature of our planet. Once there is less rain there is less cleaning of our atmosphere from rain. Rain is Earth's air cleaning system. Rain has been cleaning our atmosphere for millions of years in times 20 times worse than what we have today. When super volcanoes erupt the ash can cloud out the Sun for decades and more. Heck our ice ages probably came about from super volcano eruptions. But in the past the Earth didn't have pollutants in the atmosphere that stopped clouds and rain from forming. Now we do.\r\n    Now jet planes are a big environmental problem just like rockets. Jet planes are gigantic travelling vacuum machines and also a very hot traveling furnishes and very polluting machine. Jets exhaust temperature ranges from 800 degrees to 1200 degrees for passenger jets and from 1200 to 2500 degrees for military jets. We have about 120,000 of these military and passenger jets flying around our atmosphere EVERY DAY sucking up and burning up and polluting our whole atmosphere around the planet! This heat from jets and rockets has increased our planet's temperature more than any other thing we do! This heat from rockets and jets mixes with that colder air from outer space and warms it up above the 32 degrees temperature. this causes Mother Nature to not be able to produce clouds as much as it normally would. Heat dries up humidity and creates low atmospheric moisture and clouds need high amount of humidity and precipitation to produce clouds. Our atmosphere has a system whereas the cold from outer space meets up with the air from all that is happening on the ground and mixes together in our atmosphere. If there is ice or snow on the ground in any parts of the world it will affect what happens in our atmosphere. Less ice and snow on the ground and the planet warms easier from the hot rays of the Sun that shines about 12 hours a day. However in the North and South Poles the Sun shines 24 hours a day for about 6 months and then total darkness for 6 months. This causes things to happen. The Earth has been in an Ice Age for a long time now. We had massive amounts of ice in the North and South Pole as well as glaciers and mountain tops all over the world. However we are now at the end of the Ice Age. In 2023 the North Pole's ice in the waters of the North Pole during summers will be either no more or very little. As the warmer waters travel the waters of the world and reaches the South Pole area more so than now the South Pole in about 2024 will start to lose ice in much greater pace than now which will lead to the South Pole's ice to start falling apart a lot. This will lead to a disaster world wide of floods from rising waters. After decades of this abuse of our planet Earth has reached it's breaking point as we move into near 2023. For 2023 will be the first year that there most likely will be no more ice in the waters of the North Pole during the summer. That means that the Ice Age is over and the Earth is onto a whole new climate era that as we are living now we will not survive.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Ron McCune", "channel": "UC2i3RrOGN7THKJUlxEv4uVQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShUNr46hIBIYGYynj28AQAJG7I9cjBJVyhcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Can the monoculture known as modern civilization be sensibly considered as a global cult because so many culturally sanctioned and widely shared memes lack a sufficient reality orientation and are bereft of compelling, objective scientific evidence? Cultures are cultural transmission generators. A cultural transmission or meme is a perception, value or belief that spreads virally among people who find favor in its content. Thanks to sound science, a culture presents us with many memes that are reality oriented or based upon objective, compelling evidence. But other memes that are delusory are also promulgated. From a psychological standpoint, because humans are shaped early and pervasively by memes in learning to perceive reality, it is an evolutionary challenge for humankind to see the world as it is. In the early days of a human being's life memes are deeply impressed into the young mind and set in place there years before the child has developed the intellectual capacity to objectively examine and critically question what has been transmitted by ones parents, caretakers and teachers by language and example. Individuals are who we are in large part before acquiring the cognitive capabilities to examine our culture and its widely shared, false memes. Fatally flawed memes occasionally exert more influence over the conduct of human affairs than objective correlates derived from science. https://countercurrents.org/2021/06/human-population-activity-the-primary-factor-that-has-precipitated-a-climate-emergency-biodiversity-loss-and-environmental-pollution-on-our-watch/", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Steven Salmony", "channel": "UCpkzRq29a-OIuOZ5zxvlv_g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRYaTlryhHHwTrnaGRgx_HVxM70CYtoHPhi=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We don't want to find solutions to save the planet, we want solutions to save our way of life. And our way of life is, first of all, wrong. This wrong way of life is what brought us here, on the edge of collapse. Finding solutions should begin from correctly identifying the problems. Only to not have a too long comment, I would say only this: on average, it takes 25 calories from plants to produce 1 calorie of meat. This means that every single human individual consuming (on average) 2300kcal/ day, throws away 55,200kcal every single day. We should consume meat three times a month and not three times  a day. Yes, we do not consume only meat, but our livestock consumes food produced on the land where we could (and we should) rise our own plant based foods. Now add to that the fact that we kill about 200 million animals (wild ones and fish NOT included) every single day. The conclusion is simple and obvious: the rise in human population is far from being a problem. The real problem is that we waste the food for 24 times the population.", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Stefan M", "channel": "UC2r4zkaO0JtLO6fqsCJw6cg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLThILbR8gD1S3UHXCfCWJ7TUc3ge8pC6XrTfQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx6T0EzeEEhYU0Dv_54AaABAg", "text": "A beautiful thought and vision but the odds of us turning this all around - not likely. As a matter of fact, most likely too late. Because of the problem we humans have always had - greed. Greed is the route of all suffering. Look at Greta Thunberg, the most important person on this planet. Her message is solid and people are listening, because she is basically a child and speaking for all children. We have fubared the planet and they are pissed, as they should be. But realistically, what have the 1 percenters, politicians, and huge corporations done to make positive change? Not much. Nothing. Because there is nothing in it for them, why would they? We have done several good things as a population - solar energy, windmills, people have gone vegan etc etc but it is not enough. We are pretty much in the midst of irreversible climate change which means that we are past the point of return. That of course is up for debate but I have done research on the internet for years now. That research has not come up with much if any good news. What is the solution then? Things have to get worse before they get better. We are already seeing several negative impacts because of global warming but still people deny, even while there is mass suffering and the beginnings of starvation because of it. People will not enact change until it starts impacting them personally. Therein lies the problem, we are living in bubbles. Change will not occur until our way of life (the rich and privileged) are threatened. We are a selfish species. Then, and only then the greatest minds will unite and try to find ways to 1. solve the environmental problems and 2. Find a way for a handful of us to actually exist and survive. But alas, it is probably too late. I wonder if other species on other planets found a way to survive past their industrial revolutions. Sadly, we'll probably never know and future civilizations won't either.

You’ll save one pound of carbon dioxide every mile you don’t drive!\n\nRecycle more \nYou can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year by recycling just half of your household waste.\n\nCheck your tires\nKeeping your tires inflated properly can improve your gas mileage by more than 3 percent. Every gallon of gasoline save keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\n\nUse less hot water \nIt takes a lot of energy to heat water. Use less hot water by taking shorter and cooler shower and your clothes in cold water instead of hot water (more than 500 pounds of carbon dioxide saves per year)\n\nAvoid products with a lot of packaging \nYou can save 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide if you reduce your garbage by 10 percent\n\nAdjust your thermostat \nMoving your thermostat down just 2 degrees in winter and up 2 degrees in summer could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.\n\nPlant a tree \nA single tree will absorb one ton  of carbon dioxide over its lifetime \n\nTurn off electronic devises \nSimply turn off your tv, DVD player, stereo, and computer, when your not using them, will save you a thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide a year", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Kk", "channel": "UCq3rIV7T7q4Z3NCRXIBOT8w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS0z--H2U141MCM-NFjKRfgtT9eRK7TbptCAZHObw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyM6RiZ-BfftaZmBlN4AaABAg", "text": "Earth Day... countdown to DEATH DAY! As the world stands in ignorance as the end of life on Earth in 20 years stares at it from the Sun whose history has shown that it can coble up any planet all the people ponder on what to do. As the Ice Age ends in 2023 as no more summer ice floats in Arctic's oceans due to Russia's attempts to warm up their whole country every year with multiple military maneuvers across their whole country that added much warmed to their area of the Earth which caused the weakest ice on Earth, permafrost, to melt and flow into the oceans in the Arctic. This permafrost melting water entering the oceans has been going on since the 1950's when humans started flying jet engine planes instead of propeller planes. Also humans in the 1950's started using rockets. Today we are shooting up rockets every week and flying over 100,000 military and passenger jets a day worldwide everyday! The heat of the rockets exhaust ranged as hot as the SUN for the SPACE SHUTTLE and around 5800 F for rockets. Jets are gigantic vacuum and heating machines that sucking up our molecules in our atmosphere which the planet needs to create keep Earth's washing machine and water maker running which are clouds and rain.\n The warmer waters from melted ice from the poles travel around the globe and  as they melt the South Pole's ice in 2025 it will begin to collapse in mass. Then waters throughout the world will flood the low lying areas of the planet. People will drown and nuclear plants will be destroyed and it's radioactive waste polluting the world's oceans and water ways. Civilization will collapse as everyone and every animal thereafter will forever have to scramble for water and food. This is your world starting in 2023 when the North Pole has no more summer ice. The Earth will quickly progress from one disaster after another as tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts and rainstorms travel around the world causing havoc. Volcano eruptions will happen numerously as water enters the Earth and turns up the tea pot pressure on volcanoes worldwide. Once the cloud system disappears in about 2030 due to not enough trees to provide what nature needs to make clouds then the Sun will bake and evaporate all the water from the Earth within years. \n   You can stop it if EVERYONE stops flying jet planes and rockets of ALL kinds. Then we have to stop using combustion engine machines of all kinds, end fracking, repair leaking gas wells and more which I will soon write about. Also very important that we do all we can now to save all the ice in the North and South Poles. We will do this by collecting all the melted water from melted ice in the poles whenever possible, wherever possible and refreeze the water in the winter months. We will turn return the then refrozen ice to the valleys of the poles where we will layer it in hanging sheets over all the ice in the North and South Poles. WE will chop up and anchor large detached icebergs back onto the mountain ridges where they will stay to cool the waters. We can also redo all our dwellings with this thing called 'Cool Walls which will cool and heat all our dwellings. We could also equip all our homes with this new gadget that takes hot air out of a room. Install these in all homes and we will use less air-conditioning. Also there is this new paint out called Super White Paint I believe. When a dwelling is painted with this paint the Sun's rays are reflected off the dwelling which keeps the building cooler along withy the environment. Then we have to shade the south side of our dwellings as much as possible to keep the hot Sun rays off the dwelling during the summer time. Shade the walls as well as the roofs. DO IT OR DIE!

{"cid": "UgyXPgEreYJV3r00h9x4AaABAg", "text": "I wrote a speech and a poem.\n\nOur world so rich in diversity \r\nSo beautiful and complex\r\nYet it is wasting away\r\n\r\nOrangutans left homeless\r\nAnd fish stuck in plastic bags\r\nAnimals are dying because of our selfish actions\r\n\r\nWe cannot waste away this\r\nBeautiful environment\r\nWe need to take action\r\nTo save, and sustain our\r\nPlanet\r\n\r\nWe should be stewards\r\nIt is us who can take action\r\nAnd it is us who can make a change\r\n\r\nDon’t litter, think about our ocean\r\nMarine life dying, engulfed in plastic\r\nMake a change, act now, so we can \r\nSave our planet. Otherwise there is\r\nNo hope.\r\n\n\nGood Morning,\r\nToday I would like to discuss with you how we can contribute to protecting our planet. I am sure that we can agree that  we should take responsibility for our actions, and how we could impact the sustainability of the environment. If we do not start to action, millions and millions of lives will be lost!\r\nDid you know that 9.1 million acres of trees have been lost because of deforestation? Doctor Jones, the well known scientist, believes that there are more than a trillion pieces of macro and micro plastic in our ocean. And with that, hundreds of thousands of seagulls and marine life die everyday because we take our oceans for granted. I’m sure that we can agree that, if we start to take action, we could potentially save our planet, and the creatures who suffer as a result of our selfishness.\r\nWe can clearly see the impact of pollution in our cities. Children in London and Birmingham are developing asthma at a very young age because we reject responsibility for polluting the environment. Do people not care about the consequences of their selfish actions?\r\nSome people may argue that our impact on the environment does not matter because there will be people who continue to selfishly pollute it. People will continue to use fossil fuels irresponsibly, and pollute lakes and oceans with waste. This isn’t the point, though. If those who care will take personal action for our planet, hopefully other people will be influenced to do the same. \r\nTo impact the sustainability of our planet we need to stop using non-biodegradable products and palm oil. And hope that people will continue to contribute to helping the environment. We need to make a difference now; before it’s too late.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "Levi Ackerman", "channel": "UCQnLNUdY5lCd-SfPd_RS_yA", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT7OKBYBaZ2NaR2746OS0bKLEs0_lTEkJO_D0Q9qQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw8KXOCmZ-VXpQJLux4AaABAg", "text": "Sir David Attenborough has said that reforesting our lands and feeding our populations with better food using modern technology is the best solution for ourselves and our planet. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/c3bdUk4qa0Y\n\nMany people have believed the carbon dioxide demon when the truth is quite evidently right in front of their eyes. The stripping of forests for plantations and habitats has changed the climate. \n\nThe planet’s climate has been controlled by life forms for 3 billion years as seen by earths carbon dioxide level of a mere 0.04% against our two neighbours mars and Venus that have 90%+ carbon dioxide. The burgeoning human population struggled to feed its own with grains that caused forests that bound soils and moisture to be ripped up and replaced with dry fields with no topsoil retention. So plant life’s grip on the climate was weakened and the climate shifted slightly. \n\nThe solution is to return the forests and feed the population at the same time. New plant factories in the Netherlands (53°N) are able to compete with agriculture in the tropics to produce our food in a fraction of the space and with a fraction of the water required by conventional agriculture.\n\nBuild plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\nUse cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\nUse goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\nUse agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\nUse marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\nUse minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nDon’t be misanthropic. Be positive. Be useful. Help flora and fauna control climate and don’t demonise plant food (carbon dioxide).\n\nIt’s now possible with plant factories to make a country like Britain self-sufficient in food and return its arable land to forests.

If you liked this video, check out this presentation:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP83Qz6TabM \n\nThe 6 things every individual can do to save the Earth:\n1.  Go VEGAN (food, clothes, accessories, toiletries, furniture etc.)\n2.  Consume products LESS and become an INFORMED consumer.  \n   -  Don't buy anything new (except if necessary, like medicine or contact lenses).  You can buy basically everything USED or make it yourself.  \n   -  Do your RESEARCH before buying anything.  Many products are destroying the environment via the extraction of raw materials, the production process, transportation etc.  Also production lines are full of human labor abuses.  Do your RESEARCH if you must buy something.  Remember, your purchase of a product acts to support that company and everything that went into that product.\n   - If you don't know 100% how a product was made at each and every step, then do NOT buy the product.  You could be unknowingly supporting the extinction of orangutans in Indonesia (ex. palm oil) or the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (ex. beef).  No joke.  Stop buying products unless you are 100% informed.  Don't be selfish.  You  don't need most products.  Buy it used at eBay/Craigslist/Goodwill or make it yourself instead of contributing to the destruction of the planet.\n   - Stop buying via Amazon.  It has rampant human rights abuses that have been clearly reported on many times, including abuses during COVID-19.  In addition, despite some of its 'climate pledges', Amazon has a terrible negative impact on the environment.  Think factories, energy-usages, packing for all of those boxes, carbon emissions fo r the trucks that deliver them etc.  If you buy via Amazon you are supporting human rights abuses and environmental degradation.  Do you really need that product?  Just buy it used or at least directly form the actual company.  Don't be selfish, be responsible.\n3.  Go plastic and packaging free.  Don't buy anything with non-compostable packaging, or that's made of non-environmental material.  If you do, make sure it's recyclable and recycle it properly.\n4.  ADOPT and REDUCE family sizes.  Humans have overpopulated the world and are destroying the environment as a result.  The human population is almost at 8 billion.  We need to intelligently and voluntarily work to get our numbers down to at least half of that.  It is a very personal issue, but please consider adopting children instead of creating new children.  If having biological children, consider smaller family sizes.  \n   - Donate money and/or volunteer at organizations that support women's rights and literacy.  On average, women's illiteracy rates are inverse to the number of children they have.  I.e. the number of children a woman has decreases as she becomes literate and more educated.  Here are some ideas:  Room to Read, World Literacy Foundation, Malala Fund, UNICEF, Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED), Afghan Institute of Learning, Invest in Girls, Educate Girls, AGE Africa, Asante Africa Foundation, She’s the First, Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE).\n5. VOTE and become politically informed.  Make sure to stay politically informed and pressure your local, state and national representatives to support issues and legislation that save and protect the environment and species.  VOTE during elections.\n6. Use only RENEWABLE energy and use LESS of it.  \n   - Buy carbon offsets from a reliable company for your yearly energy usage.\n   - Stop flying unless absolutely necessary (and buy carbon offsets if you do).  Walk, bike, ride a velomobile, use public transportation instead of gas-powered cars.\n   - See if your energy company has an option for you to buy green energy or support green energy initiatives.\n   - Install your own renewable energy sources, like solar panels.\n   - Be conscious throughout your day and use as little energy as possible.  Ex. instead of turning on the heat, just wear a few more layers and close the windows.\n\nWe can save the planet if everyone just does their part.

{"cid": "Ugz8wyEX8Zm1Na6gJHB4AaABAg", "text": "Yes indeed, it is simple. And how we got to this point is by over breeding. In order to create harmony we need balance. A balance between nature and humans. Right now the scale is heavily weighted to the humans. There are over 7 billion of us. Every single one consuming and polluting. Every single one of us using resources that in many cases are irreplaceable. We have gotten to the point now that our sheer numbers are affecting the weather. Our factories, vehicles and pretty much everything that makes the things we require, use vast resources and energies creating even vaster amounts of pollution that have now spread to every corner of the earth. Creating havoc in nature. Heavy metals are now being found in even the most isolated of peoples. These are the by-products of industry. Now don't get me wrong. I like industry. I like my car and my things. I would never want to live in a pre-industrial age. but for every human, there is a price. The price of keeping that human alive. Feeding, clothing , educating, sustaining and hopefully letting that human have a life wanting, well, almost nothing.  Too many of us. It's pretty obvious, really. Think about it. If everyone of us is essentially part of the problem, then who is the solution? Nobody? Hmmm. I think the solution, and yes it will take years, many years, is too limit the number of children to one per couple for the next 150 or so years. However long it takes to get our population down to say 4 billion. At that number, it's not like we'd be about to go extinct but I think the environment would have abetter chance at surviving and dealing with the human consequences. I know China tried it but they gave up decades early. India never did and look at that mess. Rampant starvation, water that you can't drink, Air that you can't breath. Is that what we want for the future? People rail about plastic. There supposedly is a floating plastic continent in the Pacific ocean. I can't say if it's true but the very concept is deeply disturbing. People just chuck anything that they don't want anymore away. Too many people. My advice, after you and your spouse have had a child, get the 2 of you sterilized.

Am here to tell all of you herpes has been plaguing my family for a long time, I lost both parents to herpes and it is so painful because I have the disease too. I couldn't get over it. As we all know medically, there is no solution or cure for herpes. Until one day I read an Online commentary on how a particular doctor called MOHAMMED cured a lady named Judith on how this powerful doctor who helped her cure my comrade's disease (herpes) beloved to whom I first taught, with the help of an African doctor was a bad idea, but I thought to these \"will I keep pushing these diseases to the end? the day I have someone to help save my life? \" so i gathered all my beliefs and interest to contact him through his email address at (EMAIL; herbalcure12@gmail.com) so after i emailed him i told him i had needed his herpes remedy and he answered me so quickly that I shouldn't worry anymore that he is sending me a herbal medicine that I will take for 3 weeks. After ordering his herbal medicine, he sent it to me via DHL, which was delivered to me within 4 days of ordering. He gave me the instructions on how I will use them and told me that I would be completely healed in 3 weeks. At first I was skeptical about taking his herbs, but I just tried it. I was on his meds for a week when I noticed changes in my body. After the 3 weeks I called him and he said he was waiting for my call he told me to visit my doctor for another test ... honestly I never believed all that 'he was saying before the test when my doctor mentioned the statement that I am herpetic negative and the doctor started asking me how I did it, my papers for the exams I took are with me and now I am happy and happy for his herbal medicine, with these I have to say to anyone who might seek a cure, Dr MOHAMMED is a great herbalist specializing in natural herbs and roots. It contains herbal remedies for different types of serious infections / illnesses. contact him via his Email; (EMAIL; herbalcure12@gmail.com) or Whatsapp him at (+2349036036397) ........Posted by: Lillian Steve.[-------------]", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Lillian Steve", "channel": "UCHIWVeNMp58dWxJDbGO70Bw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQLuvhVt7r975Tz0cu2_pIcoXspAX7JY8apUw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwMQhqvsCdN_2EYSHN4AaABAg", "text": "11. Why We Should Manufacture Less Nutrient Foods Like Horlicks And Bournvita\r\nBournvita, Horlicks should be given to only persons who cannot exercise and are too weak. For others who have deficiency and are not too weak, they should eat natural foods and exercise so that the foods would get absorbed well in their body and their deficiency would be alright. If still they cannot exercise and get tired easily, they could do some light exercises or yoga in their spare time which would take long to get tired. If this is done, we won't have to prepare so many horlicks, bournvita and other nutrients foods like that. So then we don't have to prepare the plastic, glass or paper pack bottles and hence less pollution.\r\n12. To Reduce Television Time\r\nTelevision programs is for 24 hours a day. A human works for 8 hours a day, 1 hour for getting ready in the morning, travelling time assume for 2 hours a day, half an hour would be spent in relaxing, talking to friend's for half an hour, talking with family for half an hour, 1 hour spent in a park and sleeping time for 6 hours. Altogether 19 and half hours are spent for weekdays. So only 4 and half hours are left. In that why television is then for 24 hours. Well non working women's and students going to schools and colleges have extra free time. As television is for 24 hours now, then many students instead of spending their time in studying watch television more and study less. Non working women’s in their free time instead of watching television could do some other activities. Television should be shown in evening from 7pm to 8pm, cartoon shows should be shown for kids at that time. From 8pm to 9pm teenagers programs should be shown. From 9pm to 11pm programs should be shown for grown-up peoples. If you watch colour television for more than 2 hours, the rays coming from television affects your health and eyes.\r\nAt present due to problems going on in the world, 24 hours news channels are required. So we can keep news channels for 24 hours. Sports channels can also be shown for 24 hours. \r\nOn Sundays television can be shown for 9 to 11am in the morning and 2 to 5pm in the afternoon and 7 to 11pm in the evening.\r\nAlso in a year so many movies are made. In a year there are 52 weeks, so only 52 movies should be produced in one country. One Sunday one movie should be watched. Their should be no production of video or CD cassettes of the picture, only uploaded in the internet, so that if anyone wants to watch any movie again, they can download and watch it again. \r\nAlso if their are only 52 movies in a week, there would be less downloading of movies in the whole world and less time spent in the mobile or computer.\r\n13. Instead Of Television We Should have Projectors\r\nTo manufacture a television so many things are required, but if we have projectors instead, then we do not need that many things for television production.\r\n14. Other Things Which We Can Stop Using\r\nHeavy exercise equipment's, hair straighteners and shampoos. Only anti dandruff and hair lice shampoos are needed. Whatever vitamins and nutrients we get from shampoo for the hair, that should be found in eatable things and people should do exercises so that it gets absorbed well in the body. With regular exercise your hair would become healthy. Robots are not needed in large numbers. A few robots are needed to do some work's in companies. For jewels like gold, diamond, etc., which are manufactured in ring, necklace and other forms, just manufacture a ring as it is needed for wedding and stop other forms of manufacturing. Like this less mining would be needed of jewels and less forests would be cut down for mining.\r\nWe use steel utensils, instead of that if we use mud utensils, less mining would be needed of iron ore.\r\nGroundnuts are extracted from its skin cover, cooked and packed in plastic bags. Instead of that the groundnuts should be sold with its skin cover. The consumers should come to the store with cloth bags and buy things. In this way we can reduce plastic use. Also for other things like groundnut same method should be used.\r\n15. A Mistake In Agriculture \r\n\r\nWhen many farms are created in one place at forest, say about 100 acres, we cut all the trees their, but that would make that area hot if all trees are cut down. So maybe we should have 10 acres farm, then 10 acres forest, then 10 acres farm, then 10 acres forest. \r\n\r\n16. Why We Should Build Mud Homes Only And How Much Should Be The World's Population \r\n\r\nWe should build homes of mud only and only ground floor. As in buildings we have to use cement, due to which heat is felt more inside the house. Mud house will be cool. We may not need air conditioning, as ac cools our house, but it creates heat outside. We need so many things to build a building and so much transportation is needed to bring all those things, while a mud house will be simple and cheap to build. Mud is everywhere. We just have to dig mud from some place and build a home. If a major natural disaster strikes and your buildings are destroyed, then to again make a new building, you have to clear the rubble and build it. But if you have a mud home and if it is destroyed, then to again build it would be simple. \r\nIn a city where there are buildings and many factories, then at one place there are too many cars and all cars and factories would emit co2 and in that place the atmosphere maybe would take a long time to clear the pollution. So if there are only 1 home at one place and also factories would be at many different places, then the pollution emitted by them would be cleared by the atmosphere soon maybe. \r\nWe should have 25 homes at a place, then near to it farms for all of them, then forest, then again 25 homes and so on. \r\nIf we do this and the whole lands of our planet earth would be occupied one day with homes, farms, forests, schools, hospitals, etc., then we would come to know how much our planet earth can have maximum population. \r\nOnce the population is determined, then we have to maintain that population. For example if our earth can have a population of 10 billion peoples, then when the population reaches 10 billion, then everyone should have only one child till the population reaches 9 billion peoples. As if we have only one child then the population decreases. When population is 9 billion peoples, then everyone should have 2 children's till the population reaches 10 billion peoples. After that again we should have only one child. In this way population can be maintained. \r\nEveryone who has farms should grow things of daily use, like curry leaves, ginger, green chillies, coriander, just for themselves, if they are producing other crops like rice, wheat, etc.\r\n\r\n17. How To Reduce Transportation In The World\r\n\r\nIf one country invents a thing and then exports it to other countries in the world, much transportation is needed. Instead of that the invented thing should be taught to every countries in the world. If done like this transportation would be less needed. Only raw materials should be imported and exported\r\nfrom one country to another, if they don’t have that raw materials in their country. Countries should not import and export eatable things if it can be produced in their own countries. If one country has excess agricultural food grains, fruits, then only that country should export that things to other countries. If this is done, so much pollution can be reduced because of less transportation.\r\nIf one country has invented a thing and they would think that if they taught other countries the method to invent that thing, then they would lose profits, but that will not be the case as other countries when they will invent a thing, they will also teach the method to invent that thing to all other countries in the world.\r\nWhen a country invents a thing, any other countries companies could learn that invention from them and they should pay an amount for that, afterwards that companies can produce that thing in their own country.\r\nWhen a country has invented a thing and then other countries in the world start researching on that thing, so much money is being spent for that when already the method is known to one country. That money could be used for some other purposes.\r\nOnly weapons manufacturing and weather control methods should not be taught to any other country.\r\nIf pollution problem was not present then no problem, one country after inventing a thing could transport it to all other countries in the world, but now as pollution problem is present, then this should not be done.\r\nWhat I have written if followed the cost of living would go down. Many would become jobless and lose their businesses and will have to do farming or some other work. Life would be difficult till the world settles down with farming. Transportations will be reduced and therefore less co2 emissions. \r\n\r\nNow the way we do manufacture things, the things are costly. The poor people are becoming more poorer and some are starving, some cannot pay rent and some cannot pay for their educations. \r\n\r\nEven if everybody is educated, many would have to do labour work and their wages would be low and they will become poor in the future.\r\n\r\nSo if the cost of living is less, then even if we have low wages, at least everybody in the world could afford a home, have food to eat and pay for their educations.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "UgyExY1LgTJpoRD4e7d4AaABAg", "text": "How To Reduce Pollution\r\n\r\n1. Many Production Companies Which Are Not A Necessity For Human Beings Has To Be Stopped\r\nWe manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.\r\nWe produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. \r\nCold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. If we stopped producing this things which are not required as a necessity for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.\r\nIf we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in white natural colour. \r\n2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form\r\nWe can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. \r\nBut if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.\r\nSo if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, noodles, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. \r\nAlso we could save our money like this. If you buy a packet of bread, it would cost you more money than if you cook wheat and rice in home. \r\nIf this is done, then many jobs would be lost. For that many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own.\r\nMany people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming.\r\nIs their any another solution, that humans won't lose jobs and also pollution would decrease. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans in future.\r\n3. We Should Stop Using Makeup Products\r\nMany women's all over the world do makeup. Makeup is not a necessity for humans. Instead of doing makeup to look beautiful, women's should do exercise daily. If they exercise and sweat, eat fruits daily, they would have less dead skins and be naturally beautiful. They could save so much money if they stop using makeup products. If this is done then all the makeup manufacturing companies can be shut down. In this way all the pollution resulting from the makeup manufacturing companies would also be stopped.\r\n4. Electricity Pollution\r\nWe create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.\r\nAs I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not a necessity for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. Then maybe we could provide electricity to the whole world from windmill and Solar panels which are not pollutant. If we stopped producing electricity from coal, water, etc., then the pollution resulting from them won't occur.\r\n5. Firecrackers should be banned\r\nFirecrackers should be banned because it is harmful for animals. Animals have different levels of hearing and when we burst crackers which have a loud noise the dogs run away from that place. The dogs may hear the noise more louder than humans. When we fire the rocket cracker up in the sky and it bursts and if any bird is near to the explosion then that birds internal organs are damaged and they die just because of that explosion sound. Also peoples who have asthma illness, they face problems during Diwali. So much papers and threads are used in manufacturing crackers. The persons working in the manufacturing companies also suffer.\r\nNow when their are animals rights for not harming them, then this step of banning firecrackers must be taken.\r\n6. Hair dye manufacturing should be banned\r\nPeople use hair dye to colour their hairs. The hair dye manufacturing companies after production dumps its waste in rivers or seas which pollutes the water. So all hair dye manufacturing companies should be shut down.\r\n7. We Can Stop Eating Sweets, Cakes And Stop Drinking Liquor, Wine And Beer\r\nWe consume sweets and cakes. We make it from many things such as wheat, coconut, etc. and add sugar to it. But what we want is the sweet thing to consume which we are getting directly from fruits. The fruit is naturally sweet. So if we want to consume sweets and cakes, we do not have to prepare it, just we have to eat fruits. So all the sweet manufacturing companies can be shut down. If you shut down a sweet manufacturing company, then so many paper boxes need not be manufactured which are used to pack the sweets.\r\nLiquor, wine and beer are also made from fruits. So if you want to consume liquor, wine and beer, just eat fruits. If this is followed, then you do not have to set up liquor factories and prepare cartoon boxes for liquors. Everybody should go to the rehabilitation centres those who can't live without liquor or prepare liquor in their own homes. Those who smoke cigarettes, they should grow tobacco in their own homes and buy a tobacco pipe and smoke cigarettes, then we can shut down the tobacco industry also.\r\n8. To Stop Using Perfumes And Powders Which Is Not A Necessity\r\nFor bad smell in body both men and women should exercise and sweat, it would reduce the bad smell.\r\nIf you stop using perfumes and powders, we don't need perfume and powder manufacturing companies and perfume and powder bottles need not be manufactured, cartoon boxes need not be manufactured for packing them and transportations can be reduced.\r\n9. Could We Stop Drinking Cow's and Buffalo's Milk\r\nWhatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow's and buffalo's milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. \r\nFor infants whose mother's have died or mother's who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow's and buffalo's milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use lime with tea and coffee or just plain tea and coffee. A lime should be cut into a few pieces and cooked with tea and coffee or something else can be used instead of lime.\r\n10. A Manufacturing Company Which Is Not A Necessity For Human Beings, If It Is Stopped, Then We Have The Following Benefits\r\nWhen a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings, if it is stopped, then we have the following benefits.\r\nThat company which is built in a place, that much land is saved, machines does not have to be manufactured, for machines to operate oil is needed and many other things, for which we have to make oil manufacturing company and all other companies for all other things like cartoon boxes, plastic ropes and plastic cans, registers, pencil, pen, stationery products. To make cartoon boxes papers are required and to stick papers gums are required. To make gums so much dough is needed and caustic soda is needed. If we don't manufacture cartoon boxes then that dough can be eaten. Transportation is needed to deliver things to all the shops. For transportation we need vehicles and to operate vehicles petrol is needed, to get petrol we have to set up oil rig platforms in the sea or land and to deliver petrol to a petrol pump that petrol is needed to be put in a drum, a plastic drum has to be manufactured and then many ships have to be manufactured for shipping the petrol to all the places. For all this works so much land is lost and so much pollution is created, from that pollution humans, land animals, sea animals, aerial animals and earth is suffering. Also many transportation items which requires huge trucks for transportation a driver has to drive only at night and his day life is lost. Surely at night time driving the driver would become sleepy sometimes and accidents do happen. \r\nAll of this can be reduced and this will be our benefits if we stopped a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings. When you stop making a manufacturing company then all the problems related with it won't occur.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "shiva koliar", "channel": "UCo7AJs3bzP4rapONqTDYzbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4X-K6Cmvf4liYl2PpWCKqv6XOKXq8s5f9EQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Interestingly, Laurence did not only work for the #WWF but was also the president of an agro association and the director of a genetic engineering company at that time. “I am independent and that is why I was able to establish cooperation between an environmental organisation and the industry,” explains Laurence. The soy business is huge in #Argentina. The size of the soy desert is as big as Germany. Argentina and the company Monsanto plan to double the size of the plantation – with the support of WWF. The Fund claims that the forests are substandard and useless. Although jaguars, monkeys and many other species habitat that forest. People living in the soy desert are facing water shortage and illnesses due to the herbicide #Roundup. Genetically modified seeds from #Monsanto have to be sprayed with this herbicide. Roundup is a successor to #AgentOrange. It is dangerous for humans; it can change genes, cause cancer and abnormalities. The house of family Rojas was once sprayed by accident. All of their food crops died, Mr Rojas got skin rash and his pregnant wife gave birth to a dead baby with strong abnormalities. Several doctors found that the abnormalities were due to changes in the baby’s genes, most likely caused by Roundup. Despite the dangerous herbicide and unproven risks of genetically modified food, Monsanto has been certified by the Round Table for Responsible Soy (#RTRS) in 2010. The WWF is officially against genetic engineering but is a member of RTRS.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Picham", "channel": "UCDGYZT6YtiUr7ZQKgFP_XeQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRa02JzgsxrIohFslfM3i_TyTsRS-l4Sg78Hx-Dvg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Ang polusyon ay ang isa sa pinaka malaking problema sa ating bansa at dahil ito sa mga basurang pakalat kalat lang. Dapat nating ugaliing mag tapon ng basura sa tamang paraan upang maiwasan natin ang pagkakasakit ng mga tao at ang pagbabaha sa tuwing umuulan. Kapag may nakita kang plastik ng kendi sa kalye, pwede mo itong kunin at itapon o di kaya'y pag may basura ka at walang basurahan, ilagay mo muna ito sa iyong bulsa at itapon pag may nahanap kana. Maging disiplinado tayo sa ating sarili dahil para rin naman ito sa kalagayan nating lahat.\n\n2. Magtanim ng halaman at puno. Ang mga halaman at puno ay isa rin sa nakakapagligtas sa atin sa kapahamakan, ito ay nagbibigay sa atin ng preskong hangin at oxygen. Malaking tulong rin ito pag may kalamidad sapagkat napipigilan ng puno ang mga malalaking baha. Kaya pag may libreng oras ka, pwedeng pwede kang magtanim ng mga kahit anong halaman o puno at alagaan itong mabuti.\n\n3. Mag-recycle tayo ng mga basura. Wag nating sayangin ang mga basura na pwede pang gamitin kagaya nalang ng mga newspapers at magazines, malamang sa malamang na pagkatapos etong basahin ng isang tao ay itatapon na niya eto pero magagamit pa natin siya sa mas magandang paraan. Pwede natin itong gamitin sa ating mga proyekto, sa paggawa ng mga flowers vase at iba pang mga gamit. Ugaliin natin ang hindi pag sayang ng mga gamit na pwede pa kasi nakakatulong rin ito sa ating kalikasan.\n\n4. Magtipid sa paggamit ng kuryente at tubig. Isa rin ito sa pinakaimportanteng bagay na dapat alahanin natin sapagkat ang pagtitipid ng tubig at kuryente ay malaking tulong sa ating kalikasan dahil nakakapaghinga sila rito.\n\n5. Iwasan ang paggamit ng plastik.

The 2-degree increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat. That extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and\nchanging habitat ranges for plants and animals—expanding some and shrinking others.\nConditions in 2020\n\nAccording to the 2020 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2020 except December was in the top four warmest on record for that month. In December, the presence of a moderately strong La Niña event cooled the tropical Pacific Ocean and dampened the global average warmth. The month turned out as \"only\" the eighth warmest December on record.\nDespite La Niña, 2020 ranked as the second-warmest year in the 141-year record for the combined land and ocean surface, and land areas were hottest on record. Many parts of Europe and Asia were record warm, including most of France and northern Portugal and Spain, most of the Scandinavian Peninsula, Russia, and southeastern China. An even larger portion of the globe was much warmer than average, including most of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The heat reached all the way to the Antarctic, where the station at Esperanza Base, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, appeared to set a new all-time record high temperature of 65.1 degrees Fahrenheit (18.4 degrees Celsius) on February 6, 2020. \n\nFor more regional details and 2020 climate statistics, see the 2020 Annual Climate Report from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. \n\nChange over time\n\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's 2020 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 (0.18°C / 0.32°F) has been more than twice that rate.\nIn 2020 models project that global surface temperature is more than 0.5°C (0.9°F) warmer than the 1986-2005 average, regardless of which carbon dioxide emissions pathway the world follows. This similarity in temperatures regardless of total emissions is a short-term phenomenon: it reflects the tremendous inertia of Earth's vast oceans. The high heat capacity of water means that ocean temperature doesn't react instantly to the increased heat being trapped by greenhouse gases. By 2030, however, the heating imbalance caused by greenhouse gases begins to overcome the oceans' thermal inertia, and projected temperature pathways begin to diverge, with unchecked carbon dioxide emissions likely leading to several additional degrees of warming by the end of the century.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "princess A", "channel": "UCQhOyAnDFL-wuG6BfAesNiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/xPJRua5n0aDdx5soxbJIRA-qfQd6a3a8LvQUr1C3wQJNIOT_mbVFzJN80oFAH4AO00zax4ju=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Doesn't matter how much you want to wish-think a god into existence, it will still just be your mind playing tricks on you.\n\nTough shit about keeping my opinions to myself too :) Reality shows me that humanity needs to be greatly humbled from its delusional ways. Sooner the better too I might add. Discussion puts people in their places. Discussion allows reason and logic to demonstrate the absurd claims of the delusional. Moreover, why do you get a say over me? Its because of your religion that you think you do! Its ok for you to post your bullshit here, but not ok for me to call you out on it? Doesn't that make you a hypocrite? I would say of course it does.\n\nAnd lastly, you are greatly mistaken if you think that religions do not hinder the world from evolving. Just look at Darwin and his discovery of Evolution... 150yrs later and there are still silly religious imbeciles arguing against this. It took decades for Science to get it into the classrooms, why exactly? And why is it so stark to show that ONLY the religious have a problem with it? Well because you are truly the brainwashed among us, and it produces evidence in contrary to your world view. I however follow reality, and bend my views in light of evidence, and not the other way around. Unfortunately delusional beliefs run high in our species.

Let's just look at Michigan as a quick example.\nMichigans water levels are rising, this is bad because:\n\n1) Houses, apartments, roads, stores, entire towns in some cases, are very near to the coast. Water levels rising essentially guarantees they'll be wiped off the map. \n2) Once those water levels rise our chances of having tropical storms occur on the great lakes will rise as well. Lake Eerie has only had one tropical storm in US history until this year.\n3) Fish and aquatic wildlife are already having environmental problems because of the asian goby thats invading the lakes and the Zebra Mussel, but this will only get worse once they have even more tidepools to breed in\n4) Lake Michigan is home to quite a few lakeside factories, and as happy as I will be to see them shut down, the owners will not pay to have them TORN down, meaning they will flood, and all their debris will wash out into the lakes as well. \nThis is ESPECIALLY bad with cement factories because they produce a lot of limestone dust, and that can turn water acidic, and poisonous. \n5) Even if they cleaned out or transported literally every crate of limestone dust they have, the factories use explosives to mine it locally. Meaning that the quarries will flood too, so the limestone dust is inevitable even if they DID care.\n6) Climate,  Michigan to most people is: SNOW.\nBut we actually have a fairly delicate ecosystem. See normally we have our first snowfall slightly before Halloween, but the first snowfall THIS year was yesterday and I live in the NORTH.\nThis becomes an issue because while it might not snow, it still rains a lot. Causing icy roads, unsafe conditions, freezing water pipes because they're overflowing, ect, and this only gets worse when the water levels are higher, because our sewer systems start flooding too.\n7) All that non-snow? Doesnt do very well for animals with a winter coat. Because now all those white rabbits are basically glowing to predators, harming their population since wild rabbits arent very populous prey in Michigan.\n8) Doesnt help the other animals much either, freezing rain isn't fun for anybody to deal with but least of all for the animals that don't have a house to get warm in. And there aren't a lot of caves in michigan so wish those deer luck with finding shelter.\n9) Salmon (yes I know im back to fish again) Have a very strange way of reproducing, they always return to where they're born. Now while their nests might not ALL be wiped out from water levels rising, they will be MUCH more easily accessed by predators. Harming their population some more, while also helping the Goby's steal their territory.\n10) If our towns are destroyed, we will probably move elsewhere, but that increases ubanization which means we will further destroy more habitats and ecosystems to find more places to build new towns and houses.\n\nIt's dominoes Dude, one thing affects a ton of shit and Im literally only covering the effects that would come from a rise in water levels.  So while I read your comment about the whole \n\"Destroying the planet\" thing. It seems your view on \"destroy\" is literally seeing the earth split in half like in a cartoon. \nTrust me when I say, it'd be a lot scarier to watch all the animals and plants start dying because they cant survive in an ecosystem that changed too fast for them to adapt to.", "time": "9 months ago (edited)", "author": "Jasmine Gallagher", "channel": "UCoP5aFokt3muv6Ezg9SC6IQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT-e-YYfOzQsqYTi-HfSxIHl3I69Z7GGF4gXt0MKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However, that wasn't Communism (then I give definition as evidence).\nminion: Yes, I agree.\nminion: Communism has killed more people and devastated so many societies!\n\nDisingenuous to say the least, all to maintain a capitalism-at-all-costs mentality. Highly disingenuous when we take into account the future of our planet, and the gravity of what is at stake. AND not to mention, many minions even have children too! Do you have children by chance? Because your beliefs matter to their survival as well, you know?\n\nLook, Marx created Communism, and by Marx's stance, Socialism AND Communism fundamentally mean …\n\n1) NO government\n2) NO monetary system\n3) Method of production owned by the people.\n\nI don’t care what country you are talking about past or present, as far as I know, this has never been implemented at a national level yet. And looking at it more deeply, shouldn’t it be indicated, if whatever country we are looking at, that has a monetary system, it should therefore be better classified as some type of quasi form of capitalism? I mean, capitalism has a government to control it, and capitalism of course has a monetary system, and the method of production, in most presented cases (like your perception of North Korea), the method of production is held by a small group of people at the top, not unlike what we see under capitalism too! LMFAO :) Even in North Korea, the method of production was never owned by the people either! How the hell can anyone say, that's Communism, when it misses all 3 fundamental points?!\n\nIm a man of Science, and words have meaning; definitions are critical. In reply to your ever-so-glaring error, the North Koreans self-profess that they are a Republic Democracy as seen by their name \"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea\" (no shitting you, go look it up), however because we have a definition too, for a Republic Democracy, we know that North Korea is far from anything having to do with a Republic or a Democracy, right? So why are disingenuous minions like yourself again, unable to see, the same goes for those self-professed Socialist and Communist countries as well?! They were not Communist at all! In fact, they were much much closer to the definitions of state capitalism, and/or dictatorships to be intellectually honest.\n\nTo debunk your point regarding \"it will always turns to corruption\", I say that's capitalism you are talking about again. How do I know? Tell me how I can corrupt people without a monetary system to do so? Its clearly much much more difficult to do.\n\nAs a man of Science, Ill always follow definitions, in order to prove hypotheses, in order to continually evolve in light of presented evidence (I strongly invite the whole world to start doing the same). To prove my point, using Communism in it’s proper context, tell me a country, past or present, where all 3 of the above listed objectives were met previously, and Ill stop advocating for Communism.\n\nNever happened as far as I can tell.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Carlos Spicyweiner", "channel": "UC7_mmqkN0nZbaCRm77CHx9Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRr-9C9QOPNeyQDVJ4wjV94A4VFrfB-jRI4Yw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Sadly, there are agribusinesses specifically for cattle and soybean production (to feed the cattle) who are responsible for these fires in the Amazon, up to 80% of the cause of the entirety of deforestation in the Amazon alone. \nThis is a significant number that even contributes to climate change and promotes habitat loss. In no way does it help out the Amazon because the land is not re-used. Farmers only put their cattle on the land and farm their soybeans right after the fires for the benefit of their business. This major deforestation has been in practice by these agribusinesses for years, ever since the 1960s. That is why you were being told that this is regular and is a yearly occasion. \nPlease respond if you have any more questions, but be sure to even look this up online.

Face it, we are killing the planet day by day. We are ruining it as we live our daily lives. Future generations may not be able to live in this unsafe environment. I know, people are doing as much as they can to stop it, yet, even now, several people are even doing little things that kill our planet. The wild is suffering due to our selfish acts. Our governments need to act NOW before our population stops growing and we NEED to regain our balance. We need a net zero balance and keep out unhealthy emissions. If you think about it, we are saving everyone, cleaning the air, saving wildlife, cleaning our ocean, working together in peace. Make changes and transfer to sustainable energy. And like David Attenborough said, if we embrace the challenge we face and if we change the world, we will definitely be able to call it, “Our Planet.” Do little things to help, even children! Save energy, don't waste water, walk to school or work (or even ride a bike) fundraise: just anything to help our planet.

I have been Vegan for 4 and a half years from when I was 14 years old until now and it was genuinely the greatest choice I have ever made in my life. This was after watching Forks over Knives, Vegucated and Food Inc.\nHowever being vegan was less socially respected 4 years ago. It was hard as a boy playing football and going to high school to tell people I was vegan because it was so out of the norm. I’m not a doctor however I know that transforming into eating plant based took a weeks before the strong desire for animal proteins wore off, which is just one of a couple difficult steps that payed massive benefits in every aspect of my life. \nEveryday being vegan has became easier for me and my health and energy usually can be spectacular if I am taking care of myself aside from just eating healthy plant based foods. I absolutely love food I eat and I don’t feel guilty about eating as much as I want. I haven’t craved meat and animal products for years and I’m impressed with the ease I have when Deciding where to eat even while I’m backpacking through Colombia at the moment.\nWhile grocery stores had vegan alternatives 4 years ago , they were not nearly as plentiful and delicious as today. Nowadays the survival of restaurants and grocery stores relies upon their ability to provide food for those seeking to make their own sustainable plant based food choices and reduce waste. I chose to write this comment because I know if you made it to the end of reading this you are someone who has the courage to do the right thing regardless of convenience and complete social acceptance, and I know that taking the first step towards a new stronger lifestyle that you will realize how much power you have inside of you to set a standard for how to save our planet and ourselves.\nThank you to Netflix and OurPlanet for being a significant influence on helping educate people around the world on the truth and what we can do to save our planet!", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "MacLiveSimply", "channel": "UCJq0128m3CmihOFnTMB21TA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlDkWT3fJaMYOgzN6UFrAnuwwLLfWjOLIevlaO=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Hansen is the climatologist that diagnosed our climate problem — but he says believing in 100% renewables is like believing in the Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy. Renewables are intermittent and too unreliable to do the job.  https://tinyurl.com/yclaf2sn   \nPeople think solar is clean, but because solar is so diffuse (spread out), it actually requires a huge amount of land and resources to supply some energy, some of the time. Solar produces 300 TIMES THE WASTE of nuclear power.  https://tinyurl.com/y7cm2te9    So instead, Hansen says the world should build 115 reactors a year! https://tinyurl.com/zp3552t\nNew Generation 3 reactors have passive safety and would have survived both Chernobyl and Fukushima. I would much rather live next to an CA_1400 than next to a coal fired plant - the dust from a coal burner is more radioactive than living next to a nuclear power plant! This is why George Monbiot says: “….when coal goes right it kills more people than nuclear power does when it goes wrong. It kills more people every week than nuclear power has in its entire history. And that’s before we take climate change into account.” https://tinyurl.com/93nm9sn\nBut in a decade or so we will have commercialised breeder reactors that eat nuclear waste! There are a variety of breeder reactors. ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor They convert nuclear waste into enough fuel to run the UK for 500 years and America for 1000! Breeder reactors get 90 times the energy out of each bit of uranium, so uranium from seawater will run us for billions of years. (Erosion tops up the oceans with uranium particles.) A particular kind of breeder called the Molten Salt Reactor cannot melt down ever because it is already a liquid. If anything, the hot liquid salt wants to freeze into a solid at anything below 400C. If the power to this reactor fails, the fuel drains out of the reactor into drain tanks and dries solid. It isn't going anywhere. Finally, once the breeder reactor has burned the waste again and again, Argonne labs shows how to melt it down into ceramic tablets and store it under the reactor-park for just 500 years. Then it is safe! Here’s the 4 minute Argonne Labs video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlMDDhQ9-pE\nBasically, according to THE FOUNDER of modern climate science, it's nuclear power or climate change.

{"cid": "UgxnRwSv_CuD4HTknZ54AaABAg", "text": "things you can do:\nUpgrade your house - Make it more energy efficient. get solar pannels on your roof. have more plants inside and out. Get a green roof. Get a water filter/purifier so you can always drink tapwater no matter where you live. If you have a garden, ditch the grass and plant multiple plants from flowers to berries to help bees, birds and other insects.\n\n\nStop using single use plastics - Take your own bag to any store. Dont use plactic plates or cutlery. Get straws that last longer, Don't buy coffee or other drinks in plastic cups everyday. Store and take food with you in reusable containers. Stop buying so many ready made meals, make your own, it's cheaper and better. \n\n\nWatch what you buy - Certain brands of products from chocolate to clothing don't pay their workers or farmers enough or even employ children. Many brands use stuff in their products from and unsustainable source (think palm oil). Some makeup brands test on animals. Some chemicals or microplasctics in products like sunscreen, shampoo and toothpaste directly affect the ocean the moment it flows down the drain. Don't buy products that are wrapped in plastic for no reason.\n\n\nWatch what you eat - Produce is sprayed with harmfull chemicals more ofte than not so watch out for that. Always buy local and in season produce. If you want good meat go to a butcher you know buys animals that had a decent life or go for the organic brands. For eggs, get free range. If you’re ready to go a step further you can go vegetarian or vegan. This is a very good choice because a huge amount of deforestation and pollution is caused by the bio-industry.\n\n\nEducate others - Even though some idiots out there dont believe in climate change, hopefully they're open to listenening about the growing human population and how we need to be more sustainable to feed all of us. Or how we are destroying the habitats of our wildlife.\n\n\nKeep pushing - Getiing the government and big coorperations to do something about this issue is not a left or right thing. Go out, protest. Every single one of us is and will be affected, especially younger generations. If you somehow are a person that has some kind of influence (You sell a product for example) do something. Push big brands like apple to start making products that last longer and are made from more sustainable materials.\n\n\nRecicle - Old electronics, fabric, plastic, bottle, cans, wood, you name it. You can either resell it or get it to a place where it'll be used again.\nSepparate your trash. Plastic, paper, glass, organic waste.\n\nmentality - Stop with the dumbass ''Why should I care, I'm not affected'' or ''We're all gonna die anyway'' bullshit.\nJust cause you dont feel like what you're doing has a negative impact, somewhere it will. \nAnd just cause you don't feel like you're making a positive impact, doesn't mean you aren't. A lifetime is a long time.\n\n\nLittle changes in consumption-behaviour can make a big difference the longer you do it and the more people do it.\n\n\n\n(feel free to add more to the list)", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Lucas A", "channel": "UCaitDdG_H1ybaNn0L8VgiaQ", "votes": "1.2K", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRwC1rO6a0UgchkpdjalrvRvDg6BYwTSCRmXtIh=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It frustrates me when environmentalists do not prioritise this obvious solution that would enable us to rewild our own land and create a more compassionate environment for all animals.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "orla coghlan", "channel": "UCIiqPlrtSY6SsVHo-rBWYkA", "votes": "42", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSnoodI-1Wqd6WdF5NJrmIhNs7v334LzmQ4SQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Every day we're pumping 2.4 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the air... More than 4 million pounds of garbage is being thrown into the ocean every day. We are cutting 3.5b-7.5b each year... But we are only planting 1.6b. The current world population is 7.8 billion, but... By 2050 it could be up to 11.2 billion people... And the Earth will not have enough resources to feed everyone. Since 1880 the global temperature has increased by 0.8 degrees Celsius, and the climate is changing rapidly now. In just 2 minutes, 100 thousand trees will be cut down... and more than 5,000 pounds of trash will be thrown into the sea. .. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \"\"ONE\"\" OUT OF EVERY \"\"EIGHT\"\" ANIMAL SPECIES IS AT RISK OF EXTINCTION!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an animal lover, I am feeling so bad to hear that. Its a UN report can be seen here.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climat...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNever heard of that ever. This is what likely going to happen in our lifetime. Never thought of something this kind. It's definitely a disaster. We are heading towards a dead-end. We are walking on the path of destruction... If we don't wake up, we all are doomed. It's definitely not too late either. Nothing but collective efforts from a human is what every living animal is hoping for. Every human has to do something that helps to slow down this freak rate. And it's not just the animals, it's us who are going to suffer for sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you eat wild animals for fun, if you destroy wild habitat for human settlements, if you mass catch fishes from the ocean using giant machines, if you test massive nuclear bombs underground and underwater.... then ready to pay this epic price! We have already emptied Earth's underground reserves by extracting oil, gas, and minerals which resulted in the total destruction of the natural habitat of all living things including micro-organisms, plants, animals and marine life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, do you want Humans to go extinct?\r\nYour answer is probably \"No\".\r\n\r\n\r\nMine is yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we began 1.5 million years ago, the Earth around us was full of life, since modern humans became a thing about 200,000 years ago, we were starting to destroy a bit of earth.\r\nNothing \"major\".\r\n\r\n\r\n10,000 years ago, humans weren't going so great, not even as good as 200,000 years ago.\r\nWe knew at that time we could make it a better place for them, however not so much for animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut...\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were waiting for something.\r\nWhat were we waiting for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simple answer, *WARMTH*, at the time we were in an ice age, but once that was over, we started making modern farms and gardens, learning how to kill animals for meat more efficiently, these effects were not a major impact on the environment at the time, but it would be soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThousands of years later...\r\nLet's fast forward to the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impacts were now *very noticeable*.\r\nAnimals, dying quicker than ever, global warming starting to become more serious, human technology getting better, pollution getting more serious.\n\r\n\r\nAnd now...\r\n\r\n\r\n\rWe only have so many choices...\n\r\n1. We destroy all animal species including ourselves...\r\n2. We figure out a way for humans and other species to *thrive*.\r\n3. We figure out a way for only other species to thrive and destroy ourselves in some way. \r\n4. We live how we are supposed to.\r\n \r\n\r\nWait, so what do I mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, we've all heard it, \"no one's normal, everyone's different.\"\r\nBut I think there may be a way to be normal...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's by, living how we were supposed to.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunting animals for meat, like lions or other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we wouldn't do this so it had a major impact on the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then we would not create any items that may be used in modern technology, we don't make any buildings, this results in no pollution, environmental degradation, global warming, ozone depletion,  and ocean acidification. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis would make the Earth a way better place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when I said yes to human's going extinct, I either wanted to live how we are supposed to or go extinct fully and let Earth thrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPicking up 1 piece of plastic off the street a day...\nTelling your friend not to shoot a bird every day...\nEducating people on these major effects...\n\n\n\n\nWill make a difference.\n\n\nA tiny one, but 1 more person educated about this...\nMeans they educate another person...\nThis cycle will keep going...\nAnd that's what's been happening...\nHowever, we need to do it faster.\n\nSo spread this message, please.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Smokey", "channel": "UCFxKeb07Wdr-Br8aJyAKb1w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/-9nbweQRAa-P-5NYYjaFtxm0jFaOnNBshSTEyqPDZ_v9O3OZEzYYHw4N8TERiQXCGcduLUucTQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyZyBbXp7vD9wRBM9t4AaABAg.8v3wD7rF4Xo8zbx6rs3XtS", "text": "​ @Zero Echoes  Its so strange how we can imagine the entire world's demise, before we can imagine the end of capitalism! Ridiculous :) \n\nRemember this ... start with a false premise, end with a false conclusion.\n\nNot unlike any addiction, we have to admit our habit first, agreed? We need to know and understand the 2 biggest problems plaguing humanity above all else.  This video is a excellent summary in regards to humanities #1 greatest problem ->\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p76YZUOlcIc&t=1s\n\nIts a lot easier than you think though. However, the problem is nobody WANTS TO change their belief system, and here lies our #2 greatest problem to overcome. And to use the addiction analogy again, many are just not seeing their own addiction to money itself. MONEY IS POISON TO NATURE, as witnessed in the video. Mother nature is telling us \"my way or the highway\", and as Evolution predicts, evolve or perish. Take your pick. Lucky for us, it turns out we are one of the most adaptive species on the planet~! (Except when it comes to republicunts and their dogmatism lol). I strongly believe with education, we can kick the habit too, before its too late. Proof?\n\ncapitalist corporations argued that tobacco is not responsible for cancer. Public was educated with Science, then we see a major decrease in smoking across Western countries.\n\ncapitalist corporations argued that lead in gasoline was fine for usage. Public was educated with Science, then we see the abolishment of lead in gasoline and paints across Western countries.\n\nIt stands to reason then, as capitalist corporations are merely arguing once again, that this time money is not destroying our natural habitat, if the Public could be educated with Science, then we would be able see the abolishment of capitalism across Western countries :) :)\n\nWe need to address the public everywhere, with the horrors of capitalism first and foremost. And as witnessed here and in many other threads about climate change, we are not having the discussion at all. Time to evolve my friend! Wake up the people to WHY we have no power. I often use the Princeton U. study for reference ->\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig&t=3s\n\nAlso, this video works well if any people like to say, \"but capitalism has lifted more countries out of blah blah blah\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEKUVff7fLk&t=630s\n\nOn a side ... if you haven't noticed already, Im a man of Science and evidence, and to me the above mentioned Princeton U. study, along with Thomas Piketty's (capitalism in the 21st Century), indicating the horrors of what 300 years of capitalism has done to humanity, are the 2 most compelling cases why we are in trouble. They both of course, point directly at capitalism. Any way you dice it however, make no mistake about it, it will be SCIENCE that gets us out of any worldly catastrophe, if anything is going to get us out at all.\n\nWhen looking to nature, we see that the collective is much more highly beneficial to animals. Its much more difficult for a lone wolf to be able to catch his meal alone, right? We need to form a system that benefits the majority of us, WHILE being completely congruent with nature. Taking into account everything I have indicated up until this point, I advocate for a RBE.\n\nIn short, to answer your question, THIS is how we get there ->\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDhSgCsD_x8&t=255s\n\nIm literally crazy looking this stuff up all the time, for even decades now LOL I have asked the same question as you, over and over again, and this is really the ONLY conclusion I was able to come to.\n\nTo recap and create a road map for us to use ->\n\n1) Smack the shit outta those people that adhere to the anti-Science belief of capitalism. Literally fight them tooth and nail everywhere you meet them, until they understand the underlying problem, capitalism is NEVER going to be congruent with nature.\n2) Stop with the capitalism/Socialism argument, and have people move beyond this, to focus on a RBE, the better alternative to both. Use the video link for quick reference like I have. Encourage them to think outside the box.\n3) The game is played upward from there. Collectively, when we take back our democracy by dismantling capitalism (no money = no rich elite interference), we pool all the earthly resources and implement Systems Theory as seen in the video, and THEN AND ONLY THEN will we be strong enough to reverse climate change and avert total destruction of our entire world. Sooner the better too I might add.\n\nAnd lastly, to say it again, I have researched this to a great extent. I have found nothing better. It seems to me that we are in a situation similar to having only 1 arrow, and having to let go of the bow string at exactly the precise moment as to pass through a keyhole, to hit an apple on the other side of a door, all while riding a horse.

I’m not sure if you said this but I want to also point out an idea. In Finland the school education system made it to where there is close to no private schools there. That makes it so that the rich kids have to go to public schools and so the parents would have to give the school money and help it improve so that they’re sure that the school their kids are in are good. That way, all of those kids can benefit from them. I think if we implement that towards modern society in some way, it would probably help society a lot more", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Zero Echoes", "channel": "UCSyePYmpTgc0SBuLS0Q6fHw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTATs1H5UaFpEEjhiydPzRwwBzqA4BEeCzWWxheLg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes, in short you are right, moving away from privatization, and schools to teach uneducated people (or those with an skewed education like those in America) to use the scientific method regarding anything they wish to talk about.

Not by definition though; not as per Marx. \nHowever, Im not even a Socialist/Communist. I will argue for them when pitted against capitalism in any debate (capitalism by the scientific method is proven to be the worst system ever), but if we really want to rise above this stupid argument to get out of the capitalist's control,  we should be arguing for a RBE.

No matter how hard our efforts, no matter how much we try, the world will never be the same. One hundred years from now, our world as we know it may cease to exist. And even if our planet does survive, imagine living in a world where you've never seen the beautiful coral reefs that are already becoming extinct. Imagine knowing there once was a time when there were things called grasslands and forests and gardens and flowers, or knowing that there were once all kinds of animals that you could see whenever you went outside. Imagine knowing your kids, your great grandchildren, and anyone after that that you helped indirectly create, are jealous of a life they knew once existed and that some people were lucky enough to live through it, and they don't get to see any of it. Maybe they won't even be allowed to go outside because of the scalding temperatures or the polluted air. They've never seen snow or rain or jumped in puddles or swam in a lake or a pool on a hot summer day. They've only heard of such things through stories told through generations or seen in paintings or photographs. Imagine knowing that you set them up for that life, one that nobody deserves. Nobody wants that on their conscience and just thinking about that makes me want to get up and change everything. But it's too late, and we've already messed up too badly. Maybe if we all worked together, there would be enough time. But imagine having to convince over 7.5 billion people to work together to save our planet, and even if it worked, we would have so little time. If I have to face the consequences for my actions, so be it.

Because there will be some place for some bird. I don't want to be the guy who kills your motivation (because I am designing a drone for planting trees, i'm on your side really). I just want to be someone who can focus your motivation in a right path. Look, going to numbers, a tree, and even a million of trees don't change a thing. They give place for animals, yes, but we talk about Global Warming issue. And if we see it this way, even if we cover ALL of our land with trees, we can't counterweight the amount of CO2 we released by burning fuels at least for one single year. But that's even worst. With global warming those forests will become a wildfire and this is REALLY bad. During the tree life it releases VOC's and CO2 too, it reflects light pretty poorly, so trees don't solve even the 0.01% you mention. The thing is to STOP BURNING STUFF.

I for one didn't focus on you to hate on you or attack you, mainly tried to explain why we \"judge and compare\" (btw, agreed, that's silly too, but it's unavoidable sometimes, and in this case it's for a good cause 😜). We obviously shouldn't judge anyone based on if they donated for Notre Dame because we can't know how hard and in which ways he tries to save (some) animals and the planet, but again, I believe everyone comments on that purely because the rich seem to care more about the wrong things – unless you're rich you shouldn't have taken this bit so personally.\nThat's all I guess, hope I made you see where we're coming from, even if we still disagree past a certain extent... there's nothing wrong with that!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "hawkstrike18+", "channel": "UCkJDg87FK0O42duFN5F0exQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLScOWNs-UqQVovdxbKniX23218hfNUt3D9yG6lxIw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So we take the chances to help when we can.

In Sweden every decision about the environment is made by the people. You're right that loads of people won't take responsibility. But i wouldn't want our future generations thinking the same thing about us, just because we didn't think we could make a difference.

Rather it addresses the fact that that there are an excess of domesticated animals vs non-domesticated, causing an excess in waste production that this world is not meant to equalize naturally. If humans and their domesticated animals did not exsist, and the world was never touched by humans in the first place, there would be far less creatures on this planet. The fact that 96% of animals on this planet are domesticated does not necessarily hold any evidence to the amount of \"wild areas\" left, because theoratically all humans and domestic animals could be crammed together and that statistic could still be valid.\nBy saying this i do not mean to say that the wild populations and areas are not greatly reduced by our living standards, because they are. Im just stating that the fact of 96% domestic animals does not correlate to there only being 4% of wild lands. Rather the subject is far more complex.\nWe would have to account for what the natural amount of animals would be for those wild areas. Even if we had many wild lands, our domestic animals may still make up over 50% of the animals because we mass produce livestock to feed our unnatural population of humans. \n\nI appologize if this sounds confusing at all", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "catdey", "channel": "UC2qVGS2PWx0eVx0vcnKE2NA", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQt_LQxSmfYd4sWOWFiyrctD9gGVg9mD5R3Cg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you see someone who has thrown a piece of rubbish on the floor don’t just stand there...go pick it up for God’s sake! If you see a rubbish bin look around for a piece of rubbish to put in it. Try using less plastic. Try at least going a day without meat. Try and save our world! One of my dreams is to go and explore the world before everything dies, before all our animals go extinct. But we can change those thoughts. Think about all the future generations wishing that they could see a lion, or see a rhino, or any animals really. Most of us wish we could see dinosaurs but we can’t, this is how our children or our children’s children will feel like. And I don’t want them to.

We are meddling with nature because how did things get so bad to begin with? We're the only ones complaining about climate issues and global warming-do you think any other species does this? Yes we have the power to limit and halt the progression of planet-altering calamities, but in the end nature wins and we'll all fall under its feet. Believe me when I was 12/13 I was obsessively worried about these planet problems-fast forward 14 years and nothing has happened to me, so why would I care? I know that's selfish but we are much better off looking after our own than trying to take care of the planet when we can't take care of ourselves.

{"cid": "UgxxP5b1AozxLrTaXrR4AaABAg", "text": "David's Words: \n\"How do we create a future in which both people and nature can thrive? This is the biggest question of our time. In the next few decades we need to do something unprecedented, achieve a sustainable existence on Earth, but how do we do it? We can started by understanding how we got to this point. 20,000 years ago humankind consisted of less than a million hunter gatherers across the globe. We lived within the resources on offer, in balance with nature. A strategy that theoretically could last forever. But is wasn’t an easy life. Nature determined our survival. We used our unique minds to challenged that reality. We learned how to tame the wild and get more from the environment. Our population boomed as did our demands. Every time a new problem arose, we solved it, altering Earth’s entire surface in the process.  Now we have changed the world so profoundly scientists have decided that Earth has entered a new phase of its existence, welcome to the Anthropocene: the age of humans.  The tables have turned, we now determine natures survival. The planet is ours, there is just one problem, we are now totally out of balance with nature and unless we get our balance back this age of humans is due to be short lived. So how we do deal with this problem? When you boil it down there is one big underlying big issue, our planet is becoming less wild. Our species has cleared 2 trillion trees, cultivated half its fertile land and now fishes across most of the oceans. In the last 50 years the populations of wild animals have reduced by 60%. We have replaced them with ourselves and our domesticated animals and plants. Today, we and the animals we raise account for 96% of the mass of mammals and 70% of the amount of birds on this Earth. There is very little wild left. This biodiversity loss is not just a tragedy, it is the single biggest problem that we face. Without biodiversity, the world as we know it, doesn’t work. Our planet needs its wild spaces. Everyone is a part or component of the global machine. Only if they are all healthy can the planet run smoothly. A less wild world is less able to provide for our needs, less able to maintain dependable weather and seasons, less able to absorb our impact. Biodiversity equals stability and stability is what we need most of all. Can we turn this situation around? Can we re-wild the world? \nWell maybe, due to one key change. As societies develop something is happening that has never happened before. People are having fewer children. Globally since the year 2000, the number of people 16 and under has hardly change. The main reason why our population is still rising is because people are living longer. If this continues, our population might stop growing by the turn of the century. By investing in education and women’s rights, and raising people out of poverty, we could bring about peak human even sooner. This changes everything. It gives us the opportunity we need to regain our balance. The plan for our planet is remarkably simple, reduce our impact by making sure that everything we do we can do forever. For the biggest gains, we can concentrate our effort on 4 goals:\n\n\n1.  Phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with renewables. This will not only slow the warming of the planet and the acidification of the ocean, but it will lead to clean air for all. \n\n\n2. Upgrading to efficient food production and reducing our consumption of meat. We will require far less space to provide for ourselves, leaving more for grasslands, reducing deforestation and our demand for freshwater and feeding more people with healthier, more affordable food. \n\n\n3. Working together to properly manage our ocean. A global network of no fish zones and a treaty on the use of international oceans would restore the health of the ocean so that it actually produces more fish for us all to eat. \n4. Working hard to keep ahold of the wild populations we still have, encouraging nature wherever we can. In the ocean, on land we longer need and even in our cities. \n\n\nIf we make these changes, we will be a long way from becoming a species in balance with nature once again. We will have taken a remarkable journey from a million people struggling to survive to several billion living long, healthy lives on a stable planet able to provide for all our needs. Only at that point with the age of humans, the anthropocene, be truly underway. At that point we will be proud to call it our planet. How do we create a future in both which people and nature can thrive? We open our eyes to this moment in history, think on a planetary scale, embrace the challenge we face and do something we humans are very good at, change the world.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Kelly Lind", "channel": "UCCghaqFhWUUdUSyPA9t8RDw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuoGgBIrqn5DnrmjACunV6Rk6A5nkGqMfYGA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Give a bear (an omnivore) only fruit and vegetables and no meat and imagine how it will be.\nEvolution? You know how many years it takes to actually do a switch like that. Does our digestive system look like herbivores'? No. It doesn't even \"start\" to look like that. Evolution takes way too many years, not 50. Sedentary jobs or sitting in front of TV the whole night doesn't make us herbivores or less omnivores. Evolution happens as a need of something. As a mutation of a gene that suddenly becomes relevant and therefore more prevalent. I agree with you that we should eat way less meat. I'm the type of person that eats some meat once in two weeks, more often when I work out because I found out my body craves it. The evolution theory sounds good theoretically and maybe it will be like that in the future when we would need to adapt to the changing ecosystem.

So planting new trees is good, but saving the allready grown ones is better. So if we can avoid chopping trees it would be so much better. An example in my neighbourhood is they wanted to cut a tree down so they can put a bike road. One person stood up for the tree, claiming it’s not necessary to cut it down, as the bike road can easily be built around that tree. Luckily, they listened to her.

{"cid": "UgwAUGtjRBcGaerOQxZ4AaABAg", "text": "Little things that anyone at least in the western world can do to some degree: start looking for packaging that isnt plastic (we cant be perfect of course). If you see a product that is the same price in plastic as in recyclable packaging, use the ladt option. If you have finished a jar of olives or jam, clean it and you can use them for so many things (like storage or plant container or as tupperware). Always carry a small satchel or something with extra cuttlery (so when you are on the go you dont need a plastic one way utensil). You can use the left over jam jar as a travel coffee mug or invest in a reusable one. Single use coffe cups from like 30 people can already fill up a bin. Ditch single use cleaning wipes for the most part and use rags to clean and dishtowels to dry. Cook your own food and make a portion more and take it with you for lunch when you are at work. This will also save you money. There are tons of great meal preps that take only one hour a week in total for the whole week. Stop buying things like cake and cookies if they come in plastic packaging. Rather go either to a bakery or bake it yourself; we eat too much sugar anyways. Always carry a reusable bag with you in your backpack or purse even if you dont plan zo go shopping. How many times do we go into a store for one item only to come out with 10. Start hanging your laundry and dont use the dryer; it uses so so much electricty (not once in my life did i need a dryer). Look into your bathroom: try a bar soap for your hands and for body wash (just try it for a week) and you can use glas jars again for storing the bars. We did all these things before; our grandparents already did use reusables.

Oh yeah, just eat “less” meat. NO! if you’re serious about having a real impact, then go totally plant-based. Not everyone is going to go vegan, but if YOU do it, then you’ll actually be making the change that needs to be made. You might even encourage other people around you to take this seriously and make an actual difference instead of paying lip service too. The oceans are dying due to overfishing and pollution. It isn’t plastic straws that are killing the fish, IT’S US. Stop eating them. Stop taking the worlds grain supplies to feed your beef, and then complaining that only privilidged people can go vegan. If you’re eating meat, then you are the privilidged person. You are taking food away from starving children to feed your burger. You are taking clean water resources away from those who need them to produce your burger. You are actively contributing to the suffering of the planet, beyond even the suffering of that cow, to have your burger. \n\nAll this video is doing is having Winnie-the-Pooh tell you in a soothing voice that we need to do something, but like, maybe just do less bad. That way, you can look at the pretty pictures, exclaim how wonderful this video is, share it with your friends, feel so good about yourself and like you’re doing something while you nod and agree with the dulcet tones of the narrator, and then go right back to your life of eating all the beef, fish, chicken, and eggs. “BUT BACON THOUGH!” \n\nWell, at least you gave up plastic straws though, right? smh\n\nFail, WWF.

They can't help it that their parents generation were getting busy and producing big families. But, the boomers have made a big impact on consumerism.  With in 20 years time, expect a lot of funerals. Because the boomers are nearing the end of their life cycle. \n\n\n\nI also think we should give the US a little more credit. Because we do try to make an effort to clean our highways, roads and beaches clean. We have laws that help manage hunting and fishing practices.  We recycle and reuse. Are we perfect? No. But, we have been making an effort. We Americans generally prefer cleaner and safer cities. That's how most of us generally are.  But, we can't control the habits of other countries. \n\n\n\nI notice most of the images of big waste, is coming from 3rd world or developing countries. Places like India, are just know acknowledging, that they have a waste problem. But, it's not that easy to change an old culture and peoples old ways. Change usually comes from the younger generations. That one image looked like it was after a hurricane, earthquake or some kind of a big storm. Basically, try to look at things logically and not just give into your emotions.  I have anxiety disorders. I understand how stressful these images are. They stress you out because you care and you also feel helpless.  You want to do something, but it's beyond your control. So, you blame, pressure and lash out at people you don't know. You go into panic mode and you force society to change, with out really think how that is going to play out in reality. \n\n\n\nWe can't just get rid of cows and meat products. I hope you don't plan to feed your dog or cat  on a vegetarian diet, because that is animal abuse. What about all the people who are going to lose their jobs in these industries? More homelessness.  Have you ever noticed that where ever there is a lot of poverty and homelessness, there is more trash and waste? What people need is a job and the spending power to live a more healthier life style. The countries and cities with the most poverty and homelessness, create the most waste. Poor people have less control  over the changes they want in society.

And if we can't use these heartless, greedy humans for \"trophy hunting\" and have them stuffed at a taxidermist, let's put them all on a Space X rocket and open the hull in deep space so they become space trash. Then our world would become a much better, sustainable place and we could ensure our planet - and all her wondrous creations and species - are treated with respect and allowed to thrive. I will always fight for the protection of Earth and her animals...because that's the VERY least we owe for all the amazing and awe-inspiring wonders we've been given. How did we ever get to the point that our oceans are so polluted and the arctic ice is disappearing, yet the actions that caused this horrific damage CONTINUE? The greed and entitlement of humanity is repulsive.

Instead governments and all public and private agencies concerned need to focus on clearing up all forms of pollution globally, clearing the seas of plastic, abolish single use plastics globally, explore better ways of clean fossil fuel use blended with a pragmatic use of alternatives. We also need to abolish the use of private jets because many of the climate change advocates spend their time jetting round the world hypocritically gaining kudos for their humbug. We also must research even safer ways of using nuclear energy which is clean and exponential but which is dangerous when it leaks and in storage over long periods. Finally, here, we need a global system of recycling plastics, glass, metals, paper, organic refuse and packaging.\nFrankly speaking CO2 is food for plants and cannot be responsible for pollution. It is many of our negligences implied above which are. It is time to stop this fallacious and useless debate that has become a persecution of so-called \"deniers\" when the facts are often distorted by the proponents and the evidence can be countered by contrary indications.

Once the human population is done with, the earth will heal itself because that's what it does. It's a self healing organism. If you look at Chernobyl, that city hasn't been habited over 30 years and because of that, wildlife and the trees are returning and growing over its dead city without human interference. Earth will be fine but we're gonna be gone and even if we did save the planet, our species will eventually go extinct. There was once an Age of Fishes, then came the reptiles, now it's the age of primates but who knows? Maybe the insects will be next. It's not up to us we are here by chance and then we're gonna go away that's how life and evolution works. One species will have their chance to adapt to change and then the ones who can't will go away and the ones who adapt faster will live on.

Fusion power+banning single use plastics anywhere they aren't the only option. When you can cheaply and cleanly light a farm with grow lights, hydroponics becomes a viable option, it produces way more calories per unit area than classic agriculture, is more resource efficient and you can build farms up not out, removing the need to clear forests and deplete soils. More controlled hydroponic agricultural environments reduce the need for pesticides and eliminates the need for herbicides entirely, and pesticides wont be sprayed directly on the land making prevention of hazardous runoff far easier and they'll only be killing the insects that are a real problem instead of wild populations of insects and other animals caught in the crossfire. People don't need to tear their lives apart from the ground up to save the planet, or even spend much time on it. They just need to push for funding for the right technologies and strict but sensible government regulations for pollutants. This isn't some pie in the sky dreamed up nonsense, it has happened before. In the early to mid 20th century, just as they are in the developing world now, smogs were killing people in the streets across the developed world, waterways were so choked with trash and pollution rivers were catching fire, lead in the environment from fuels, hunting ammunition, trash and paints were poisoning people and wildlife alike, commercial whaling and overfishing were pushing the oceans to the brink but people pushed back against it, forced the hands of the governments and it Worked. The smogs vanished, the trash was cleaned up, lead paints and ammunition were banned, strict rules about what could and could not be dumped into lakes and rivers were put in place. natural areas were preserved and protected, as were species on  the brink of extinction, and they rebounded. Bald eagles in the US were pushed to the edge of extinction in the lower 48 states of the US, with less than 500 breeding pairs remaining in the mid 60s, but with a hunting and sale ban on them, and chemicals like DDT that were hurting their populations and their prey, their population in the lower 48 today is more than ten times higher. Nature is tough, and it Will rebound, ecosystems will recover, animals on the brink of extinction will return to their historic ranges with just a little help and protection.

{"cid": "UgwsMiepj_DoIA3rSTJ4AaABAg", "text": "It's not the animals, fish, chickens, etc that are causing the problem with the environment. It's how the raising of them is being handled by the mega-producers. Back in the day when there were only \"one million\" of us, we had to hunt for our meat and forage for our greens. The meat didn't come from the supermarket, we had to go out and really work hard for it using very basic traps and tools to capture and kill it. There were no guns then, only the basic wooden spear, rocks, cliffs to run animals off of, etc. That's why we didn't eat very much meat back then. It was hard to come by. Now we go get it from the supermarket. Did you know that there are pastures in Texas, Australia, and other places that were so ruined with over-grazing and poor land management that are now being brought back to life by the current owners with simple land management practices? For instance, moving the cattle on a regular basis from pasture to pasture. This allows the grass in the grazed pasture to grow back and get long again, while the other pasture is being used. Planting NATIVE grasses and trees, cleaning up springs and streams on their land that have been clogged with dirt, rocks, and detritus. There are videos on here about many places and people that are re-greening their land, reclaiming the desert areas, etc. Check them out.  And while I am on the subject of what's what and who's who - Please, everyone, stop telling other people what they should and shouldn't be eating. If somebody wanted to change their way of eating, they would.  Just like those who have already done so. And, as Jonathan Geffen, stated on here 2 weeks ago, the place to start changing the world is with yourself. I am currently in the process of planting \"edibles\" on my little property that will also help keep the air in my little town clean, such as fruit and nut trees, medicinal bushes, plants, and flowers. That's what I can do and am doing.

Permaculture is a design system which shows the advantages of integrating the natural world with our food systems. We need to encourage beneficial insects and birds to help in controlling the pests. In permaculture are many examples of how food can be grown on a commercial scale to the benefit of the wildlife, soil and humans. Permaculture provides so many answers to our problems on this planet. The best thing about it is that we can all do this! We can all be empowered to make a positive change and regenerate this planet. Permaculture can be done on any scale, even a small garden.

Think about the tactics they use, we see, hear, and feel all this racism, feminism, multiculturalism, etc. They don't even need obedient workers anymore they now can automate and use robots.

I do believe this is why we see the agendas being pushed today. \n\nDid you know President George W. Bush bought 298,840 acres of land in Paraguay? Bush did not buy this land for any other reason besides the fact that it sits on top of the biggest aquifer on planet earth. Aquifer Guarani covers roughly 460,000 square miles under parts of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. What do you think this world will look like when water is the new GOLD? What do you want for your children? For this planet? The Animals? The universe? Humanity does not have to be this horible plauge that destroys everything it touches, but we are choosing to be everyday we do nothing to fix it. \n\nGeorge Carlin said, \"The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They've long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying. Lobbying, to get what they want.\n\nWell, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interests.\"\n\nHe is right, they do not want people uniting, so they make all the ISMS to divide us. \"Racism\", \"Multiculturalism\", \"Feminism\", etc.etc. \nThey have done a damn good job. We need forward thinking, logical, hardworking people to overcome, and everyone has lost hope.\n\nThis planet needs a whole new system. https://youtu.be/KphWsnhZ4Ag The Choice is Ours. The people need to remove political agendas along with having the open-mindedness and willingness to overcome. I know this would take many many moons to achieve but a change is already on its way, and so far its looking like whites are going to be the blame for everything throughout history, and this is why we are watching white genocide take place all over the world today, and no one is saying anything about it. Only the winners write history and we are losing this war so far. We have some huge decisions to make. Do we want to RULE this planet, rid this country of all other races, and bully the world taking all the power we can, or do we want peace, and trust that \"all men are created equal\"? \nNo men are created equal under this monetary system.

They are p resenting no science all they do is blame the regular people and say it’s our fault. I don’t know about you but I don’t own or travel in private jets, I can bet that most of you don’t either. They have been pushing this agenda since the 1930 and gave date after date of when we were supposed to reach the point of no return. Mostly though what they’ve done is appeal to our compassion and of course we all want to do the right thing. Keep something in mind even if we start riding bicycles there are enough of them that the impact would be minimal. The former head of NOAA resigned a few years ago and tried to let us know that the numbers are cooked in order for the funds to continue coming into the organizations. I love our planet and respect it immensely but please have a look https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/07/former-noaa-scientist-colleagues-manipulated-climate-change-data-for-political-reasons . Please I would strongly suggest that if we really love this planet and respect one another then we should really look into things instead of listening ing to the people who cause most of the animals that went extinct in the last century due to them hunting them into extinction. Lastly these same people are the ones who got us addicted to gasoline in the first place by suppressing other technologies and a great  example is the electric car that was invented went into production and was killed in the late 1920’s this was because they had all the oil and wood industries under their belts and so forced petroleum down our throats. The same people telling us it was our fault. There are many example of what I’ve said and I know most of you will just be upset with me but there are thousands of scientists that have come forward and disproved these BS models that people like Al Gore who wants us to live in a 200 square foot home to save the planet but yet he lives in a 10,000 square foot mansion and this is just one of many https://www.dailywire.com/news/19275/mr-hypocrisy-al-gores-huge-estate-used-21-times-hank-berrien   Of course we need to change the way we live but unless they change what we will do will be futile.   \n\nRevelation 11:18\n“And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.” \n\n\nPeace", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Ascanius", "channel": "UC_cS6GwUOCKNLzeKF5pfCpw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSeXTetTGGl4PyLbTAon0JdKzTx3cZFKyHjQEEBDA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That will cause overpopulation and that will cause many and many people becoming unemployed etc. And at the end of this all the food supplies will drop because the animals are dying because the main sources of the food chain (plants, trees, grass) will be gone because of global warming. Then if we don't have clean water or food we are going to die of starvation. We will have to wear gas mask because they say that breathing that air is just like smoking, imagine little kids trying to breath but instead having to smell the fumes of gas released by their ancestors.

In the past, the goal was only to survive and reproduce, maybe enjoy nature, if youre doing good.. But now we still invent  new inventions and go on with our lives and bring gasses into the air till we are all broken and more animals will die and there will be less and less nature. But there is nothing will done about it and people who are born new didnt choose for this, our ancestors and the people nowadays did this.\n\n\nThis isnt fully good english but thats because i first Wrote it in Dutch and translated it and edited it.   But a few thousand years ago we only tried to survive and now humanity has come so far that we can survive so easily, the goal is not to survive anymore so we don't know what to do.

To be clear, animal agriculture is according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations currently the leading cause for climate change. Moreover, it is the leading cause for rainforest desctruction, water pollution, ozean deadzones and habitat destructions. Just watch \"cowspiracy\", it is a good start to inform yourself. For more information I would suggest reading directly reports from the FAO (e.g. \"Livestock's long shadow\"). So changing the food on you plate is the easiest and most efficient step to lower your emissions.\n\nOf course, cars are still polluting the air, that’s why I also recommended in my original comment to use the bike as often as possible. 2018 the oxford university published a paper called “Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers”, in which they examined the most sustainable diet. The result: a purely plant-based diet. Why? For example: around 83% of the world’s farmland is used by livestock, but animal products only deliver around 18% of the world’s calories. Totally inefficient!\n\nPlants cannot feel, because they have no central nervous system (brain), which is necessary to feel or suffer (according to current science). But let’s imagine plants do have feelings: What do you think livestock gets feed up with? You need around 7 calories of (for humans eatable) plants to get 1 calorie from animal products. Again, Totally inefficient! So by going vegan you are still \"killing\" less plants. And lets be real, mowing your lawn is not the same as slitting someones throat. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I ate a lot of animal products and I loved them. But the ethical, environmental and health arguments are just overwhelming.

{"cid": "Ugy2abog_5JGDwXSead4AaABAg", "text": "Interesting video. I must applaud the very first point that was brought to attention (having less children) and I totally agree with changing our energy sector as well. However, WWF needs to explain more in depth the consequences of our food choices. \"Reducing our consumption of meat\" : come on WWF, you can - and must - do way better ! It's time to properly address the problems and tell individuals that our best way - and certainly the easiest one - to make a difference in order to try to minimize our individual footprint is to eat a whole food plant based diet. It seems you do acknowledge humans need to reduce their consumption of meat. Why don't you go further? Why don't you tell people to stop eating meat at all? Is it too challenging for such a big organization to go against what the majority of people are doing? Unfortunately, the issue of fishing has not been properly addressed either. It must be understood that any type of fishing will have a negative impact on the oceans. If we really want to look after the oceans, we must stop any  activities in those oceans. By leaving them entirely alone, oceans will heal. It must also be clearly understood that the oceans do not need humans but that humans do need the oceans. If the oceans die, humans die. If humans die, the oceans will flourish. I wish WWF would properly assess the food items that are the most sustainable - in an optimal-relative sustainability standpoint - and share their findings. After doing this exercice, we certainly would not hear that we have to reduce our consumption of meat. We would actually hear that we have to stop (to bring to zero) our consumption of meat and of any animal products. So again, the best action an individual can implement in her/his day to day life is to stop eating animal and animal products. The power lies in our hands as consumers. If there is no demand, no supply will be provided as there won't be any money to make. Keep in mind, it is never too late to change and to decide to eat a whole food plant based diet.

You think Hitler stood on a stage talking about burning millions of jews and ruling the world? NO!!!!!!! Absolutely not. His speeches sounded crazy  because you can't understand german and the german language just sounds mean. Hitler promised to take the wealth from the jews and spread it to the germans. Hitler promised to take the guns from the jews and raise the taxes on them. Hitler promised to ban certain speech and ban platforms that opposed him. Hitler sent his goons in Colleges  and they stood in classrooms and when someone said something they opposed they yelled and intimidated them. They were literally known as \"fascist''. Brown Shirts of germany shut down freedom of speech AKA fascism. Hitler stood on a stage promising free healthcare and welfare. The \"NSDAP\"   National Socialist German Workers' Party  AKA Nazi were national socialist. \nNationalist means governed nationally. Plain and simple. Globalism is ideologies governed globally. Did hitler push is ideologies nationally or did he try to take over the world and push his crap world wide BUT.... That would be Nationally if he owned everything I guess. The confederates were democrats. 1854 the Republican Party was created to stop slavery. Since then it has NEVER changed its main policies which are Equality, Freedom of speech, Low taxes and gun rights. KKK was created by William joseph simmons, a democrat. Was literally created to combat the republican party. Only people that claim there was a switch is on the democrat side. Just find the policy they switched on blindly saying one side was conservative while other was liberal... Is not a policy. Name the policy.  4 years and no one can name the policy when I ask people. Demographics isn't policy. Thats voters. I don't vote on what others vote on ... I vote on policies that I believe in. \n\nThere is zero evidence climate change is man made.

From increased CO2 concentration?\n\n\nLemmie give you a grade 3 run down on atmospheric composition. \n\n\nNitrogen 78.08%\nOxygen 20.94%\nArgon 0.93%\nALL OTHER GASSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE... LESS THAN 0.1% \n\n\nDo you even KNOW the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere? it's just under 400ppm. That's 0.04% Can you read? ZERO POINT ZERO FOUR PERCENT. In fact, alarmists say constantly that CO2 concentration is the HIGHEST it has ever been... That is true, the upper limit centuries ago was 300ppm, not it's just below 400ppm. This catastrophically alarming change of CO2 concentration is a change from 0.03% to 0.04%. \n\n\nAre you aware that of all greenhouse gasses, water vapour in the atmosphere has between a 85% and 95% impact on 'global warming'? Water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere are a FAR more effective greenhouse gas than CO2. They don't tell you that on the propaganda news channels, it doesn't really suit an alarmist agenda well. Water vapour is 95% of the greenhouse effect, CO2 is 3.6% of the greenhouse effect and that massive increase of 100pp, from 0.03% of the atmosphere to 0.04% of the atmosphere is going to turn us into Venus in a century or two, right? Bullshit, water vapour is the main greenhouse gas, not CO2... Look it up, there's even a wikipedia page on it. \n\n\nIn fact, scientifically illiterate alarmists such as yourself often say we're on a path to a runaway greenhouse atmosphere that will lead up to Venus. In fact, the SPECIFIC argument being made is that CO2 concentration is the HIGHEST it's been since 1750. Yes, in TWO AND A HALF CENTURIES the global temperature has risen a massive 0.8 degrees Celcius and the CO2 concentration has skyrocketed a massive 100ppm from 0.03% to 0.04%. Hold up... Lemmie get back to you in 50 years when we're literally sitting at a CO2 concentration of 95.6% and a temperature of 860 degrees Celcius because we're literally in a runaway greenhouse atmosphere.\n\n\nLet me guess, next you're going to try and tell me global warming is going to give us fucking cancer or Alzheimers or some bullshit like that? \n\n\n\"being driven into poverty by ever rising food costs, suffering from water shortages and living spaces due to mass migrations\" \n\n\nYou think 'global warming' causes poverty? Fucking hell you're retarded. You realise the effects of the proposed 'climate change' extend the growing season of many crops and increased levels of CO2 improve plant growth? By exactly what means do you think 'global warming' creates a ride in food costs? By making it grow better? I'd ask if you could get more retarded, but I'm afraid you'd say yes. Water shortages, shortage of living spaces? No interpretation of global warming, no matter how alarmist and based in fantasy can be misconstrued to suggest it causing a land shortage or whatever you're suggesting to force mass migration... Fuck you're actually a dictionary definition retard. Mass migrations are caused by socially torn countries because they're run by fucking retards such as yourself which fuck up the entire society and make the smart ones want to flee to countries that aren't complete fucking shitholes, like the entire West. Though with more and more people like you, that may change soon. \n\n\nWhy don't you go and tell me how you supposed 'climate change' creates water shortages? You do realise the vast majority of the world obtains water from aquifers and other groundwater supplies? I'd image the words 'global warming' make you and other illiterate fools picture dried up lakes and rivers, which is why you ask, I'd like a demonstration of you stumbling over the science you don't understand and clearly haven't read... You know, unlike me. \n\n\n\"all just to finally die in your arms from every cancer imaginable.\"\n\n\nI fucking called it, I knew you would fucking try to link in cancer or Alzheimers somehow and you fucking did. Let me just quote myself predicting it.\n\n\n\"Let me guess, next you're going to try and tell me global warming is going to give us fucking cancer or Alzheimers or some bullshit like that?\"\n\n\n\"We are killing off our planet's ecosystems, and we rely on them. \"\n\n\nYes, we are... We are cutting down forests at an alarming rate, we are polluting waterways and oceans, we are overfishing like the fucking things are unlimited in the seas and we are causing mass extinctions through irresponsible land clearing practices and harmful agriculture... But NONE OF THIS IS GLOBAL WARMING OR CLIMATE CHANGE YOU VAPID FUCKING MONG! Global warming doesn't exist, it's a myth, the Earth is not in a runaway greenhouse atmosphere leading to venus and there is no fucking 'no point of return' much let us having already passed such a stage as most alarmists dictate. You don't understand, 99.999% of the Earths processes are known as NEGATIVE feedback loops. It helps the planet maintain stability, like a kind of homeostasis... There is not a magical single exception where 'global warming' is a positive feedback loop leading to Venus in just a few centuries. Global warming is a myth, it's an alarmist political agenda and only scientifically illiterate people such as yourself who don't read or can't read believe this shit. \n\n\nMeanwhile, we could be doing productive things to save the planet such as switching to clean and save modern nuclear energy and practicing sustainable farming practices but instead we're wasting all our money and resources on regressive fucking nonsense such as windmills and solar cells for grid wide energy which are unsustainable, unreliable, intermittent, expensive and highly polluting and costly to produce. \n\n\n\"regardless of your little conspiracy theory.\"\n\n\n> Global warming is going to give my children asthma... From increased CO2 concentration?\n> all just to finally die in your arms from every cancer imaginable.\n\n\n'Facts'\n\n\n> Global warming is a myth and here's some very solid basic science which disproves the alarmism \n> Stable planets can't exist with positive feedback loops, they have to be negative feedback loops\n\n\n'conspiracy theory' \n\n\nOk fuckwit... Why would I have any reason to disbelieve you? After all, you've been a bastion of intelligence thus far. \n\n\n\"It's not alarmism\"\n\n\nNoooooo... Of course not.\n\n\n\"it's just an alarm that's been ringing since the 70s, but people like you\"\n\n\nYour whole reply all you've done is drop insults and say exactly nothing of even remote intelligence or respectability... I've dropped some seriously basic science that even children could understand... I've made an actual argument. But again, you're such a bastion of intelligence, why would I have any reason to disbelieve you? \n\n\n\"You know, I hope you never have kids.\"\n\n\nBelieve me when I say this because it comes right from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely hope I don't have kids either because the depression of being forced to live in a world full or moronic mongs such as yourself and your scientifically illiterate offspring shouting you're alarmist political bullshit is near certain to drive my children to suicide and I'd hate to see that. Unless Mr Musk makes great progress on his exoplanet business ventures and prices the tickets for such a trip very highly almost certainly excluding illiterate cretins such as yourself and your offspring from ever being able to afford a ticket whilst allowing bright and successful individuals such as my offspring a chance to leave this world and escape the barbaric and prehistoric ideologies of your kind then my children will have no hope for a happy life, there are just too many people like you out there.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jordan Huckel", "channel": "UCMeZYWI2mrim4c_y34wMG4g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSM87VVr57EtNqlfI42XimeYHUFnXvHA_rWBnzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Now when this was first figured out, it was a secret, and instead of stopping, ExxonMobil prepared for it by making their rigs higher up in the ocean. Then the rest of the world figured this out and it became a panic. Then, oil companies started to pay politicians to deny it and now it's a political issue.

All of the replies to me have one thing in common... You're all acting as though I haven't read any of the science on global warming... You know, like all you guys who are replying to me, who have clearly not read any science on global warming. \n\n\n\"All of this started in the 70s, when scientists for ExxonMobil and other companies started figuring out that the c02 emissions into our atmosphere is causing the greenhouse effect\"\n\n\nNo, you're wrong, you know nothing. The media and the alarmist politicians have always said that 'there is a 97% consensus' on climate change amongst all scientists. There have been exactly zero studies with the hypothesis 'if CO2 emissions are increased then global temperatures would rise.' There isn't a SINGLE scientific study stating the truth of any global warming hypothesis... But I know what you're going to do, you haven't seen it but the media told you it's true so you're going to scream 'you're an idiot denier at me.' Let me say that again - NO CAUSAL LINK between CO2 and temperature. \n\n\nIt's ok, they did that to Aristotle too. \n\n\n\"All of this started in the 70s\"\n\n\nActually no, it didn't. There was a sharp climactic warming in the 1920's a number of alarmists started the 'sea rise myth' and forecast apocalyptic predictions of sea level rise which would swollow up Manhattan and low lying islands by mid century. Of course, with a total of 8 inches of sea rise over the last 150 years, this is complete bullshit... But don't worry, no hard feelings on you, I wouldn't expect you to know anything that would require you to read or think critically, that's too much to ask of most people these days. Obviously, I don't expect you to know about the 1920's warming and sea rise alarmism either, that would require you actually being there to know it happened... Or, you know, actually read anything in your entire life rather than just digesting feel-good propaganda. \n\n\nSo what did ExxonMobil know? Pulled from a random article:\n\n\n\"But ExxonMobil disagrees that any of its early statements were so stark, let alone conclusive at all. “We didn’t reach those conclusions, nor did we try to bury it like they suggest,” ExxonMobil spokesperson Allan Jeffers tells Scientific American. “The thing that shocks me the most is that we’ve been saying this for years, that we have been involved in climate research. These guys go down and pull some documents that we made available publicly in the archives and portray them as some kind of bombshell whistle-blower exposé because of the loaded language and the selective use of materials.”\"\n\n\nBasically that, Exxon was conducting their own internal research and didn't act on the inconclusive data because why the fuck would you have an alarmist tantrum when the data suggests nothing? Then, they published a lot of their internal environmental research, actually, most of their internal environmental research and ALL the 'climate change' science conducted by ExxonMobil was put in public domain for free access. As the article states, they hid nothing, it wasn't worth acting on and still isn't, but because they're not a criminal corporation, they put all their data and research in the public domain. Now, with the ExxonKnew conspiracy, biased eco-activists have dug up these EASILY obtainable public domain documents and have blatantly lied to portray them, as the article states, as some kind of bombshell whistle-blower expose which Exxon tried to bury and hide from the world. You can't claim that shit when you can literally Google it to find the info, nothing was hidden, nothing was buried, it was all publically available and always has been.\n\n\nOk but guilt by association right? If #ExxonKnew about climate change before everyone else, why did they quietly sweep it under the rug by publishing literally all of their research into public domain that literally anyone can Google? Why didn't they speak up about the impending doomsday so that we'd all know? Because Exxon didn't fucking discover shit, they weren't cutting edge and they didn't know anything before anyone else. They may have had the drop on data before the general public because vapid mongs like yourself know nothing about the world because you don't read and stay informed, but Exxon wasn't ahead of the trend in science - scientists were already studying climate change conspiracies and theories. 'Climate change' conspiracies isn't something Exxon just stumbled upon in the 70's and buried, climate change conspiracies first arose in the very late 1800's, then resurfaced again in the 1920's with the globes rapid warming over a short period, then AGAIN these conspiracies arose in the 1950's and 60's. 'Climate change' was nothing new when Exxon jumped in on the science, it was already being studied in the 70's and had been toyed with for 2 decades prior. \n\n\nClimate change myths have literally circled for over 120 years. Exxon discovered nothing new, in fact, if they even discovered anything of material worth, even if it was of already known science, then it would be immediately reflected in their investment habits. Maybe all those rich people bunkers aren't being built to survive world war 3 or the lizard people invasion... Maybe the bunkers are there to survive climate change!

We are polluting the air with pollutants (not CO2, ACTUAL pollutants), we are polluting the oceans, we are overfishing, we are cutting down forests at alarming rates, we are destroying VITAL ecosystems which act as buffer zones for natural Earth processes and we are poisoning the lands and waterways with improper management of industrial waste. But NONE of those things is climate change, none of those things is anthropogenic CO2 emissions causing catastrophic destruction from less that a single degree of global warming over the last 150 years. \n\n\nDestroying the fucking environment with habitat destruction and pollution at an alarming rate is a very real thing... Climate change is not... Especially CO2 driven climate change. \n\n\nAnd the biggest problem? All this CO2 alarmism is just a political agenda for higher taxes hatched by eco-fascists and greedy politicians. We could be spending these billions of dollars and all this research effort on restoring the environment, sustainable agricultural practices, more environmentally conscious industrial practices, water desalination, responsible handling of industrial waste, clean and efficient nuclear and planting more god damn trees but instead we're wasting all these resources, time, money, research on a myth! I'd hate to say it, but the hippies were right. Not the eco-fascist idealogues that use any excuse they can to assault people and damage property, I mean the OG peace loving hippies that just want the destruction to stop... They were right, we need to plant more trees... That is almost all we have to do, plant more trees and stop destroying habitats. \n\n\n\"Well I'd hope learning directly from scientists and researching for a month\"\n\n\nAn unverifiable claim doesn't over-ride the fact that you are factually wrong... On the other hand, no wonder you know so fucking little if you've only be \"researching for a month.\" Fucking hell, I've spent more time researching on first-year university assignments... Fucking hell, I spent more than a month researching for a paper of Vaorra Mite and the significance of native and managed bee populations in environmental stability and economic productivity of food crops and other profitable crops. If indeed you're not talking straight out of your fucking ass and trying to force and appeal to authority fallacy in place of any actual knowledge or data, then the fact that you've only studied a month explains perfectly why you know so little. Hell, I've studied more than you over the last couple of years in just my personal time after my economically productive job. It's a shame some of my tax dollars were wasted having vapid morons like you waste 4 weeks to learn nothing on the taxpayer's payroll. Maybe you're the reason the world is failing, because instead of telling idiots like you to get fucked, you just get a month to study something on taxpayer money and then act like you're an expert. Maybe we should go back to the rewards by merit method humanity used prior, where scientists would have to self fund their own research for years as I do and actually find something worth talking about before they even had a second wasted listening to their ideas.\n\n\n\"we are destroying the earth and you are one if the biggest reasons why Jordan.\"\n\n\nBecause I think for myself, conduct my own research and study, think critically and advocate for productive changes to push humanity forwards rather than just digesting propaganda and blindly conforming to the factually incorrect opinions of people such as yourself with zero merits? Oh how very scientific of you to say such a thing like that.\n\n\nHave you noticed a pattern between what I say and what the people who reply to me say? \n\n\nI say: I've read the data, I've read the science, I've thought independently, it's all there in the open, stop listening to the media and politicians and do your own research. Go READ something and learn the truth, use your brain and think for your self. \n\n\nEveryone replying to me, including you, says: You're a retard, you're a retard, you're an idiot, you're a climate denier, no one should listen to you, no one listen to this climate denier moron, don't listen to anything they have to say, you're everything wrong with this world, don't do your own research anyone, don't listen to this person that provides data and research to back his arguments he's a conspiracy theorist, don't listen to him, no one think for yourselves, listen to me!

Society has slowly learned that despite the initially unpopular opinion, facts and logic eventually prevail and the side denouncing pay gap, feminist diatribe and accusations of widespread racism and likely right. \n\n\nI wonder how long it will be until society at large notices that in several scientific issues, there is a similar divide between a loud voice of personal attacks and 'listen to me not this conspiracy theorist' and a side talking with level headed data and facts. I wonder, when society at large recognises this divide, what will they think?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jordan Huckel", "channel": "UCMeZYWI2mrim4c_y34wMG4g", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSM87VVr57EtNqlfI42XimeYHUFnXvHA_rWBnzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This means that below 4 degrees and above 4 degrees, the oceans expand slightly, causing them to rise... Well, that's not accurate, the oceans are temperature stratified and the depth of which oceans expand is roughly to the extent that light permeates, thus to the depth that the sun can light and warm the oceans. So even in that case, when we say the oceans expand as the warm above 4 degrees Celcius, we don't mean the entire volume of the ocean expands, we mean only the top layer, well actually the thermocline, of which I believe is roughly 800m of depth between 200m, and 1,000m. \n\n\nOn the other hand, when you talk about 'ice caps' are you referring to the Arctic ice caps? Did you know the arctic ice caps are sea ice? Not only are they actually expanding slowly but conspiracy alarmist photos of the 'ice caps melting' are always during the summer months. Just to clarify, it is entirely normal for the ice caps to melt during summer then re-expand during winter, this has been happening for hundreds of years, way before we figured out we can burn coal. Further, the Arctic ice caps are predominantly sea ice. The beauty of basic physics with sea ice is that sea ice (icebergs) float due to their displacement of water, but they are composed of water which means when they melt they have a net zero change in sea rise. However, what is different is that the rising temperatures which would cause the sea ice to melt would already cause the thermocline to expand slightly, due to it being above 4 degrees Celcius. So to say, 'melting sea ice' does not cause any sea level rise, but rather a natural warming of oceans causes thermocline expansion, which causes the sea levels to rise, but which also cause sea ice to melt due to rising temperature, which in of itself causes a net zero effect. \n\nDid you get that? Water expands as it gets warmer, that causes the sea level to rise by fractions of a millimetre, but due to the water becoming warming, icebergs also melt - but those melting icebergs don't actually cause any sea rise themselves.\n\nHowever, to touch on what you're suggesting - melting ice caps causes sea level rise, am I right? The Antarctic is expanding, the Arctic is expanding. The only significant effector of sea level, in terms of ice, is land mass ice. Sea ice - icebergs - have a net zero effect because they're floating, land ice, in fact, would increase sea levels, were it to melt. The only significant mass of land ice which may affect sea levels is upon Greenland. Luckily, 'they', the scientists, have already determined the sea level rise, were all the ice on Greenland to melt. About 7m. \n\nAs in, if the global temperature were to warm so much that the entirety of Greenland were to be above 0 degrees Celcius, thus causing all the ice to melt, scientists predict that the additional water from this ice sheet on land would cause a sea level rise of 7m. Will this happen? I don't know, the one thing I am not is dishonest, I haven't done any research into the extent of which the globe would have to warm in order for all of Greenland's ice to melt but I would have to ballpark it at Centuries of humans doing literally everything in their power to destroy the environment and increase temperature as fast as possible. \n\nOne thing is certain though, all scientists agree that Greenland is melting... Very slowly... Literally at a glacial rate. This is true, Greenland is melting, it has been since the end of the last ice age. They don't expect it not to melt... Because we're not in an ice age. \n\n\nWell, that's all the data I know off the top of my head... Sorry if I didn't completely answer what you're looking for, unlike most people I don't talk out my ass and just say listen to me blindly and don't think for yourself. In fact, I blatantly advocate thinking for oneself and doing your own reading and research... Just... Steer away from mainstream news sources, they're notoriously alarmist and inaccurate...

It HASN'T been proven... It's been hypothesised. A scientific hypothesis is when you say 'if this is changed, then that will happen.' I am damn near certain you have heard on the TV that global warming is a fact and no doubt that there's a 97% consensus that global warming is real. You've heard this from politicians and the media - not scientists, not climatologists, not meteorologists, not core sample researchers... Politicians.\n\n\nI've read the science, I've directly read the studies. I've read the various hypothesis, the arguments and counter arguments. I've read it all... Global warming as it stands, global warming as it is portrayed by alarmists in the media, is a myth. You haven't read the science, you don't understand the arguments... But you've got something far better than independent thought and scientific literacy - someone on the media told you that someone else told them that nearly all scientists agree with global warming, that it is a fact. \n\nTell me, just quickly, because I've answered every question asked of me in this thread and I've proven my stance, no doubt all the science has gone over the head of anyone who disagrees with me. If global warming is, in fact, real, is that the only positive feedback loop observed in nature? Or are there other positive feedback loops present in nature? Can you list any of them?\n\n\"Long waves of radiation from the sun enter our atmosphere. The waves then reflect off the earth's surface which causes them to become short waves of radiation. These short waves travel in a different way to the long waves which makes it more difficult for the radiation to travel back out of the atmosphere. Due to a layer of greenhouse gases which is becoming more and more dense, less and less of the short wave radiation is able to escape which is in short raising the temperature of earth and the atmosphere. \"\n\nTruly spoken like someone with not a single fucking clue that learned their entire understanding of 'global warming' from a 5 minute animated YouTube video. On one hand, I applaud you for going out there and trying to learn something rather than just parroting the propaganda fed to you like other people here... But on the other hand, a 5 minute animated YouTube video doesn't make you a fucking expert. \n\n\nFirstly, it doesn't come in long and exit short... The suns radiation is SHORT wave radiation, i.e. UV, UltraViolet light radiation. Secondly, when it reflects of various elements of the Earths surface, it becomes LONG wave radiation, i.e. IR, InfraRed light radiation. Thirdly, I'm almost certain that you're running off the complete misconception that UV light enters the atmosphere, is reflected off of the Earth's surface and then is trapped by 'greenhouse gasses.' This isn't correct, much of the UV radiation is reflected back into the atmosphere by clouds and water vapour and of the radiation which reaches the surface of the Earth, most is absorbed by the soil, rocks and ground, only about 3% is reflected back into the atmosphere. Did you catch that? Only three percent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface is reflected back as infrared radiation to potentially be trapped by greenhouse gasses. \n\nWhat's the chance that it's trapped by greenhouse gasses? I'd say potentially quite high, after all, water vapour and clouds are 95% of the greenhouse gas effect. Yep, CO2 contributes about 3.6% to global warming, water vapour carries the other 95% of the greenhouse effect. \n\nOk so the relative impact of CO2 may be pathetically minor but surely there's like a massive shit tonne of CO2 in the atmosphere right? Having a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere would mean that it would have a HUGE impact, that would prove once and for all that you are in fact the genius and I am just a crazy global warming denying conspiracist. \n\nHere's a basic rundown of atmospheric composition.\n\nNitrogen 78.08%\nOxygen 20.94%\nArgon 0.93%\nALL other gasses in the atmosphere, less than 0.05%\n\n\nIn fact, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is only 400ppm. I would suspect you've heard that CO2 concentration is the highest it has ever been - where it used to have a high point of 0.03%, it now has a high point of 0.04%, that's an increase of 300ppm to 400ppm. So 0.04% of the entire atmosphere is CO2, of all greenhouse effect water vapour composes 95% of the impact and CO2 composes 3.6% of the impact and of all the UV radiation that reaches Earth's surface, 3% is radiated back to the atmosphere as infrared radiation, to be trapped by the 0.04% of the atmosphere that has an effect which is 3.6% of the total greenhouse effect? \n\nAnd all this adds together to create a glacially slow warming effect that is certain to create a runaway greenhouse atmosphere that will turn is into Venus... In what is it, 200 years? \n\nAre you aware that in the last 150 years the atmosphere has warmed by a total of 0.8 degrees Celcius? Also in that same time the oceans have risen a massive 8 inches... Yep, don't mind me, just reading up on actual science and thinking for myself whilst I figure out how we're going to go from a 0.8 degree Celcius increase in temperature and an atmospheric CO2 level of 0.04% at an increase of 0.01% over a period of 150 years to a Venus-like hell stacking on an additional 820 degrees Celcius and increasing the CO2 concentration to 95% in the following 1-2 centuries.\n\n\"Due to a layer of greenhouse gases which is becoming more and more dense, less and less of the short wave radiation is able to escape which is in short raising the temperature of earth and the atmosphere.\" \n\n\nWell yeah, if you told me to explain it to someone in an extremely basic but also incorrect manner, that's probably what I'd say... It's showing through immensely that you really don't have even the most rudimentary understanding of global warming theory.\n\n\"It's not politics, it's science.\"\n\nWhat you said definitely isn't science... Coincidentally, it sounds straight out of a political speech... It is politics, 100% If indeed it's science and not politics, tell me, how do you plan to solve 'climate change' without simply taxing carbon? You see, despite the fact that climate change is a myth, I can easily devise several very effective solutions to solve such a dilemma...

I've been reading up on supercritical fluids (don't worry, I understand that you have NO fucking clue what that is, nor do you have the capacity to ever understand) and I've been reading up on how supercritical CO2 turbines could revolutionise energy production bringing about space-age efficiencies and driving down the costs of energy to astronomically low levels. \n\nHere's the quote: \"Put simply, using sCO2 as the working fluid means it takes less work to convert a given amount of thermal input to electricity, regardless of the source of heat (fossil fuel, nuclear, or solar). The mixture is also non-toxic, non-flammable, inert, available inexpensively in a pure form, and does not damage the environment if there is a leak or spill.\" \n\nDoes not damage the environment if there is a leak or spill? What the fuck! CO2 is probably the *WORST* thing for the environment... It's actually really funny, sometimes I just completely forget that outside of political climate alarmism, there's an invisible consensus among most actual scientists that climate change is absolute bullshit. \n\nOk yeah, climate change is a myth, that's no surprise to anyone with a brain and a measurable amount of literacy, but I know you'll accuse me of just dodging the question 'therefore proving I'm wrong' if I don't at least humour your statement. Well, I'll cut straight to the chase, you, like everyone else who is scientifically illiterate, isn't actually forming the opinion that climate change is real due to a thorough reading of climatology and the many contradictory theories... \n\nLike most people, you, are just a braindead retard that balances most of your 'climate change truth' opinion on alarmism a false authority stats such as '97% of scientists agree that climate change exists, this isn't up for debate.' The alarming and perhaps tragically scary thing about you not actually having a brain or thinking for yourself, is that if tomorrow all the scientists said \"actually it's all bullshit, climate change is a politically charged myth and we're sick of perpetuating this bullshit just to milk climate grant money, 97% of scientists actually agree that climate change doesn't exist\" then you would change your opinion so fucking fast - you'd change your opinion faster than a communist declaring their hatred of capitalism the second they're forced to stand in a communist bread line for stale sourdough... It's at that point that all the communists admit that they do indeed love capitalist bread creations such as Krispy Kremes and Pizza Hut over stale fucking sourdough breadlines.\n\n\nI digress, 97%, where does this blatant fucking myth come from?\n\nWell, this data-point comes solely from the author of a site called 'skepticalscience', his name is John Cook. The stat comes from the fact that John surveyed a bunch of papers and declared that among those, 97% share a consensus of human perpetuated climate change. I'm not going to even delve into the shit show of blatant stakeholder bias and intentionally vague language to force a hypothesis, I don't need to because an economist named David Friedman publically challenged this slimy fucking cunt on his apocalypse alarmism and in doing so an independent observer calculated the number of papers reviewed and showed that only 1.6% supported the alarmist hypothesis... \n\nOh yes.. But it gets better... Not only is it not 97% consensus of all scientists, it's not even 97% consensus of scientists surveyed... It was, 97% consensus of PAPERS SURVEYED. I could in general support climate mythology but then publish a single paper which challenged it and according to this twat hotdog, I would be part of the 3% counter consensus... Or inversely I could generally have a brain by knowing climate apocalypses are doomsday scenarios yet publish a single pro-apocalypse paper and I would contribute to the 97% consensus. \n\nOh yeah, but I'm just a retard conspiracist, right? It's still 97% consensus of papers right? Not even slightly, remember it was publically challenged and then independently surveyed to show a 1.6% consensus and then as the cherry on top, many of the scientists actively came out and said their paper was blatantly mischaracterised to support the dogma and that is not their stance or the correct interpretation of their paper.\n\n\nSo it's not even \"97% of scientists agree,\" it's \"97% of the specific papers chosen for the survey agree\" fuck me this is just dripping with bias... If I were such a scientist I would just immediately not survey any paper which had a title with even a hint of 'anthropogenic climate change is a myth' and being that the scientific community is very stern about informative and accurate paper titles and abstracts. It would be very simple to select our papers which challenge climate change and simply not survey those at all, whilst specifically selecting for pro-climate change papers to survey, in order to argue the 97% consensus... Nah, what am I on about?! Clearly, that's conspiracy theories, they would never do that even though they've been caught out doing that extensively before.\n\nHere's an article which discusses the Cook nonsense. You could easily Google what I say to fact check it true or false but I know pseudo-intellectual spastics like you base your entire opinion around what other people tell you the experts say and what poorly written non-scientific articles can be linked to push that idea - it's written by Forbes, I'm not necessarily for or against them, but I Googled the exact thing I told you and would expect any thinking person to Google themselves and this happened to be an article which talked about the Cook fabrication towards the end. \n\nHappy reading... I'm just kidding of course, I know you're not going to read it - people like you don't read. \n\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/#5d01b2243f9f\n\nNow, I and I'd expect any other rational or logical person would consider this an absolute nail in the coffin for climate myths... But I know unthinking retards such as yourself don't function on wavelengths of rationality. Did you know that you can Google scientists that challenge climate change? I even stumbled upon a Wikipedia article at some point which lists a number of climate sceptical scientists... Why are most of the scientists who challenge climate change meteorologists and climatologists specifically? Why aren't they professors of fucking dance therapy? Or fucking brain surgeons? It's almost as though the consensus among those who challenge climate change is almost exclusively from the field of experts which you would specifically entrust to have such an opinion on these matters.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jordan Huckel", "channel": "UCMeZYWI2mrim4c_y34wMG4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSM87VVr57EtNqlfI42XimeYHUFnXvHA_rWBnzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxI7kX7gyD77mLbHm14AaABAg.8uXG0sPkjdw8uvtfLpIyEY", "text": "​ @Zoë Collins  \n\n\"hey there, you seem to rlly know your stuff. I do believe in climate change but I have read some of your comments and they seem to be really informed.\"\n\nThank you, that's really kind and respectful.\n\n\"I'm interested to know more about your sources.\"\n\nI don't mean this as a point of condescension, at least to you anyway, but I'm using the exact same sources as everyone else, I'm just actually reading them rather than listening to disproven myths such as the 97% scientific consensus in support of climate change. Where some people are opting to simply bully and degrade someone who is sceptical of anything - how very counter scientific may I add, to discourage scepticism and individual thought - I have instead opted to say \"fuck it, I don't care if I'm ridiculed or bullied, I'm following facts no matter what.\" Be assured, I've been ridiculed and bullied a lot - happens when you follow data and science rather than caving into the hive-mind. \n\nFun fact, I even believed in the flat Earth thing for a day. Got really drawn in, read all the theories... Then I read the counter-arguments, the counter theories, I read up on how we prove the Earth is round and how we prove that the data is presenting a spherical Earth rather than a flat Earth, even though the data may suggest an immediate bias... To simplify - it looks flat, so how do we know it's actually round? Well, we do because we can determine that empirical data actually presents a 'globe model' if you will, rather than a flat one. If you want to delve into the abstract, one could argue that there has not yet been any concrete scientific proof to present the spherical nature of the Earth and similar to how gravity is still technically a theorem which is simply constantly reaffirmed with experimentation (what goes up must come down) and calculation, the spherical nature of our planet is also just an oddity of Occam's razor. Given the nuance of the data, we technically could have a flat Earth with perhaps a miniature sun and moon rotating above us which is built and controlled by aliens or the lizard people, but the likelihood is far greater than a rotating mass of cosmic dust and rock drawn together due to their collective gravitational pull from their mass created a spherical object in space, specifically spherical in shape due to the rotating nature of the cosmic mass and the feature of constant radius in a circle or sphere. \n\n... Or, it could be flat, but things would be a lot simpler and more easily explained if it were a sphere. \n\nWell, in actuality there is a lot of science from other fields, which reaffirm a globe model, such as refraction of light and energy waves through the atmosphere (a topic which also interestingly adds evidence against climate change) but specifically within the realm or reading by a regular person, it's able to be concluded that the Earth is most probably a sphere due to the fact that although it could technically be flat, due to some of the data observed, it's astronomically unlikely. \n\nWell, there's an element of life-story no one asked for, but it serves a purpose. We all agree gravity exists, we all agree the Earth is round. Why? Are we doing so because we've looked into it ourselves and considered the arguments of both sides to arrive at a correct conclusion? Or have we trusted that someone else reliable has done that for us and has simply given us the correct answer, to which we can believe as gospel without the slightest amount of scepticism? Personally, I've looked into it... You can always learn more, but I'm confident that I have come to the conclusions I have not because I was told what to think, but because I questioned it myself and arrived at the answer. I'd assume that most people believe in those two things as well as many other things purely because we're raised that way, we're taught to believe it's fact with 100% consensus and there's no point questioning it because we're wasting time.\n\nSo this brings about a decent segway - if I don't believe in climate change because I have looked into the data and read the arguments and counter-arguments... Then why do I think others believe in climate change? Blatantly, due to the 97% consensus myth and due to our bullying authoritarian culture. I think it's quite hilarious, science is supposed to be a field where you're always supposed to be sceptical, you're always supposed to think independently and question... Yet, with some things, climate change being a major player, you are strongly ridiculed the moment you question anything. It's one of the few fields of science where you're supposed to obey authority mindlessly... Though really this doesn't come from bonafide scientists so much as it comes from the general public... Specifically, 'The left.' That elusive beast, the group who says they're intolerant, scientifically superior and enlightened- they're the one's ridiculing and bullying anyone who follows the scientific method and thinks for themselves.\n\n\nSorry, can't resist a jab at the left, especially when it's about showing their authoritarian hypocrisy. \n\nThere's a great quote which slides in here well, I'm not sure from who it's by, but it goes something like this - When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.\n\n\nI think most of the general public believing in climate change comes from one place... Supposedly, there's a 97% consensus among scientists to support climate change. I'm not going to waste space reiterating an argument again because I'm sure you'll read it in my reply to that other person out of interest, but I'll summarise and link to a Forbes article which addresses it. Essentially, the stat comes from a paper published by John Cook in 2013, who runs a website caused sceptical science... Ironically, as a side note, his website was largely a place of education for me when I was younger, about 5 years ago, when I thought I was the enlightened eco-warrior fighting climate change conspiracists that were all obviously paid off by big oil to destroy the planet with CO2.\n\n\nHis paper concluded that 97% of the papers he surveyed were in support of his climate change hypothesis. Before I even mention the immense conflict of interest and potential for bias, I think it's important to note that it was publically challenged and that when independently assessed, an outside observer found only 1.6% of those papers were in support of the thesis. There are more points to make but I think the blatant lie is enough - combined with the fact that you can Google climate denying scientists, I remember stumbling upon a Wikipedia page some time ago, some kind of a name and shame. I think it's ironic, you'd think all the scientists who are sceptical of climate theory are like, professors or dance therapy, or brain surgeons, or some other nonsense field which has nothing to do with climate. They're almost all meteorologists or climatologists. \n\nI think that's the best and most concise counter-argument I could make. It would be a waste of time to suggest I have a silver bullet article which proves climate change BS, because the vast majority aren't believing in climate change because the science proves it, they're doing so because those who don't are publically ridiculed and the public is constantly having it drilled into them, by the media and politicians obviously, that there's a 97% consensus of scientists and anyone who doesn't fall in line is a lunatic and a conspiracy theorist. \n\nI mean, look at all the replies to me or which mention me, they're quite hurtful... Well, I mean, they're not hurtful as in I give a single fuck what illiterate idiots in a YouTube comments section think or say about me, but they're quite clearly intended to be as hurtful as can be and they have strong like ratios on them.\n\n\nDon't have kids\n\n\nDumbest comment yet\n\n\nYou're whats wrong with humanity\n\n\nPeople likey you are holding back the world\n\n\nJesus Christ are you insane?\n\n\n... That kind of shit. It's clearly not written by intellectuals, it's clearly not intellectuals going around giving these people 20+ or 30+ likes on comments which are essentially \"people who disagree with this are fucking idiots and people shouldn't think independently.\" This is textbook hive mind bullshit, ridicule anyone who challenges the status quo idea and try to say as hurtful things as you can think of. \n\n\nLuckily none of these people are actually intellectuals or they'd say something that would actually be upsetting like 'well if that's the way you think then clearly the public education system is a complete failure and you're going to spend the rest of your life working so that billions of tax dollars can be wasted to fail to teach hundreds of thousands of retards like you.\" That would be hurtful, that would really hit home that I'm stuck in a broken system that I can't possibly change which I'm forced to support my whole life. I mean, if I were wrong, 'the public education system failed with you' would be an incredibly hurtful and witty argument, but besides that point completely, it's quite hard-hitting to remind me I'm stuck supporting a failing education system my whole life.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jordan Huckel", "channel": "UCMeZYWI2mrim4c_y34wMG4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSM87VVr57EtNqlfI42XimeYHUFnXvHA_rWBnzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I actually had my phone in hand the second you replied to me two days ago, I was so drawn by the kindness of your response that I started typing immediately on my phone hoping I could at least put a decent thank you reply out straight away which I could edit when I got home to include some data to support my ideas but I accidentally deleted the entire thing so now I'm kind of bullshitting my way through it and trying to write something fair and decent because I think something so kind and succinct actually deserves a thought out reply. \n\n\nSo yeah, ironically, the best argument I have against climate change, at least on the basis of being concise, is to dispute the 'scientific consensus.' I can tell straight up that a person like you is more drawn to facts so this is a letdown, but for most others, if they are drawn by emotion and bullying via authority (which they are) then they won't be convinced by facts, they'll only be convinced by emotion - ergo a counter-argument of facts is a waste of time, what is needed is a counter argument of authority.\n\n\nHere's that Forbes article which addresses the 97% consensus idea.\n\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/#5d01b2243f9f\n\n\nJust between you and I, I have a feeling that you wouldn't be convinced by 'most scientists think climate change is BS'\nlike most people here would. I personally have a hunch you would be more convinced by data, but unfortunately there isn't a whole lot of 'anti-climate change' data per se, because most of the 'climate change isn't real' science is just disproving faulty claims or calling out bad experiments/ papers.\n\n\nFor example, someone linked to me, in a reply, a source which they claim proves climate change... I guess more specifically, they are asserting it proves anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change.\n\n\nhttp://peabody.yale.edu/sites/default/files/documents/education/Global%20Warming%20In%20A%20Jar.pdf\n\n\nThis experiment is called \"global warming in a jar.\" This obviously an experiment aimed at children and it isn't bad per se as it does teach kids about the greenhouse effect. The problem with it is that it doesn't prove global warming... It's an experiment that proves atmospheres exists and that they serve a purpose. It even sets this out in the beginning of the PDF document. Then at the end, of course, it has a teachers section where they are supposed to take the real and true science taught by the model and educate children on 'global warming' and its impacts. \n\n\nI may or may not have opinions for or against this and I may have interpretations analogous to indoctrination had it been a topic which was not widely accepted being discussed off tangent and educated from authority rather than data and experimentation. In English: Does this experiment in any way demonstrate or prove global warming? No, not in the slightest, it simply proves the greenhouse effect - the greenhouse effect is a fact of planetary atmospheres and it exists whether or not global warming does. Suffice to say, this is obvious but the Earths atmosphere existed before humans did and before supposed climate change, they're not intertwined. \n\n\nThis is what I mean when I say most anti-global warming science isn't conducting experiments which disprove global warming per se, but instead calling out poor interpretations of data or poor experimentation. So, if this experiment which concisely proves that atmospheres exist and demonstrates what they do isn't proof of global warming, then what would be? \n\n\nWell, maybe if you fill the jar with 100% CO2 and then conduct the experiment again and see even a single degree of difference then that would be a nail in the coffin experiment? After all, the specific hypothesis of global warming doctrine is that anthropogenic CO2 emissions, causing a rise in CO2 concentration, leads to a warming of the Earth due to the increased amount of greenhouse gasses. Surely if you wanted to PROVE the premise of climate change without a doubt, you could just conduct the experiment using the closed jar as the control and fill a few others with 100% greenhouse gas, CO2 in one, methane in another, some fancy fluorocarbon most people in this comment section couldn't even pronounce in another and SURELY with such a simple experiment you could prove UNDENIABLY that an increase in greenhouse gas concentration leads to an increase in temperature...\n\n\nI haven't seen it yet, but I'm open to someone showing me that experiments results or conducting it themselves. That's what I'm talking about, most of this comment section doesn't have a fucking clue what they're on about. I bet $10 that this little cunt just Googled \"experiment that proves global warming\", or something similar and found it in the first 3 results of their search.\n\n\nI'm just kidding, there have already been experiments which prove that a vessel under a light which contains a 100% CO2 atmosphere warms faster than a vessel of regular atmosphere... My point isn't to prove that greenhouse gasses are indeed not greenhouse gasses, because if they weren't, then there would be no greenhouse effect... My point is to simply show the alarming scientific illiteracy of the people challenging my ideas and stance. Just to reiterate - the specific person in question rather than linking an experiment which proves CO2 to be a greenhouse gas, simply links a greenhouse experiment which proves atmosphere and asserts it to be a proof of global warming.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jordan Huckel", "channel": "UCMeZYWI2mrim4c_y34wMG4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSM87VVr57EtNqlfI42XimeYHUFnXvHA_rWBnzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I don’t want to go full conspiracy and suggest that schools are basically indoctrination camps that exist only to mould children into the humans required to exist in the society we’ve created rather than being the intelligent and questioning individuals we’d like to think schools create.\n\nIn fact, if you even accept that Gods do not exist, then it is blatantly obvious that some schools exist which indoctrinate children with untruths... And if you think Gods do exist, then it can only be true that most schools indeed indoctrinate untruths by teaching falsehoods.\n\nIt’s not a nice reality but schools exist solely to teach what the given society wants to teach kids. We wish that were intellect, scientific method, acceptance and individual thought.\n\nWhether any individual agrees with me or not, it’s blatantly obvious that schools do not teach these values or that they’ve blatantly fucking failed to do so because the overwhelming response to me here is ridicule, poor attempts and bullying and hurtful language and basic hive mind nonsense - not by a long shot is it acceptance, critical thought or respect for scientific method... So there’s that.\n\nWhy would they teach it if it’s nonsense. Do you realise energy is the base resource in this world? This gets deeper than any conspiracy because it’s actually true, there are conspiracies about those who control money controlling the world, the Rothschilds or whatever, there’s conspiracies about government... It’s all nonsense, energy is the baseline. Energy is the baseline for industry, energy is the baseline for domestic production and energy is the baseline for resources.\n\nWe may be fooled into thinking that the baseline is our ability to obtain resources...

Convincing people’s eco conscious that we MUST tax the fuck out of energy in order to save the planet? Congratulations, you’ve got humanity by the balls.\n\nAnd I don’t really give a fuck about the existence of climate change propaganda and lying politicians getting massive tax revenue from it to be perfectly honest... I’m pissed off because actual solutions such as supercritical CO2 and current gen nuclear are pushed to the back burner so we can waste fucking resources in regressive 100% renewables nonsense.\n\nThat’s it’s own argument too but it’s fucking tragic - rather than making progress, we’re wasting time and funding on this BS and the scientists who play along do so because it means more grant money to study climate change.

I completely understand what you're saying as far as these faulty experiments and I agree that there are plenty of people who will try to attribute unrelated data to climate change. I recently had someone tell me that the recent wildfires were caused entirely by the rising climate, which is extremely false. it seems to me that a lot of people are willing to fight for climate change and the environment without putting any research into that passion. this excites me in that people are eager to protect the environment but also scares me because these are the people who are representing the climate change cause. \n\n\nI don't claim to be a climatologist in any way--I'm just a high schooler with too many books, a vigorous curiosity, and the infinite expanse of the internet. however, there were just a few things that I have read about recently that might (maybe?) cause you to rethink your stance. the first is a case study of the golden toad, previously found in costa rica. the golden toad went extinct because the pools they reproduced in evaporated as the cloud cover thinned. scientists first thought this could just be climate patterns (el nino and el nina) but it was quickly attributed to climate change because of the long-term study of weather patterns. I mean, the climate had changed so drastically that in a matter of a few years the population thinned to 0. I'm a die-hard herpetologist so I can go on about frog extinctions forever but this was just one example of species extinction that really devastated an ecosystem. this was really just from memory and I'd absolutely recommend googling some articles on the golden toad and climate change. riveting stuff. \n\n\nanother case study many don't consider is the thawing permafrost layers. the frozen ground in places like alaska are thawing, causing homes and plots of land to sink. climatologists are attributing this to climate change and it is absolutely fascinating. I've tried to explain it a ton of times here in the comments but I butcher it every time, so I'll just link an article below\nhttps://insideclimatenews.org/news/16012019/permafrost-thaw-climate-change-temperature-data-arctic-antarctica-mountains-study\n\n\nas for the Forbes article, I am still not completely convinced. the article says that  \"the specific meaning of the 97% claim is: 97 percent of climate scientists agree that there is a global warming trend and that human beings are the main cause--that is, that we are over 50% responsible.\" while this article is perfect for the dimwit climate activists who have no idea what they're talking about, I don't think it proves your claim that most scientists think climate change is BS, unless I misunderstood you. \n\n\nsome of this may sound very familiar to you since you were once a climate change activist and I apologize for any repetition. however, thank you for entertaining my curiosity and I'm excited to hear from you soon.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Zoë Collins", "channel": "UCYO97BS0VDEJZp5FKxk0oMA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQk_f1FxU2iVYyNcTWp6kFSjrptJtzDibf1zZOalQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

At least I'd hope.\n\n\nWhilst I strongly strongly argue against CO2 driven global warming/sea level rise, there are absolutely other environmental issues which do exist and are important such as pollution, eutrophication, deforestation, habitat destruction, overfishing or whatever else, so if a belief in climate change indirectly leads one to act in ways that benefit these other things, then that's a net positive. \n\n\nThe downside really comes when you see people acting as is the majority of those who have replied to me by forcing unscientific values such as trying to bully people into compliance and suggesting that people should merely digest what is force-fed to them rather than thinking for themselves and becoming smarter every day. \n\n\nNothing wrong with being pro-climate change, so long as you stay scientific, keep thinking critically and think for yourself. Just never stop reading and never stop asking questions. Maybe one day you'll stumble upon a string of information as I and a number of others have which leads you to question and consequently eventually reject climate change and maybe you won't, but it really doesn't matter anyway because you'll do far more good in the world by thinking critically and encouraging independent thought and research with others whilst believing in something that I don't personally think exists (along with others of course) than you would simply converting your opinion on climate change to the same as mine overnight because you assume that I know what I'm talking about. Not that I'm suggesting you would, merely that most people feel climate change is factual because they've been told to believe it by sources they believe to be credible or which bully people who are sceptical.\n\n\nThanks again for the respectful reply, you and a couple of others like Zoe give me hope that there are still intelligent, critical thinking people in the world - even if they don't agree with me on all things.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Jordan Huckel", "channel": "UCMeZYWI2mrim4c_y34wMG4g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSM87VVr57EtNqlfI42XimeYHUFnXvHA_rWBnzA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It will really cement your views on this matter. Please please please, for the sake of our planet and for the sake of the animals, STOP eating meat. And not just meat. Dairy, eggs, and fish have just as much of an impact, if not more so! Go vegan, it’s probably the biggest impact you can have on the world! 🌎\n\nAlso, for anyone who doesn’t understand why animal agriculture is so detrimental, it’s because of all the plants and grain we feed to them. The energy conversion ratio from plants to animal to human is so poor its almost stupid. No, it IS stupid. Feeding a cow many many pounds of grain and then to get just one pound of beef to eat is so incredibly wasteful. Did you know that we could end world hunger if we just redirected the plants we feed to animals, to people instead? I’m not even mentioning other problems such as runoff, methane emission, water use, clear cutting of the Amazon Rainforest for cattle to graze, the extreme overfishing of our oceans (also the bycatch of dolphins, sharks, and sea turtles), all for a meal that lasts 15 minutes, when there are abundant plant based alternatives that taste just as delicious.\n\nWake up people!! It’s time to change your habits; it’s time to do what’s RIGHT, not what serves your own self interests. That may sound harsh, but I think it’s about time that people need to hear it; it’s not just a “personal choice” when it affects others - not just animals either (though animals suffer absolutely horrible lives in this industry, I’m kind of skipping over that part of veganism just because this is a environmental video, but i’m not trying to downplay that aspect at all, because to be truly honest, loving animals is what actually led me to veganism, but the environmental reasons are super compelling as well).\n\nSorry for this long rant :)", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Abby Wambach", "channel": "UCcNkudhBSb-4BRZDOGs-BVQ", "votes": "15", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShkqBOHL6ytypCEA6UWNG5kiYmXJCCj7J3wA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The average person eats 7,000 animals in their lifetime. Most people have very little understanding of how taxing animal livestock farming is on resources. The other problem is, there are too many people on earth to feed people with sustainable means of meat without a massive reduction in meat consumption. You’re better off going vegan and tipping the scales to zero on one end for the 7,000 someone else will eat. I hope that gives some perspective of why it’s important to take veganism serious. It needs to become popularized if the ratio of meat eaters to resources will balance. The other side is yes, we need to eat more plant based as it does not take up nearly the fraction of land that livestock does. Also define your means of sustainably raised meat. It’s important to factor in animal welfare and the consciousness of sentient beings. If we can’t provide the necessary resources to sustain a healthy and happy lifestyle for animals. Then we have to stop to consider, do our tastebuds have more value when alternatives and nutrition are on par if not greater than those who eat meat.

How many is that per person Per lifetime? 100 animals? And how many animals die during the lifetime of a single person eating a vegan diet.  I spent years and years considering and even trying veganisim. It simply won’t work in the mainstream because not everyone is a masochist who enjoys feeling tired and weak, sick and sad all the time. The vegans who have survived long term on a vegan diet do just that ;survive.  We as humans have fought tooth and nail to survive, and now we want to live.   This isn’t about taste pleasure. This is about health. I don’t eat for taste, if I did I would eat sugar and candy.    Let’s face it. Driving and urbanization is way worse for the environment than cows.

I hope that helps clarify. \n\nI’m sorry you were frustrated with eating vegan, you do have to be mindful of your dietary intake when making a big diet change from meat based to plant based. Personally, I am vegan and I’m the healthiest I’ve been, but I do very much care about my health and am conscious of what my diet entails in order to feel optimal. I do enjoy cooking, so I’m sure this helps. I also don’t know what part of the country you live in, but there’s lots of major cities out there with access to proper balanced vegan meals when eating out and the internet is a great resource in how to get all your nutrients and feel great. It does take an investment in time and energy to learn new diets, so I do see how this is difficult for some. \n\nMy new roots is an awesome website for lots of vegan options or minimalist baker if you want to find more balanced meals in getting proper nutrients. I could break down the health statistics of why dairy is problematic for your health, but I think that’s another topic. I would also recommend pescatarian diet if veganism is too difficult for you. But when pointing to health statistics, you’re way off on veganism being bad for your health. It’s quite the opposite considering how much attention goes into nutrients when most meat eaters put in very little time. Of course you can’t eat fried food all day as a vegan; you have to put in the work. \n\nI would also suggest looking up statistics on livestock farming as cow farming is the leading cause of methane emissions. I also would look up water usage statistics and fertilizer and feed statistics. I’m not trying to be rude, I just think you haven’t done your research and it would be better for everyone (literally everyone) if you would start.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "J Baldwin", "channel": "UCefEIcRPkaAYY1Q5ej6gJjQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR1q2H4AG6sGLOdVvLqP6braf_XyWfzKFgXga-LDQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Propaganda like what the health claims its 51%, but later retracted that claim.  \n\nAlso I will never be vegan.  If the world became vegan and meat somehow became so illegal I couldn't even hunt rats I would voluntarily starve to death.  The movement is well intended but ultimately as horrible as Hitlers final solution. \n\n\nPlants simply are not a good source of food.  Plants are naturally toxic as a way of self defense.  The only reason some animals can eat mostly plants is because they have evolved complex digestive systems to overcome plant defenses over millions of years.\n\n85% of vegans quit. Not because they suddenly stop caring or hate animals, but because they are SUFFERING.  Unfortunately by promoting your starvation diet to others you are promoting suffering.\n\nI don't understand why you think pescatarianisim is superior to cattle farming.  Properly managed cattle grazing actually benefits the environment.   Think about it; we have been eating LESS beef over the last 30 years and the environment has been getting worse since then.  Fish farming is fine if done correctly, but the key word is correctly.  So far the only way I would get farmed salmon would be is if it was from British Columbia.  \n\n\nWild caught is fine too as long as you are carefully following a sustainable fishing guide.\n\n\nGrass finished beef is actually about as good as it gets when it comes to food (plant or animal).  Chicken is okay but I don't get it too often since I don't agree with modern chicken farming practices.  The organic free range birds end up way easier to carve and have better tasting fat when they live longer and actually go outside and forage.  Of course when I raise and slaughter my own birds that will be the best.\n\n\nI don't eat for taste.  I eat for health.  I probably know more about where my food comes from than you do.

EVERY person would have to stop polluting and littering, and start cleaning up others messes. We'd have to stop taking away all the wilderness. Stop hunting endangered animals. Stop using plastics. Stop spraying the world with chemicals. Stop using heavy warfare and explosives. The list goes on. This would have to be all done together as a whole. Fact is, it won't happen. We're continuing to drive ourselves deeper into total extinction. Why does Elon Musk want to inhabit Mars so badly? Why does he want to replace gas and diesel vehicles with electric? Why does he want others to be inspired and take on his goals as well? He knows we're all done. Maybe there will be a chance if all that happened, and we lose about 3-5 billion people.

Fire the British Royal Family (sorry, WWF, I know Prince Charles is one of yours; but they'll be fine they own most continents and their resources and trading companies in the world anyway which goes in the queen's deeeeeeeeep pockets); remove the Federal Reserve; remove the wealthiest families from meddling in our political agendas to boost their own sales. Starting with that alone will end wars (because wars destroy the planet HELLO!). Instead, give power of change to marine biologists; scientists; political scientists; economists; philosophers; and kind humanitarian workers.. that should get it going in the right direction because they WILL enforce regulations whether people are into it or not. The burden of destroying our planet shouldn't be put on us alone by telling us \"hey stop eating meat and don't toss your bottle in the ocean, you naughty naughty boy!\". We can't control product packaging as much as we'd like to, we can't all stop eating meat (I already have and I still have to transport other goods from the grocery store to my home) we can't all worry about living our lives, plan our future, afford raising our kids, having 4 hours to live after work to do all that and also avoid buying what we need to live. It's always dumped on us small consumers while the people at the top enforce their own products on our lifestyle and the planet and THEY make no sacrifices. THEIR endeavors are what's causing the planet to rot. Honestly this was just a waste of time. What we need is regulation on packaging, new environmental laws, and a huge awareness campaign in schools and in all industries (fashion, food, fossil fuels...) so that future business owners know what to do. You can't just say \"don't buy this product you need\" like seriously? I need to buy shit sometimes okay there's rarely a choice on our end 90% of the time, let alone an affordable one. We need to start our governments over; they have been infiltrated by all the gredy people that are preventing all that change from happening because they  profit from how things are and keeping them that way. This isn't the right message guys. There is SO MUCH MORE to do than just not eat meat, not eat fish, and not buy this or that. If solutions were currency, what you offer here is pennies. It's like when they told us to fix the CO2 in the air we had to buy special lightbulbs. What change has that made, huh? No guys..

It may help you more to understand the use of soy and oil as it is use by the majority (98% of the world) rather than wasting your efforts on a minority (less than 1-2%).  Soy and oils are in just about every product on the shelves but even that is less than the amount of soy that we grow to feed farm animals. Around 70 percent of the world's soy is fed directly to livestock and only six percent of soy is turned into human food.  If you are worried about soy production I urge you to consider how much land and resource goes into feed the billions of animals that are bred and raised for slaughter. As with palm oil, the unsustainable practices absolutely need to stop and you will find vegans at the forefront of those conversations.  Many vegans eat a completely whole food - plant based diet which omits oils all together.

It's all thanks to desalination plants for water, not taxing on the environment one bit.

Use those to control all the gases in our atmosphere, always keeping it optimal. All the while controlling our population. And technology will only get better. We'll have devices that can control seismic activity. Then we'll completely control our earth.

So if you look at “planet”, how are you defining this particular planet, so let’s say “earth”. To define Earth, let’s talk about its composition and characteristics in order to define it. If you wanted to say yes, the planet will be fine then you would say sure, rock formation will still exist and some life forms embedded in the earth. Sure things will create their own order out of displacement, but all those defining characteristics of Earth, will no longer make Earth as Earth. This incredibly unique and diverse range of ecological systems. So yeah, we could say the rock formation of this earth will still exist, but maybe not even. You have to look at the atmosphere that’s protecting meteors from creating mass energy strikes. If our atmosphere breaks down, there’s even a chance the whole rock formation won’t exist. Things are way more complicated than just humans living here. Plus why would you not want to be active in preserving this absolutely incredible, jaw droppingly beautiful planet that exists right now.

Travel less by enjoying the moments you have each day with mindfulness. Walk, ride a bike or take transit over driving.

Advocate to your local electives that you desire funding to go to more alternative energy options and when buying a home, invest in renewable energy sources. Donate and volunteer for environmental protection agencies. You can sign petitions on NGO websites. Again advocate to your electors the importance of wildlife preservation. Talk with your friends and family about this topic. Bring it up in school. Share this video on your social media platforms.

{"cid": "UgzGvxqNSsH_JWe4HkJ4AaABAg", "text": "The dying Earth should be of grave concern to all: Its why over 15,000 real scientists have signed off on plant-based diets being the best way to save the planet, clearing forests to plant animal feed is unsustainable: Ethical veganism as a minimum moral baseline as part of a wider moral universalism is the way forward, until we find an even better moral benchmark. Most people realise that murdering 74 BILLION sentient beings, each and every year, is immoral as well as unsustainable. \n\nAll current media formats are now, finally, replete with reportage on the most efficient land use for an Earth, over-populated by what is fast-approaching nine billion humans. The solution is VEGANISM and the phasing out of animal agriculture, if limited soil resources and land area are to keep pace at all. How many science deniers at WWF and Extinction Rebellion are still non-vegan I wonder? Meanwhile look at the malignant political blubber-necks in the WhiteHouse: they wear their triple-chins, over-spilling their shirt collars like a badge of self-indulgent shame.\n\nThe Earth was never meant for one single species: deforestation to plant crops to feed to animals is incredibly inefficient and immoral.  Over 50% of all animals have gone since 1970. Gone forever due to loss of habitat caused by human over-population. And that's only the species we have identified: there are animals and plants which are going extinct without ever having been known to humankind. And yet this 'super apex' species of upright apes will not share.\n\nIn the past it has been difficult to argue with omni-stupid CARNIST ignorance, however, for those that believe that it is their choice to eat what they want, that is wrong, plain and simple: Because the animals don't get a choice: they have an inalienable right to live, just as much as you do. As a human animal you are the result of 13.8 billion years of cosmic evolution and you should have evolved empathy and compassion by now. And it is neolithic thinking to claim that you are justified in killing non-human animals because of paleobarbaric traditions: in other words, as a violent, bloodthirsty extremist, (no doubt citing canine teeth as an excuse, N.B, please research [herbivores] gorilla teeth) you are addicted to the taste of the dead flesh of corpses murdered en masse. \n\nThe violent ideology of THERIOCIDE behind the slaughterhouse death cult is actually capital punishment for the innocent, in a silent holocaust of perpetual genocide: All that suffering purely for the sake of your taste buds, in spite of all the vegan alternatives.\n\nWhat you think you know is part of the carnist propaganda machine of those invested in intensive animal farming and torture, particularly dairy cruelty, literally fed to you since before you could choose your own food and feed yourself. If you see yourself as an animal lover, custodian of a dog or a cat, look up SPECIESISM. Others need to do some research on SENTIENCE, on the limbic system and the pre-mammalian brain: you'll begin to understand that all these creatures feel joy, fear, terror and pain without exception. You start to realise that a shift of consciousness is required to undo the years of brainwashing by the violent ideology of the current self-dealing dominion of carnism (run by the same 1% that takes your money and uses it for surveillance capitalism, super-yachts, luxury nuclear bunkers and endless wars, instead of universities and health care). \n\nVegans speak for those that have no voice, the animals enslaved and tortured from birth, not for ourselves. To argue against veganism is to argue in favour of the right to inflict continued suffering and animal cruelty; those are the actions of a malicious violent bully. Just remember that if that's your position, you have a higher chance of dying from a cardiac, stroke, obesity and any number of cancers, but bowel cancer in particular and, maybe that's exactly what you'll reap. Or you can try ethical veganism instead and respect all sentient beings: the life you save may even be your own. \n\n It has to be a vegan future; YOUR SURVIVAL depends on MORAL RE-ORIENTATION.\n\nVegans are waiting for you to EVOLVE.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Zanzibar979", "channel": "UCgTFohwjSW-vjFZDGBaPFrA", "votes": "47", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ3WlsYoXbnVqI_RodxM0ViA0czErFBKUZzxw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We all just keep doing what we have always been doing with hardly any change even though shit is getting worse.\nHumanity will not evolve under this monetary system, we are going backwards, and no one seems to see this.\nThey are using racism to divide the people, pitting blacks and whites, the Left vs Right, all of us against each other, and even, against our own. Think about the tactics they use, we see, hear, and feel all this racism, feminism, multiculturalism, etc. They don't even need obedient workers anymore they now can automate and use robots. Sowing the seeds now so when they cut the jobs off the money off, the food off - we will destroy each other while they sit back drinking mimosa.\n\n\nThe only way we can make things better is to do away with this monetary system. We have the ability and the technology to make this planet an amazing place, where peace, love, and freedom could rule the land, yet we choose to live this way. We have the technology to make anything run cleaner, last longer, and have no cost. Tesla made free energy that was destroyed by J.P Morgan because with “Free stuff”, one cannot enslave the masses. I do not care what you believe in, I am telling you, both the left-wing and the right-wing belong to the same bird. The monetary system is/has taken over this planet and we continue to work for them because we are enslaved. Our natural resources are diminishing. Meanwhile, our population is exponentially increasing. Any and all scientist agree the resources are running out. NASA says it will happen within just a couple decades.\n\nPlease take 4 minutes to watch these two links, they might enlighten you. The people need to wake up, we have a lot of work to do if we are going to save ourselves and this planet.\n\n\n140 seconds - https://youtu.be/uRwIlsMsqW4\n\n\n90 seconds How they get us to war - https://youtu.be/v5YJIkvwYiU\n\n“DOGMA” is the nuclear weapon they (the elites) have been using and will continue to use, unless we change.\n\nWe have the ability and the technology to make this planet an amazing place, where peace, love, and freedom could rule the land, yet we choose to live this way.

I do believe this is why we see the agendas being pushed today.\n\nDid you know President George W. Bush bought 298,840 acres of land in Paraguay? Bush did not buy this land for any other reason besides the fact that it sits on top of the biggest aquifer on planet earth. Aquifer Guarani covers roughly 460,000 square miles under parts of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. What do you think this world will look like when water is the new GOLD? What do you want for your children? For this planet? The Animals? The universe? Humanity does not have to be this horible plauge that destroys everything it touches, but we are choosing to be everyday we do nothing to fix it.\n\nGeorge Carlin said, \"The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They've long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying. Lobbying, to get what they want.\n\nWell, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interests.\"\n\nHe is right, they do not want people uniting, so they make all the ISMS to divide us. \"Racism\", \"Multiculturalism\", \"Feminism\", etc.etc.\nThey have done a damn good job. We need forward thinking, logical, hardworking people to overcome, and everyone has lost hope.\n\nThis planet needs a whole new system. https://youtu.be/KphWsnhZ4Ag The Choice is Ours. The people need to remove political agendas along with having the open-mindedness and willingness to overcome. I know this would take many many moons to achieve but a change is already on its way, and so far its looking like whites are going to be the blame for everything throughout history, and this is why we are watching white genocide take place all over the world today, and no one is saying anything about it. Only the winners write history and we are losing this war so far. We have some huge decisions to make. Do we want to RULE this planet, rid this country of all other races, and bully the world taking all the power we can, or do we want peace, and trust that \"all men are created equal\"?\nNo men are created equal under this monetary system. It breeds division and gives birth to classes.\n\n\"The Venus Project\" has the blueprints we need in order to achieve it all. It is obvious humanity cannot take care of ourselves and everything else at once so we need A.I. to do it for us. You do not have to do it by yourself.

If the average temperature rises by 1°C each century  the temperature will increase by roughly 10°C worldwide. This isn't even accounting for the fact that medical technology will inevitably improve, people will keep living longer and longer, countries are developing and will have the same technology that we have today. Assuming our care for the environment doesn't increase (which I hope it will), the rate of fossil feul emmissions wil increase exponentially. And care and support for LDCs is increasing faster than ever before due to the news and media and our technology. Now, 1°C perc century doesn't sound like much but this will increase exponentially if we don't change our ways. In 1000 years this will be at least 10°C. That will mean no more snowy winters except for the very top of the arctic circle. The summer's in Brazil and The UAE got you cooking at 50°C? Oh, those will be at least 60°C and up. The wildlife will have to adapt or die out, and this won't stop considering we cut down more trees than trees that grow every year on the planet. So, the, unless we really change, and get everyone to stop being ignorant little sh$ts this won't change.

I do believe this is why we see the agendas being pushed today.\n\nDid you know President George W. Bush bought 298,840 acres of land in Paraguay? Bush did not buy this land for any other reason besides the fact that it sits on top of the biggest aquifer on planet earth. Aquifer Guarani covers roughly 460,000 square miles under parts of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. What do you think this world will look like when water is the new GOLD? What do you want for your children? For this planet? The Animals? The universe? Humanity does not have to be this horible plauge that destroys everything it touches, but we are choosing to be everyday we do nothing to fix it.\n\nGeorge Carlin said, \"The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They've long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying. Lobbying, to get what they want.\n\nWell, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interests.\"\n\nHe is right, they do not want people uniting, so they make all the ISMS to divide us. \"Racism\", \"Multiculturalism\", \"Feminism\", etc.etc.\nThey have done a damn good job. We need forward thinking, logical, hardworking people to overcome, and everyone has lost hope.\n\nThis planet needs a whole new system. https://youtu.be/KphWsnhZ4Ag The Choice is Ours. The people need to remove political agendas along with having the open-mindedness and willingness to overcome. I know this would take many many moons to achieve but a change is already on its way, and so far its looking like whites are going to be the blame for everything throughout history, and this is why we are watching white genocide take place all over the world today, and no one is saying anything about it. Only the winners write history and we are losing this war so far. We have some huge decisions to make. Do we want to RULE this planet, rid this country of all other races, and bully the world taking all the power we can, or do we want peace, and trust that \"all men are created equal\"?\nNo men are created equal under this monetary system. It breeds division and gives birth to classes. \n\n\"The Venus Project\" has the blueprints we need in order to achieve it all.

Highschool kids were asked \"how can we adapt to climate change\" instead of \"how can we 'solve' it\" and college students voted to get a day off to go protest in the name of the environment. The very people not doing anything more than putting their water bottles in the recycling bin are scolding daddy government for not doing enough for the environment. It's even funnier because the people going to these events are all going into finance, social science and all of the borderline useless programs instead of going into STEM fields and sacrificing their salary to pursue research and maybe find an actual solution to the problems we've created. There was the risk of extinction back in ww1-2 because there was too little nitrogen then poof, Fritz Haber finds a way to make NO2 (and also gased a bunch of people yes). When someone finds ways to clean up half of the CO2, CH3, etc from the atmosphere the protesters will high five each other for solving the great threat that was upon them. In the meantime they'll repost climate change memes, vote for very expensive policies that target companies that actually hire researchers and study in various useless fields.

We see polar bears die and we think no other animal will ever populate the arctic and colder regions but if there are no predators then the prey will just flourish which will bring about more predators after a period of time. \n\n6. Apart from the CO2 there are plenty of toxic waste that is untreated and unfiltered before being released back into the ecosystem and also physical waste such as trash that just seeps into the ecosystem kill and disrupting the wildlife. \n\n7. I would say that it affects us, maybe not the most, but a lot more than it would affect most species. Of course, if there is more water, it means that there is less terrain for land organism but you also have a lot more aquatic based organism that can flourish. Although at the time there is a shit ton of algae that just grows and kills off life by pillaging the oxygen supply. This is mainly due to the amount of NO2 used in agriculture and being washed into water masses. \n\n9. I think that the solution that you propose is based off of the fact that humans are retarded and that we will not change our ways for various personal and \"societal\" reasons. If you did make these companies have to emit 0 toxic waste, assuming only CO2 in this case, most of the work will be done by the consumers because they will have to pay more for the products which is often what happens. I can buy American made products but I could also get a cheaper product from China for less money. This is already happening, you can buy american made products such as Li ion batteries and expect them to be made with much toxic waste but they are also much more expensive than the cheaper Chinese brands because they have a lot less regulation and lower wages. The best way would be to make your solution effective (theres probably way more to this tbh) would be to enforce your policy and also prohibit imports from other countries unless they have passed the standards. These standards must be evaluated by american companies because bribing in China is not uncommon. It isn't uncommon in the US either but at least the corruption would be for the benefit of american companies rather than chinese companies.\n\n10. Coastal cities were built with the idea that trading would be very easy and fish back then was a great way to get food without too much work. They are a bit less useful now but you would still need ports here and there to have a functioning country. I wouldn't be surprised if its more effective to ship 100 000 tons from BC to NB via water and go around south america than it is to go by land with way too many trucks. Given that these trucks also massacre your roads that you have to replace. \n\n11-12. We will have to adapt, I am still amazed that the kids that are barely 3 years younger than me don't realize this yet but hopefully they will soon. I don't think that coastal cities will never be built again but I think people will  be, hopefully, more cautious about them in the near future. Here in MTL we have a lot of flooding in cities near rivers and honestly these people will have to moveout which means that they lose then entire value of their homes without any reparations.
