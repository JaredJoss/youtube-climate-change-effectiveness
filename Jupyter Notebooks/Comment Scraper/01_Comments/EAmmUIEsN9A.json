As a gen Z like you, I fully understand your worries and frighten when thinking about the future of our world - the future where you and I have to live in for the next 50 years - because I always worried about it too. If I was there, I want to give you a hug. I know many people said that the world problems are more complicated and only a speech from an angry girl can't make any impacts. But from the bottom of my heart, I really appreciate your courage to speak up for our generation. You deserve more empathy rather than the criticism. Thanks to your speech, I've taken actions to save our environment by donating 10% of my monthly salary to cultivate trees in the National Parks in Vietnam and I promise to do this from now on to the rest of my life.

Oil isn't running out, it's bio mass fuel so the more Co2 is available, the more bio mass grows, and a portion of that is subsequently re sequestered. People aren't dying younger because of Oil, they're living 30 to 50 years longer because of what oil brings them. The Climate isn't changing because of us, The climate is Changing because it changes and if you think that animals haven't eaten each other out of existence or rivers haven't wiped out habitats or forests haven't burned without us, then you are  very naïve and don't live in the real world. \n\nMore to it, Co2 doesn't even warm the world as proposed, it hits a saturation point very quickly where it stabilises much around the same temperature range the earth has had for eons. Think about how the earth used to have up to 6000PPM and life was booming, that even when it was still over 600PPM, there were giant bird/lizards roaming the lands, note that coconut crabs get bigger every year as more Co2 means more biomass means more oxygen.\n\nOil is a perfectly natural formation of our planet and getting useful energy from it and returning it to the earth's closed loop system is not harmful, it's beneficial. Our best practise is to make sure we burn it as properly as possible so we give out Co2 and Water and much less of things like Co1 or Nox/Sox which cat converters and cleaner modern power plants already handle.\n\nIf you begin regulating a country's Co2 output, then you can throttle their entire economy as Co2 is the only universal outcome of energy consumption, production and industry, the climate scare in effect allows the expert and political class to govern the world as one entity.", "time": "7 months ago", "author": "RhedinRage", "channel": "UCR-keJm97EqvzHAVhYHBU5Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR4W2-Nosowg6vvtg2CM0FPGlZadRSPQOgIYsga=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you observe it’s so obvious that it isn’t being spoken like it is her very own speech. There is barely any passion nor is there any indicator that it comes from her very heart but at the same time I understand it’s probably anxiety inducing to be on a stage in front of many strangers. However, as an autistic person myself with horrible anxiety and someone who has spent years growing up around countless different autistic individuals on all levels on the spectrum I assure you a lot of us would show obvious body language and clear signs that what we are saying comes from within as we are highly sensitive to many things despite the popular misconception that we are emotionless. This is not to say however that some people are not less empathetic or passionate as everyone from each and every group will be different but as a rule we are generally very emotionally sensitive. To add onto my statement about how autistic individuals have obvious body language nonverbal autistic individuals would especially need to use their bodies more so to communicate given the fact that it would be their best way of communicating and it has really helped me offer support to autistic people around me when needed. I hope this is enough of an explanation in supporting the other individuals argument about how Greta’s speech was not her own.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Butterfly", "channel": "UCC9aZo-px8-74W3Ct6ge_aA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRjhAWpJLh8r9xstXBGnRkNVMABGvdfRBGwENkw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The vested interest spend a lot of money, still not to deny climate change directly but to highlight the uncertainty and lapse in our understanding and instances of discontinued participation like the US' exit from the Paris Climate Accord does not promise any more unanimous decisions, accepted universally across the political arena.. this is an area which requires governance on an international level based on ethics as regulatory principles while the institution itself will lead with best practices... in the absence of any meaningful action, we can anticipate nothing more than having to adapt our lifestyles within the harsher climate conditions of the future, whereas if we can mitigate, we can avoid facing significant population displacement, in terms of losing vital habitat, nutritious soil and urbanized coastal zones to the rising sea levels. Bill Gates is writing a book on climate change at the moment and I would wait for it, read it and review my own understanding of the issue because in his experience, he has already spent a lot of money into research and development of fission based nuclear energy or power generation which is much safer for the environment than burning coal which produces a lot of carbon dioxide.. \n\nyou know what they say about extinction, that death is the end of life, but extinction is the end of birth! scary places, we are being led up to... better now than later... good luck! 😐", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Ali Qazilbash", "channel": "UCw4ws0FpUgsuDedridu5XRQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQxCK5bxZI-60uFv9sV7O5leP2AUGwB-D5mgcaxyw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Does oil and coal pollute you bet.  It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up.  Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors.  It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron.  Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid.  More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more.  Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator!  What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off?   4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane?  Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc.  Number one polluter in the world is big agro.  50% of diesel goes into growing are food.  Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate.  We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost.  Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "ballomni", "channel": "UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSu_PGYp6k79oSFOphOwlNS5Wi2I0lOCWhISZo=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The only way for countries to use renewable energy sources is by increasing taxes to much larger amounts so that the countries can fund the installation of numerous wind and solar farms whilst also staying economically stable.

{"cid": "UgyBLPNpbuzwV4Ft6g94AaABAg", "text": "She is actually projecting her fear on us all. She is just a doomsday prophet. Allthough she is correct in that we need to start change now there is no solutions in what she is saying. Its just a dark future that sprung out from her depression some years ago. She had a period with depression and it was introverted making her stop talking and engaging with others. Now she has a extroverted one that forces her to do the oposite. You can tell by looking closely she is kind of forcing herself to do this. Like a robot. She is trapped inside her psychosis and not doing this of her own will. She is autistic with aspergers and in scandinavia they are getting bullied in school. The strike she started is most likely a feeling of wanting to impact the minds of others like others have impacted hers, but only negatively. Bc she has aspergers she will never quite understand the human race and she will never fully understand why she is doing this. She will most surtain fall into a depression when this psychosis loses its grip.  The moment that happens she will disappear and then, within months she will be forgotten. A normal person with no aspergers would never act out like Greta is bc a normal person would after a while have the social skills and self awareness to understand they were only projecting. Its sad to see how many people uncritically follow her lead. Like this Ted talk its more like entertainement. Like a very dark and not funny stand up bit. This is not me going after Greta. This is not me being a climate denier. I believe the science that backs up what she is warning us about. This is just me being tired of people being followers of everyone getting a lot of traction and fame. Greta is just another human being getting her 15 minutes of fame. The difference in Greta and the Kardashians are not that big. They are just on each side of the fame bubble. The difference is that Greta will soon be forgotten while most of the people in the audience in this video will not change their lives like Greta wants them to. People today are too comfortable to being able to change their lives to having less. And thats Gretas whole point but it is flying over everybodys head because she has become a celebrity. And thats a very sad thing. The message Greta has would have been communicated better if she didn`t take a year off and denied her fame instead of using it as a tool. The fame factor will be her weak point and the thing that will blur her message and lead to her failure. I predict that she will be gone by next winter.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Blat Fattery", "channel": "UCXGu1U8ABI9SUT1ZVLkeu-A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQPZL0o6qQEvUtiWYblSTDh9FAiYEvSglHfmK9m=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Just to let you know, global warming is an epidemic that does not only exist, but is going to affect later generations. In fact, you can see it yourself! 2 years ago it was 71 degrees on Christmas day. This past halloween it was 65 degrees, and it was nighttime. An ice cap the size of Delaware broke off in Antarctica. I recently got back from a trip to Iceland and there was no snow on any mountain tops. 30 years ago, there was snow everywhere. Maybe you could step outside of your basement and look around you. You'll be surprised that global warming is real and could affect your friends children!

At 16 you have a fragment of what really the world is, even with the aid of the internet. To me this is publicity, maybe for a good cause, but with the wrong means. I wonder what her parents drive, does she have electricity? What is she eating? Where is their supplies coming from? How are they produced? She used a train to get there. Where does its power coming from? Electricity...where is electricity coming from? Everything is linked. You cannot talk about climate change when all your life is surrounded by services that actually affect the climate (anyone in doubt do your research). on the matter of going to school or not, you’re not going to school just to become a scientist, you are going to school to educate yourself, to “open” your mind to knowledge. Whether someone goes to school or not won’t make a difference. The only person that gets affected from this choice is the person who made it. She better get back to be 16 and educate herself and see where this path will take her, along with raising awareness about the climate, and enjoy her teenage years.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "PanosUK", "channel": "UCbwO0ETo6B5svzYbh95cYKA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR3frzI47RyCjNgD0hbJidvQGAJz0vdABCEBAIy=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Those people are a part of an elite and she will most likely feel so awkward for so long it will bring her into an introverted depression again. Her father is with her and you can tell he is manic person that could suffer from anxiety and panic attacks.

Except Trump everyone knows that climate change is real and that emissions need to be controlled, but the actual doing part is not as easy as mentioning about the problem. I've worked in the renewables industry for 3+ years now, and I can tell you confidently that developments are taking place. Huge and meaningful ones. But it's not a one day process. Energy is the basis of every process in the world. 90% of the energy was sourced through fossil fuels. The numbers are dropping now. Improvements are taking place. The sheer scale of the problem is such that the results take their sweet time to come to surface. The Scandinavian countries are today powered by renewables to the extent of as much as 80%. Idk why instead of actually doing their bit by planting a tree each week or so,   people think just putting it on administration is the solution. We need to be realistic. Airplanes cause a lot of pollution. Doesn't mean we can even reduce the air traffic. Cars cause pollution. Everyone knows that. But not everyone can afford a Tesla. Money DOES matter more.

The angle will be earth being destroyed and the future will be what happens afterwards. Once the earth is destroyed all of us humans will be dead but don't worry matter can't be destroyed ni matter what. Meaning a new planet will be formed at 100 % health, the the plantet will drift in space till it finds a sun (burning star), once found it will revolve around the sun for a few thousand years heating up. Once at the proper temperature an atmosphere will form then trees. Once all that's down due to the heat the bacteria will evolve over the course of millions of years. Now that we have bacteria that's evolved in to animals and there are trees an a atmosphere, it's kind of like there's a NEW EARTH.

Third now that your attention is on the correct subject (Climate Change not Greta) you will most likely support your hateful rhetoric with anecdotes, psuedoscience, and baseless conspiracy theories. This is a defense and seems to be the only defense you have against the feeling like you are losing something when the evidence speaks directly and rationally. But perhaps you don't believe in evidence. Evidence can be wrong right? Can the Evidence of 97% of the world's scientists be wrong? I submit to you the Evidence may be an estimation (because besides you, no one knows the future with any certainty) If evidence is not enough for you and certainty is what you are after and denial is your thesis, submit evidence to support your certainty that the IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report on Climate Change is a baseless estimation, pseudoscience, or part of a vast conspiracy. Please support these with evidence to weight your argument with certainty. Fourth, now that you so desperately have managed to explicate an argument full of vitriol, logical fallacies, and wild anecdotes take a deep breath and consider for a moment that you might be wrong and what if you are? What then? Is it possible for you to be wrong? If not why must it be impossible for you to be wrong?

What's more, deposits left from boats can change the water's chemistry, adding too much of certain compounds, like zinc and copper, or making an environment overly alkaline or acidic.

Most people know too well the story of the manatee, whose populations dropped drastically after motorized boats began touring their shallow habitats around Florida. Because manatees are notoriously slow-moving ― the sloths of tropical water ― they cannot avoid the exceedingly speedy watercraft, and collisions with hulls or scrapes by propellers often do fatal harm. However, propellers alone cannot take responsibility for even a small percentage of damage done to freshwater and marine wildlife.\nIn fact, a large amount of impairment to wildlife is caused by smaller, less noticeable aspects of boats. Chemicals used to clean, protect, and run watercraft often leach into the water, severely impacting the environment and weakening or killing the wildlife. Aquatic plants and animals have specific requirements for light, temperature, pH level, and more, and toxins from detergents, paints, petroleum products, batteries, and metals have disastrous effects on wildlife’s ability to survive and thrive, including cancer, mutations, birth defects, and outright death.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "O's Auto Glass", "channel": "UC1fRwIK-nX5OvZA_njCapeA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSS6gC5amh9jqqFtu2_8dDN_pwkL_Zrhrav-AR-=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Much of which have been lost to time or melted into the works of so many others in this political BS session that has been the 'Carbon Tax' and 'Global Warming'. Used largely to scare the public and tax the people. But now we are seeing Climatological changes on Earth. But who is in the driver seat? Human's? The Sun? The Earth? Much of the Earth's climate cycles last over 20,000-100,000 years and weren't even understood or accepted until a few decades ago. For the longest time it was assumed Earth was always relatively stable. Now we understand there have been unbelievable changes to the Earth. All of which have occurred without the influence of Man. Degree changes that spanned 15° changes, not the 3° I keep hearing about now.\n\n\nThe point is; We know so very little about this spherical terrarium we inhabit.

First, this kid needs a hug, some serious help with her fear and anxiety about her future and LOTS OF LOVE.  I respect her passion.  \n\nI’m thinking that filtering the message of climate catastrophe through a beautiful Swedish child is simply ...ineffective.  I think the message of climate catastrophe is much LESS believable, not more so, because it is now being delivered by a child with several serious mental health issues rather than learned scientific experts in the field.  I certainly understand the emotional appeal of such a messenger, of course.  As one who also suffers from mental illness, that is NOT MY POINT.  The fact that she is a child, IS.  Who is looking out for her immediately, here and now, let alone ten years down the road?\n\nWhat is the purpose in having a child—a 15 or 16 year old child—talking about an EXTREMELY SERIOUS ISSUE before a group of people we are hoping will take reasonable and appropriate actions to deal with it.  I’d much rather that those actions dealing with climate change globally are based upon fact and resulted from an abundance of sound reasoning than as a result of blatant, thinly veiled appeal to emotion.  That’s no way to solve our problems.  The questions she raises far outnumber the issues resolved in her address.\n\nGretta is simply another distraction that will prove disastrous to the efforts of global action for climate change.  Her presence detracts from the very reality she’s attempting to unveil by giving opposing viewpoints yet another thing with which to object—rather than cornering them to deal directly with the issue at hand.  Keeping the issue “fact based” and free from theatrics—driving inexorably towards real solutions using the factual, proven evidence and based upon reason is by far the speediest, most effective and most efficient way to go. 😕", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "W.

So I sick of seeing placards and global statements and rhetoric. For example we desperately need to starting reducing at source the muck into waterways and oceans.. this is a desperate , as ice cleaning them up. We need to make this an absolutely nation wide action and press federal governments to start funding these. I recently wrote to a university student about this who was doing his PhD but was completely ignored because he had his own group it seemed, I was very disappointed. It’s time for specifics, identifying issues wit water industry people and citizens what must be done, developing priorities, and developing spreadsheet action plans. This might be a no 1 priority for government. Community development with subject matter experts, University ‘experts’ , consultants students, farmers is required.

The remainder is due to solar cycles. All UN predictions for sea level rise and population displacement for 2010 then 2015 have come and gone without happening but they have no contrition. US carbon dioxide emissions have flattened in the last 20 years but China is more than the US and all of Europe put together. The total carbon required to build wind turbines and solar farms is 110% greater than they could ever offset in their lifetime of use and they produce vast amounts of heavy metal toxicity in production with no plan for decommissioning. Wind machines slice and dice 6 million birds and bats each year, many endangered species. NASA satellite studies show that in the last 20 years 50% of the earth's surface is greener and increased its biomass at least 14% due to slightly warmer temps and increased carbon dioxide which plants need for growth. We are at 400ppm co2 in the atmosphere now, which is one of the lowest levels in earth's history. When flowering plants first evolved on the planet the earth was at 2500ppm co2 and there were redwoods and gingko forests in Canada stretching to the arctic. The Climate alarmist propaganda demonizes all climate scientists who are realists and study the facts and data. The push is to control our lives, not save the planet. To everyone who loves the planet, I suggest look at the real science and leave the propaganda mills of the politicians, main stream news, celebrities and especially the UN.

The IPCC even revises past temperature data to push this hoax.  Here are a few 100% FACTS:  #1. There is not more severe weather (even falsifying hurricane severity data is attempted).  #2. The Earth has been warming for ~500 years, since the end of a little ice age (did CO2 cause that???).  #3. The fastest rate of increase happened a hundreds of years ago (before CO2 was a \"factor\").  #4. Of all the greenhouse effects, CO2 is responsible for less than a few percent.  #4. The original scientist that claimed a correlation between CO2 and GW recanted, saying he was wrong.  #5.  Even using erroneous climate models, even 100-200 trillions $ in taxes globally, the Paris Climats would only reduce temps fractions of a degree.  #6. A serious increase in CO2 is caused by moving low carbon footprint migrants from 3rd world countries to high carbon footprint 1st world countries.  Why is this NEVER adressed???

Look into it just a bit deeper and it becomes obvious that the opposite is true. Meat (ruminant meat, more specifically) is calorie dense and contains everything that is essential for humans to live.  Ruminant animal meat is mostly dealt with in local/regional markets. (i.e.- less global scale shipping and all associated emissions). When grown in its natural state (i.e.- grazed and not factory farmed), it creates a rather natural cycle with the land it grazes on. Given all the land we dedicate for grain crop growth, we could easily switch over to a system of responsible ruminant animal farming that is sustainable.Vegetable and grain crops are much less calorie/nutrient dense (i.e.- you need more grams of it to sustain life). Vegetable and grain consumption increases the number of bowel movements in humans (i.e.- a greater stress on our infrastructure and water management systems). And the vegetable and grain markets are massive in scale (i.e.- large swaths of land are razed. Massive amounts of water are used. Natural ecosystems are displaced, and very large numbers of insects and small animals are killed. Pesticides, even organic ones, are relied upon to grow the plants but pollute the environment. These crops are shipped all across the world, increasing emissions. Massive amounts of crops never make it to market, because they don't appear picture perfect. Most of the grain crops are used as the backbone of the processed food markets, which are deleterious to human health. Further, processed foods require factories for processing and all the associated emissions and energy usage.)As for the health aspects of veganism vs meat eating, once you equalize for life style (i.e.- taking smoking, drinking, and processed food consumption into account), one does not appear to be any healthier than the other in a statistical sense. As for the idea that vegetables and grains are required for health, this is hotly debated topic at the moment...with much of the data leaning towards carnivore diets being mechanistically healthier for humans.The point here is, 'going vegan' to help the environment doesn't make any logical sense. It seems to me that vegans are proselytizing and adjoining themselves with climate activists with cherry picked, poorly constructed studies to further their stated position of being morally correct.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "L Mat", "channel": "UCuzHoNh4zhKvSSEs-tri-rg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTcoh861R2BXgODbTheQjB0V-Qre17e0cqe9A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The important factor here you're not considering in your reply is the point about these ruminant animals grazing in a natural way. I agree that factory farming of animals is not a good way to go about it. Factory farms feed them grains (not their natural food) and then try to handle the health consequences with antibiotics. These animals are built to eat grass. If left to graze, they are essentially eating a highly regenerative plant matter that is unavailable to humans for food and turn that into the most nutrient dense food human can eat in its most bioavailable form.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "L Mat", "channel": "UCuzHoNh4zhKvSSEs-tri-rg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTcoh861R2BXgODbTheQjB0V-Qre17e0cqe9A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The last scence was heartwarming but a bit cringey, because all people who applauded will probably keep on living in ways that contribute to climate change, and dont prevent it. The girl herself raises awareness of the public on this issue rather effectively but doesn't really present methods to solve it, which is what I'm missing here. Therefore I'll just add a few brief things that everyone can do to live a more climate neural life: \n\nDon't fly and don't eat meat, milk, eggs or cheese. These things are all unnecessary. Especially the whole animal industry, that contributes to most of the green house gases (51%!!!).  Therefore we should get our priorities straight and make rational decisions. As a vegan I can add that a plant based diet is not just the best for the climate, but also the best for your health, in preventing and reversing diseases like diabetis, obesity, stroke, high bloodpressue, and cancer, which are however directly caused by the hormones, fats and cholesterol, found in meat, milk, egg and cheese... It might be worth adding that in a vegan diet, no living being has to disgustingly suffer and die for merely the stimulation of something insignificant and primitive as just minutes of simulation of our tastebuds, that's immediately forgotten afterwards anyways... \n\nEvery claim in this comment has been scientifically proven.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "ShadowZZZ", "channel": "UCb94VCzy71hQXxZqXyPa4Jg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/xwhSk3bZE97vRiMf3Dw90l3hHmg5baCVkUDff4I9C4aZZT7t8hLl29v4x559RwWnrqiJRnFCpw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

She says Sweden needs to reduce emissions by 15%..where did she get that figure? We don't see the science because it's not there - and climate change scientists have been shown to be a dishonest lot - in Australia, figures were fudged and people fired because of their beliefs (or lack of).

There is no infrastructure in place and such infrastructure would increase pollution and power consumtion on such a scale that it's not much of a solution to begin with. Air, solar and wave power production is not sustainable from a power grid perspective. It scares me that so many people in the business knows this and wont speak up due to the current social climate. It scares me even more when educated people doesn't take the time to read up on how the power grid actually works. \n\n Oh fine EU could possibly put up a Sahara wide solar power plant and use brand new aluminum direct current cables. But that would mean going colonial again because of the political situations (plural intended). This also has serious weather related issues. So that's pretty much a pipe dream. \n\n The only available way to currently decrease CO2 emissions in a meaningful way is to go nuclear for the time being. Then hope we are able to create fusion plants in the future. That or we can go back to a world without computers, TVs, cars, propeller ships and back to a world with wide scale famine and sickness. You'd need to kill at least half of the worlds population to do that. Will you sacrifice your family in order for the world to go back to the 19th century?

{"cid": "Ugw0VtiouXJ40hnQXV54AaABAg", "text": "Greta is very impressive and inspirational, but I think the main reason people are not doing anything. Is because they cannot agree what should be done. Basically we are following an entirely wrong approach. We have been trying to change the world through individual choice. We have tried to get individuals to fly less, drive less, eat less meat etc.\n\n\nBut this is simply the WRONG way to go about it. Yes we must also act individually, but REAL change can only be accomplished collectively. I am willing to fly using clean fuel. But to me as a consumer that is not a choice that is available.  An airplane could be fueled with bio-fuels or electro-fuels which are zero emissions. But as a single individual I cannot make plane companies offer me the green choice. It is a collective decision we must make. We must vote in green parties which will create laws to e.g. require airplane companies to  offer green choices. \n\n\nThe second BIG problem with our current individual choice approach, is the freeloader problem. It is hard to motivate people to go green while everybody else is polluting. However people are much better at making the right choice if they know that others will join them collectively. If I was alone paying twice the price to fly green I may not have the motivation to do it. But if I knew half the population did it, I would do it, because I would not want to be worse than the majority.\n\n\nWe humans are conformist. We chose to better ourselves when we see others around us do it. When others don't, it is hard, only special people like Greta Thunberg who are great moral leaders will do that. The rest of us don't have that great moral standard.

Now since the straws has to be clean and contain no bacteria it WAS wrapped in plastic, and if we start to use metal straws they would likely be wrapped too.

No longer a scientific movement.\n\nYou started by using pictures and videos of polar bears to further your climate change campaign, but when the truth was that they are thriving you have moved on. Changed it to a child to build emotion. \n\nI believe climate change is real, i however do not believe we have any impact on it, nor do i believe the falsity's that have come to light from the climate alarmists.\n\nSea level rise, warming of the earth, ice caps melting. they have all been inconstantly wrong,\n\nThe sea levels haven't risen even a fraction of the amount predicted, the ice caps have melted on one side of the planet and formed on the other so there has been no deficit in ice and the warming trends do not match human carbon production. Going from them you would think that climate change took a few years off heating up and then re-appeared randomly.  \n\nThe scientists who were previously part of IPCC have come out and called it a hoax, Nasa ex-scientists call it a hoax, the scientific organisations who get funding have miraculously changed their figures over time to match the climate change agenda.\n\nThe \"97%\" of scientists which were actually a hand  picked group of 30,000 scientists who were the only ones who claimed man could have an impact through fossil fuels were selected. Of this consensus they were asked if they think we could have an impact, small or not, that can include a \"i think\" not a i know. \n\nThe truth about co2...well its factually proven to increase the rate of growth that plants have. The more co2 the quicker they grow and thrive, they use less water as well due to co2. \n\nco2 comes from our oceans, volcanoes thousands of natural areas. We contribute 3%, so you are saying that if a few volcanos were to erupt,and they will. They will cause more damage than man kind, its false. \n\nThe fact that extinctions have happened... do we expect no species to become extinct, do we have dinosaurs still? No we dont, that is nature and its adapt or die.\n\nPlastic and waste is the real issue across the world, not climate change. \n\nYou can find that the predictions made havent come to light, so the alarmists have now followed the trend on warming and re-fiddled their figures whilst exaggerating the impacts. \n\nThis is a unproven theory that has been publically promoted by media, politicians and any climate analyst who gets funding from either of them. If you claim against it.. you are outcasted, you wont get funded, you wont get promoted. Because panic funds research.\n\nThe solution we are given? Increase in taxes.. increase in money spent.

However, I would like to firmly point out that some of your statistics, unfortunately, are flawed. Specifically, I would like to target my response at the 5 minute and 10-second mark to the 5 minutes 20-second mark. Your logic is correct, no doubt about that, but your examples are out of date and unreliable. I would like to include some factual stats. In the year 2018, India became the fastest growing economy, as well as the most technologically advancing nation on Earth. India is set to overtake the Chinese economical status by 2040, and the United States even sooner, by 2035. India has also become one of the Nuclear Triad, and also has the capability to target foreign satellites, joining an elite club originally comprised of the US, China, and Russia. Also, the Indian Sanitation Program has made great leaps in rural areas and has cleaned up relatively most of India, only to mention a few. Therefore, for these reasons and beyond, I beg to disagree and ask to change the mention of the nation India from the list of poor nations.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Sumanth Ganapathi Basavapatna", "channel": "UC2LX2Fvsxa0hJiSLoJ-3u4g", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRjAC6gKxFKGvP1qCOAbuCkXzNDGrgCDCm-FLpW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It’s with a million small action. So you don’t need to become vegan, or even vegetarian if you can’t. You don’t need to go zero waste if that’s hard to realize at this time of your life. Just try to cut down on meat and dairy as much as YOU can. Try oat milk if you want. Maybe skip takeouts tonight and use the money you saved to go the extra mile for bulk shopping with your own containers. Those are suggestions but you don’t have to do them. As long as you’re doing what you can, I’m proud of you and it is enough, I promise.

{"cid": "UgwL-1y8AKTnnvsttCh4AaABAg", "text": "What she was saying almost sounded a bit contradictory initially. At first when giving examples of how the world politicians etc do nothing about climate change if it’s that important to our existence why are they not talking about it all the time and enforcing change. I thought her talk was going to go down the route of how climate change is perhaps not as real as they have made out well especially in relation to how us humans impact it. There are some scientists who believe our climate is cyclical and not based on our habits. Yes the earth is warming but over periods of thousands of years this has happened naturally periods of warming ice ages etc. You can’t look at it over a few hundred years. It is considered that the powers that be just go on about climate change as a means of control by the elite and to bring about a carbon tax. Those that rule the world will know the truth and I believe if it really was a crisis that could be averted by how we live then they would have enforced change long ago. I’m 43 I remember this supposed crisis being talked about when I was 16 yet we still have oil etc. Makes you think about what is the real truth and agenda!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Laura Smith", "channel": "UCJbxNkTDueWACyjY0IqiQzQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQSTbqzP4JRKCEdJHU-h7lkQ72c0qy1B9tYkA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The aim is to reduce emissions to 95% below 1995 emissions by 2050.\r\n\r\nGiven that greater than 80% of global energy requirements will be met by fossil fuels into 2050 it follows that if we actually do meet those emissions targets that means GDP cut by 95% too. \r\n\r\nThere is no reasonable expectancy to replace energy from fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. Wind turbines, solar panels and the like are not scalable to produce enough energy to meet demands, particularly when it comes to key industries such as making steel, concrete, and fertilizer. Further wind turbines and solar farms really are bad for the environment.\r\n\r\nThe only conclusion is that Carbon tax is about choking off our freedom by reducing access to cheap reliable plentiful energy.\r\n\r\nThe statement oft heard is 'what kind of world do we want for our children?'

The authors and contributors to that report consists of the Worlds most prominent scientists, climatologists, independant organizations and authorities from the majority of the Worlds counties. \n\nAccording to the IPCC report, human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052, if it continues to increase at the current rate.\n\nI am aware of Grand Solar Minimum. Solar physicists studies on this phenomenom shows that a recurrence of these solar conditions would not offset the expected rise in global mean surface temperature this century due to human activities. However, they do find a larger cooling effect from low solar activity on regional climates, particularly over Europe in winter.\n\nYou are in a up-hill battle, buddy.

You make the statement that \"people cannot afford that \"(stopping emissions) but there is no choice if the human race wants to survive. Would we rather suffer through difficult financial times, or literally die along with half of the worlds other species. This is not an exaggeration. Scientist say 50% of the species we share the planet with will be gone in just 80 years, and do you know what is hit the hardest? Those at the top of the food chain, mammals. Guess what humans are? \nAgenda 21 was published in 1992 with full-scale implementation for all of the problems that you just outlined. It has been continually updated (now Agenda 2030) sustainable development goals. There was zero political will to implement the changes that were difficult then, and more difficult now. The longer it takes, the more difficult it will be, however, yes the changes and solutions needed have been long known. There was all the money needed to bail out the auto industry, bail out the banks and bail out the housing crisis. But it is always said it is too expensive to save the planet. If only a portion of the money we right now give to oil companies in subsidies was put into - say electric cars, they would be cheaper than the gas cars are now. It is the lack of will and the fact that the politicians are bought and paid by the fossil fuel industry that stops this from happening. \nI hear this argument a lot, and I ask, you worry that you cannot afford a new electric car, but the worry will change to you cannot afford food (need is expected to rise 60% while the planets ability to produce is dropping by 40%) and you cannot find fresh drinking water (Approx half the worlds fresh water is melting into the sea), then how important will the worry for the expense of a new car seem. A person can survive without a car quite a bit easier than without food and water. Economy and ecology must be balanced and for decades it has been out of balance in favor of economy, so yes, there will be a price to pay for our inaction. There is a penalty for in-action and now it is time to pay up. We have caused the problem and now want to fix it, but not hurt anyone. That is not possible.

Peep should pay attention to crop varieties as well and which ones are liable to diseases that are spreading. Anyone looking at coffee production in Central America is going to get a big insight into migration increase from there. Look at banana disease spread and potato and cassava heat effects on production. Red is safer than Burbank or Russet. Greenland isn't going to be the lead sea level rise contributor, West Antarctica will be, but even so all melt will lag thermal expansion. So knowing eyes will factor in subsidence, salt infiltration and look for coastal dead forests to signal sea level rise from aerial photography, which can also signal drought. N.B. changes in planting zones and species that are already shifting ranges. Finally, I think the ones who will implement public policy will be the military, keeping order in disaster zones. They won't be shutting down any coal plants but they do keep track of climate science because its already compromised two naval marine bases in the US and threatens many coastal bases.

Gandhi was great, there is no doubt about it. \nBritish rule divided the country. \nAnd Hinduism teaches about sustainable living since very beginning.  That is what the parent comment was about.\nFor eg. Sattvic food is what should be consumed by humans. It includes vegan diet +dairy, but the cow should be taken care of like mother, the calf should have had its share from the milk only then one should milk the cow for the dairy. But nowadays dairy is nothing but exploitation of cattle. This is not sattvic food, rather is considered sinful. \nWe should protect trees and our religion teaches that by numerous festivals involving worshipping of different trees. (For the debatable oldest religion on the earth, its pretty scientific). The polytheism has most of its gods around nature only. Bapu (as we call him here) was a follower of Hinduism. \nGandhi used single cloth (khadi, purely cotton) which he weaved by himself, grew his own food, had his own cattle. He lead a life what today is named as minimalist living. \nIf someone follows Hinduism from its roots, it nurtures the nature rather than to  exploit the nature.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "aakansha agarwal", "channel": "UCOOa4vy6F64dSWM47C83PQQ", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS5nzFFdtEXbFJhP6saOj1NhieClTrZSFWDxg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There is already a double digit increase in kidney dysfunction among ag workers in Central America due to increased heat and dehydration. Habitat loss is the present leading animal extinction factor, so there won't be time for climate grace for lucky species. Sea level rise saw a stepwise increase in 2008 and another after 2013, so it is not increasing at a constant nor predictable rate. Wikipedia says \"The sea-level rise due to Antarctica has been estimated to be 0.25 mm per year from 1993–2005, and 0.42 mm per year from 2005 to 2015. All datasets generally show an acceleration of mass loss from the Antarctic ice-sheet, but with year-to-year variations.\" Those with math skills can observe a doubling time of eight years and shortening, meaning that we can expect sea level rise to increase dramatically in coming decades, even conservative sources like the IPCC are now predicting six feet this century instead of the 3 feet they predicted a few years ago. Finally, moving a billion people or more out of equatorial zones, and rebuilding fertile soils in Arctic regions is not something humans can do quickly, especially as it seems this effort is not happening now and the brand new Arctic seed vaults are already flooding.

Have a varied diet, make some days of your week vegetarian or vegan. Many schools in my country have at least one day of only vegan food. \n\nAvoid fast fashion.\nFast fashion is what you call mass production of clothing, often in bad working environments and extremely bad for the climate. Two very huge fast fashion brands are H&M and Zara. When buying clothing check with the store/brand on where the clothes are produced. The best option to avoid fast fashion is to get hand-me-downs or shop at thrift stores, which actually seems to be gaining popularity with the younger generations.\n\nBuy only what you need.\nThink hardly before buying anything: Do I really need this? Is this really necessary or is it just because of aesthetic, self-satisfactory or popularity reasons?\n\nStop using plasting bags and other single-use plastics.\nA plastic bag has an extremely short lifespan, mostly only lasting from the shop and then to your home. There are many other safer options than plastic bags such as regular bags, backpacks or tote bags(which also seem to be getting popular). Single-use plastics can range from anything such as plastic straws, cutlery, candy wrappers to plates. Replace that plastic straw with one made out of a reusable material like bamboo or metal, please reduce your consumption of candy and bring cutlery with you if needed.\n\nPublic transport.\nAs uncomfortable as it may be to sit on a bus or a train, it is a better option than to use a private car. More people sharing things means less production of said thing.\n\nPlease add to this list if you want to, we need more alternatives to better ourselves and save the planet.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Lilly", "channel": "UCt6dvt8O93ukZqHsVgGfojw", "votes": "23", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQH93A_49CAlAmbE5fo275uIeq1nmJQHk7rcSBd=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The current scientific thought is that the Earth has about 5 billion years left. The lifespan of the earth is wholly dependent upon the ageing of the sun. In about 5 to 6 billion years from now, the sun is going to reach a point where its core can no longer sustain the nuclear fusion as it has been and it will evolve into a red giant. Therefore, that means the sun could grow large enough to engulf the earth, but even if it doesn't, life will still cease to exist on earth at some point during the sun's transformation into a red giant.

Not necessarily for WHAT she said, but rather the simple fact that this diminutive young teenager is wiser than 99% of the whole world and graced with eloquence and penetrating awareness of our current predicament.

I do wonder about the extent to which she understands that those who rule this world, the bankers, the oil tycoons, the military top brass, the top commanders of the secret space program, the top commanders of the global geoengineering agenda, etc etc ARE CLINICALLY AND CRIMINALLY INSANE AND, AMONG MANY OTHER AGENDAS, ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A MASSIVE DEPOPULATION AGENDA TO RID THE PLANET OF MOST OF US. Part of what I glean from her primary message is unfortunately \"accusatory\". That is to say, I feel as though we, the average folks of this world who work and raise our kids AND SO ON... are the CAUSE OF OUR CURRENT PRECARIOUS PREDICAMENT. And in a certain way she would be right. Her \"accusatory\" tone is, I am sure, more a call to action than an indictment. That said, she needs to wrap her mind around just exactly how deep the rabbit hole goes vis-a-vis the psychopaths who run this world and their army of complicit humans. But who knows?

I think it's difficult to find solutions and if we have them they are very costly. And if we have a solution, found a way to pay for we still need people willing to work for it. We should teach the young people that it's not always that simple and not applaud to them for skipping school. We should teach them how to solve problems so they can see how hard it is amd develop, not putting them on stage to amplifie the emotions of the masses. This is the task of parents and teachers. After all, why don't they demonstrate after school? Would that be too much action? Lastly, I'm not in favor of promoting alarmism (im any field) via children, activists and politicians.

Snowy playgrounds of my childhood!\r\n\r\nIn those days we had snow many times during the winter. It was rather normal to have some 40-50 cm fresh snow every week in December, January, and February.\r\nI remember my grandfather shoveling snow off the ground for hours, while my friends and I had our good time playing in the backyard and went skiing down the slopes in the pine forest nearby.\r\n\r\nNow everything is different here. Last time I visited my parents' house I've recovered the shovel my grandfather used... it was in the garage, covered with rust and dust, its handle no longer usable.. it hasn't been used for years  (last big snow was in 2000!). Now, we just have some 1-2 cm snow once or twice a season!! \r\n\r\nEven up in the mountains, our ski resorts now have to massively use artificial snow to extend the duration of the skiing season.\r\n\r\nSuch a great change has happened in just 3/4 decades. Global warming is definitely a great threat, we must take a stand to stop it!\r\n\r\nWe, adults, MUST listen to the voices of our children: It is not too late to stop climate change, but we have to act now!

The \"Rising ocean level\" is non-existent. They (IPCC) now tries to spread panic about the CO2 levels instead, and ties it to the planetary rise of temperature (0,2 C. last year) Neglecting the findings of some non PC scientist, that earth temperature in the last 10 000 years fluctuated within \"small iceage\" (The last one between year 1350-1850) and year 850 och 1250 A.D. with considerable  warmer climate ( Wich made it possible to harvest wheat on Greenland, as the viking colonys did, or harvest grapes on the british Isles). As they say : we are in the middle of a natural fluctuation upwards trend, that will end soon and then the earth temperature will cool down again. \nWhat I dont know is why the consensus of CO2=rising earth temperatures would be a result of burning fossil fuels ? We have all the data collected. Earth temperature fluctuates as a natural phenomenon. What makes me nervous about the global elite climate alarmist exaggeration is that it presents an opportunity to form a world government acting as a  superstructure to dictate and expanding a power alliance of wich we ordinary folks dont know nothing about. Im highly skeptic about this ... If they use school children to get the message across, makes me personally think there is something behind it. Stir up emotions and the powerful will step in to \"Fix\" the problem, but ONLY if they are given the mandate to manifest radical measures..not only linked to the Climate, but in so many other fields of special interest for the powerful.

Leute, bleibt doch nur für einen Moment stehen und schaltet das Hirn wieder ein: da Ihr, genau wie diejenigen die euch die Angst einjagen nicht in die Zukunft schauen könnt, gönnt euch doch einmal einen Blick in die erdgeschichtliche Vergangenheit! Die ist gesicherte Zeitgeschichte und bestens bekannt. Fangt nicht mit 1850 an, sondern mit 100.000 vor Christus. Vergleicht das Klimageschehen von einst mit dem von heute: Ihr werdet feststellen war alles schon einmal und mehrfach da! Viel wärmer, viel kälter, viel näßer oder viel trockener, mal für wenige hundert Jahre oder über mehrere Jahrzehntausende hinweg. Egal ob mit Menschen an Bord der Erde oder nicht, aber niemals, nicht ein einziges mal war am Klimageschehen das arme CO² ursächlich beteiligt. Das CO² war vielfach höher (was gut für flora und fauna der Zeit war...), aber auch schon niedriger  als heute. Das belegt das es keinen ursächlichen Zusammenhang zwischen Erderwärmung/Klimageschehen gibt!

People, just stand there for a moment and switch your brain back on: since you, just like those who scare you can not look into the future, yet allow yourself a glimpse into the geological past! This is secure history and well known. Do not start with 1850, but with 100,000 BC. Compare the climatic events of yesteryear with those of today: you will find everything has happened once and more than once! Much warmer, much colder, much wet or much drier, sometimes for a few hundred years or over several decades. Whether with people aboard the earth or not, but never, not once was the climatic events the poor CO² causally involved. The CO² was much higher (which was good for flora and fauna of the time ...), but also already lower than today. This proves that there is no causal connection between global warming / climatic events!

My grandmother taught me a lot growing up even everything when it comes down to food. True I do eat meat and I do have dairy however I only eat what I need. I don't go out looking to eat everything. I collect a mixture of meat and veg along with plants and other sources. Depending on what I make, I will not waste it, I reuse it the next day or make it into something else to eat. As my nan always told me \"we didn't have the luxury of buying food excessily in my day, we survived on what we had, we didn't waste and we could make anything out of everything and it worked, we had what was 'necessary' to survive and that's all that mattered\". I live by those words, I live by everything she taught me. Big industries and companies need to stop making stuff that breaks down fast, sustainability in their products can help reduce waste complete. Also good parenting on youths today who are abusing the system because they have not got the educational background to help them understand what they are doing is wrong. Plant fruit and veg in the garden, grow your own food, have healthy plants in the house to reduce carbon dioxide. Don't use heating unless absolutely necessary. There are so many things that can be done. Instead of sitting back and saying I'll do it tomorrow, start today.

Sometimes it's even both, if meat or dairy is exported. Aside from that, it takes space for plants that are desperately needed to compensate already existing emissions. Of course you are not wrong when you say we should opt for new solutions. This however doesn't mean that in the meantime we shouldn't at least try to reduce our carbon footprint. It doesn't matter if half of the world becomes vegan or if meat consumption is cut down by half globally. It will still have an amazing impact on the environment. The fact that animals and insects are dying is also linked to how fields are designed. Monocultures don't offer a variety of food sources, so insects can't pollinate. Rapeseed is a good example for this, it's completely useless for wildlife. By cutting down the demand for meat we can potentially create new overgrown wildlife areas (namely there were livestock feed used to be grown), which doubles as a food source for animals and insects as well as transforms CO2.

Although who cares but I think we have to start somewhere. \n              Though we already have but do politicians want to own our air control now.

Should we not be reducing non environmental practices. Also reducing carbon producing energy of any kind to like 0. How about no oil energy, nuclear energy and get a local growing initiative for farmers markets by anyone with space and means to grow edible gardening and herbs too. \n                                           Why are we going to fund the air control and let the perpetual money hole of over aggressive market and over productive and over polluting practices.

Immigration allows the economy not to shrink through increasing the population. Canada adds one million people every two and a half years, for example.

Of course immigration is increasing the world's population quickly. The population has never accelerated at this speed in human history.

Why is it that all the predictions of doom and gloom haven't happened? How many tipping points do we need to pass to realize it's not happening? I feel sorry for those who are so gullible who get sucked in to an emotional response to \"take action\". You're being told that CO2 is a climate control, reduce it and things will be better. It's 0.0410 which is a really tiny number when your factoring in water vapor, hardly anything will change that, it's basic chemistry. It's like the equivalent of 2 people in a stadium of 100,000.

Industries are the ones doing this and they are also the ones that do not want to change. Until they stop and look for new ways and new solutions this is not gonna change. And if they do not make it easier for us to choose different ways of doing things (better, more natural and cheaper food; better, less contaminant, cheaper transportations; better and cheaper access to treatments and medicines for the diseases they actually provoke us and the animals with this contamination and so on) people will never bother to change either. People is lazy and industries make it worst by making life expensive and dangerous. \n\nThere was only one guy who once thought of humanity and not just himself. Ian Fleming discovered the penicillin, the thing we take nowadays for most minor colds, flu and so on that at the time were deadly health problems. Instead of trying to patent his discovery and be the richest person in the entire world, he openly gave it to anyone who could and would want to fabricate it, so every one could have access to it and give it to the needy.

All land transport can be converted to electric, powered by renewables, and we know how, but we need to share mobility to make the transition quick enough. It will also reduce the energy needed dramatically. Thermal management can be done much more efficiently with heat pumps. Buildings can be isolated and solar integrated. Short-range aircraft can be converted to electric too, long range aircraft to hydrogen (it is probably the hardest problem, since there is little potential in making them more efficient). Shipping in littoral waters can be done on a combination of wind and hydrogen. Large, heavy ships can use nuclear power, like carriers, ice breakers and submarines do today. We certainly need to reduce our meat consumption too. This is not a technological problem, we have all the technological solutions.

But, at the end, people stand up and clap and cheer - and then most of them drive home, eat meat the next day, continue as if they can't change anything so they won't bother. \n\nAlthough it's not easy, it IS possible to drastically change one's lifestyle. Admittedly I've been 'green' for 30+ years, but 10 years ago I took part in a competition to find the person i the UK with the lowest carbon footprint, and I won, with a figure just under a twelfth of the UK average. I don't live in a cave or wear a hair shirt - I'm self employed and use public transport and bike to travel to my work, I switched my household electricity to 100% renewables in 1999, I grow some of my own veg and cook veggie meals from simple ingredients. I'm not addicted to shopping and consuming - I prefer zero carbon pleasures, of which there are many.  Agreed not everyone would be able to live like me, but many could at least go part of the way there, but I see so few people trying. \n\nWill Greta's honest and direct impassioned speech change people's lives?  I hope so. She is one of the inspirations behind Extinction Rebellion, who are aiming to force governments worldwide to declare a Climate Emergency, to pledge to go zero carbon as soon as possible, and to try a new form of decisionmaking which would bypass the slow and often corrupt political procedures we have now.

BUT kinda ironic that this TedX site hosts another 'lecture' by a lady who notes that the one topic people seem afraid to talk about is overpopulation... so, 'are you fixed' so that you do not spawn more children?' It is also not about what you eat but what the demands will be for what our human locusts will need to eat to survive... consumption of beans as a 'vegetarian diet'.... hmm... in mine, more 'flatulence'. So, the vegan and vegetarian will espouse 'eating veggies' while the numbers of vegetarians grows and grows in places that are already primarily 'vegetarian', like India. More people equals more 'human locusts' of consumption... it is not about what we eat but about how WE are replacing all animal life on this planet by our consumption of EVERYTHING and there is less discussion about the flatulence WE are causing even if we shift from 'eating those flatulent cows and their byproducts'... WE need to start doing some simple math here and start declaring that WE will make one person or NO PERSON families OUR voluntary life goals. I was told in 1967, by my geography teacher that overpopulation WAS the primary problem facing the planet in the next 20 years... we are past that... my spouse wanted to have a third child. I had a son and daughter and refused to add to the world burden anymore... BUT rock stars like Mick Jagger will have ANOTHER child with a 20-something and there will be NO CONDEMNATION (he has fathered how many, is it 8???)

If you go to an area developed before the advent of the car, you'll find that most towns are no more than 10 miles apart -- making 10 miles round-trip the maximum you'd have to travel by horse, which is very doable (20 miles is about the max without stopping).  Horse transportation was, and is, still quite possible.  It's made easier where I live by the fact that many Amish are nearby, and I thus have easy access to harness shops.  In areas with more severe weather (I'm currently in Michigan, formerly was near Seattle), a bicycle is much less viable due to ice and snow.\n\nAlso, while we think of our energy use mostly in terms of direct use, the vast majority is used industrially and for public infrastructure.

Yes, carbon emissions and oil consumption of heavy transport vehicles, ships and aircraft is a major contributor to the problem. But the original poster wasn’t saying that livestock are the only problem. He was merely saying they’re an enormous problem. Waiting to attack this issue all in one go will result in us waiting forever. You can eat less, or no meat, even though it still comes at an environmental cost - offset the damage by maximizing opportunity costs towards reducing climate change, as opposed to increasing profits at the expense of climate.\n\nIt’s possible to deal with the livestock issue and the transportation issue at the same time. It’s not either or. Engineers are working hard to make green engines for all craft. Transport companies would LOVE to be rid of oil because it costs them all arms and legs. Green engines will be a monumental reduction in cost for them. My point is: it’s coming. They’re working on it. \n\nIn the meantime, you can stop eating meat, or eat much less, because that’s something you can do right now.

The corruption of the European Electricity Grid as well as the sinister practices of the Oil Lobby in Switzerland put a jackboot down on this project.  I thought that with the move of the climate scientists around COP24 would see a change.  I don't know how many cities I have written but I am also getting a little tired of talk.  I am waiting for Greta to talk about this concrete plan since I know it would work.  I took it from the IEA and the OECD countries and so this is not a wild-haired scheme.   Add a comment if you are willing to organize this in your city.

Consumerism, war, corruption, poverty, hunger, land exploitation, all of it. The common thread that runs through these things is the pursuit to accumulate (fictional) profits. But we have found a way to use all that capitalist momentum to render wealth accumulation moot, effectively eliminating the root cause of the vast majority of the world’s problems. The real beauty is that it’s a reorganization of accounting and business practice we use now anyway, and the more capitalism fights against it the more it contributes to its own demise. We use its own momentum. The net result is an array of solutions to problems that no longer exist. We have a few more experts to run this by to work out some nuances and then begin putting into practice in the new year.

Areas along the equator and sub tropics already have difficulty growing certain crops. Global temperatures higher than 2C will drastically reduce grain output and for every degree rise grain production reduces by 10%. Warmer temperatures can also give way to invasive pests.\n\nCO2 is part of the photosynthesis, and whoever doesn't know probably forgot about it in elementary school. There are problems with the narrative. \n- Increasing CO2 speeds up growth of some plants and this can reduce their nutritional value. \n- CO2 only benefits plants if there is sufficient water and if they aren't saturated, and there will be less consistency of precipitation and less of it reaching inland because of our pollution and deforestation. \n- We've increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere by 60ppm over the last 30 years, in addition to land and ocean intake.. So the conditions and species vary as to whether or not they will benefit, at least in the short term agriculture and plant life is expected to benefit. But I should let you know that the short term is getting shorter - less than a decade shorter. Understand that any drastic changes to the chemistry of our atmosphere and oceans will impose problems.\n\n Increased concentrations of CO2 by hundreds of ppm reduces cognitive ability.

They're targeting our kids with a story to own them to achieve their globalist goals. Who else did that throughout history? (Give me your kids for five years and the seeds I've sown...) \n\nTHAT SAID, the majority of climate scientists are not UN-funded and are ignored because their findings are not in line with the ''Global Warming'' theorists. It's so bad that now, UN is talking about ''Climate Change'' and no longer warming. \n\nOn that level, they would be correct. Climate has been evolving since planet Earth came into being and there's not a damn thing we can do about it, only adapt as we always have. A few hundred years ago, we went through another Little Ice Age and apparently, we're heading back to same. \n\nP.S.: What would be so bad about the climate warming up another 1 Celsius? Species will not die from that. We would have a slightly longer agricultural timeline to feed the sadly ever-expanding human population, the latter being the major problem.

The earth should have been cooling actually as we slowly move to the cooling phase of the orbital milankovitch cycle and the sun is in a very low activity solar cycle at the moment ie. maunder minimum which should have accelerated that natural cooling phase but we are heating up faster and faster. That means that we are more than 100% to blame on this because of our greenhouse gas emissions of Co2, Methane and nitrous oxide and that effect is so large that it not only completely negates all of the natural cooling mechanisms but is actually creating unprecedented levels of warming in the arctic especially.\n\nYou are right about the fact that we can only slow the warming and not stop it, massive amounts of energy per day, around 500 times more than all the energy humanity consumes per year has been and is increasingly being transferred to the oceans and they have been charging with heat like a huge battery. It will take hundreds of years or millennia to re-normalize the earths climatic system even if we completely stopped all emissions. But there is much more at stake than that, if we don't tackle this cataclysm with all our resources the heating could be so high as to cause a massive extinction level event like what happened at the End Permian extinction 256 million years ago or the PETM thermal maximum 55 million years ago.\n\nWe will not stop significant levels of warming but we can and absolutely should at all costs stop warming that is of a degree so high that it can threaten the extinction of most life on earth including humans if it is able to destabilize the massive methane in the arctic permafrost and underwater hydrates that would increase the greenhouse gasses magnitudes higher than what we have already released.
