Arctic sea ice before we had major anthropogenic (human-made) climate change would cause ice to melt and much of it would be intact leaving some older ice that has been in the region for a long time and especially during the summer. But in recent years because of our impact on fossil fuels and CO2, the percentage of intact ice in the Arctic has been decreasing by an average of 13.1% through the time period of 1979-2020. That means that we have an increase in the amount of water that will most likely cause issues and help create more anomalies in weather patterns. Also when we have permafrost and terrestrial ice like mountain snowcaps global warming is occurring many of the seasonal ice formations happen differently and there is more runoff and that is what will cause rising sea levels, not necessarily the ice already displacing water in the sea. These are issues and so not getting good evidence or cherry-picking evidence is not correct. Also, many of the ice actually reflects sunlight originally but the decreasing amounts of intact ice at certain times of the year cause heating because of the lack of presence.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Vighneshwar Anantharamakrishnan", "channel": "UCwca9WE-U5L9cxg5VFT3_eg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkNrEGTz4wBg0v1dx9P8_n86Sy1Rh8cmC-jOJO=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugyv7J-8CjIXztLh7gh4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

At the start of the industrial revolution they were at about 280ppm. In 1910 they reached 300ppm, a level not reached in the past 330,000 years. By 1961 they were about 316ppm. Today they are about 415ppm, a level not seen in millions of years. The reason for this is mankind's burning of fossil fuels has added a roughly 3% increase to the carbon flux. This may not seem like much, but it is just enough to tip the carbon cycle from equilibrium, to a state of accumulation. So CO2 levels aren't just rising, they are accelerating. Since the 1970's, solar irradiance has actually decreased, but temperatures have increased. Aerosol levels have also been increasing, but this should have a cooling effect on our planet's temperature, but that isn't what is happening.

{"cid": "UgzFWLEWBCQpqS8taPd4AaABAg", "text": "There is one fatal flaw with global warming (actually there is more than one flaw but I'll talk about them in due time.) That everyone I have seen push the idea, seems to ignore. It's a political belief instead of a scientific belief. For example the people that I have seen push global warming are politicians like bill and Hillary Clinton and we all know how trustworthy they are. (Monica Lewinsky incident). They have put theories that the world would end every 10 to 20 years, and guess what? Someone is reading this on earth, we are still alive. The global warming problem isn't what the environmentalists say. If it was the world would have ended by now. People will argue against this video because prager u is funded by a conservative company. Ok so? That argument would be clear proof that global warming is nothing more but a political belief. Second flaw, it's true that there are areas of the earth that are warmer, yes, however there are also areas of the earth that are colder so climate change would be a better word for it, and speaking of which, flaw three, they changed the name of global warming to climate change, which is another reason I dont believe in global warming. I'll put it to you like this, if you are going to state that something is affecting the world and you can't even agree on the name of the problem, what am I supposed to believe? Is it global warming or climate change? Be consistent with the name of the problem if you want people to believe you. And based off all of that I think global warming is a conspiracy theory created to scare the human race into stopping pollution. But that still doesn't make too much because of what happened when Barack Obama made a deal with China to stop factory production in the u.s. but China has no restrictions, people in certain parts of China have to wear masks to go outside because it's so polluted. If global warming is as big of a problem as the environmentalists claim then shouldn't we do something to stop the pollution in China?

{"cid": "UgyxSboDYh-ISRIz-W14AaABAg.8rzawRY8rCq8rzb1Ia2Qmf", "text": "1, The leading green house gas is water vapor and it's atmospheric concentration changes depending on region but it usually stays between 10000 and 50000 ppm. Current back ground CO2 concentrations currently stand at around 250 to 350. 400 if you're in a heavily populated city. \n2, The current percentages of green house gases currently stand at Water Vapor in front with a commanding lead of 95%, Followed by CO2 at 3.7%, Methane takes the third spot at 0.8% with Ozone and trace CFCs coming in last at 0.5%\n3, When Al Gore presented \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" He argued that you could compare temperature records with CO2 deposits in core ice samples and compare them. Standard deviation is basically how much wiggle room is he allowing in his analysis. A good standard deviation would have been four months to a year. His standard deviation was several hundred to several thousand years. That sort of tactic is only used when people don't have a good correlation and want to fudge the data to make it look like there is one, (any statistical analyst will tell you that). \n4, Al Gore claimed that all the pollution that man has created cause dramatic increase in earth's temperatures. Well how much is it? According to his own information all the CO2 that we have produced from the industrial revolution to the year 2000 managed to increase average world temperatures by .... 0.8 degrees Farenheit. That's less than a degree in over one hundred years. Hardly alarming, in fact it would be pretty difficult to corroborate effectively. \n5, Ever since the end of the little ice age (roughly the 1800's) temperatures have been steadily increasing. When you take the entire temperature record into account there appears to be no significant increase in temperatures after the industrial revolution, and certainly not in the last half century. \n6, There are only seven temperature reading stations for the entire continent of Antarctica. That means that we only have seven points of data for the entire south pole region. When you working with statistical models like the kind they're supposedly using to predict climate change require thousands of data point to even approach being accurate, that decidedly underwhelming. \n7, It's true polar ice mass in the arctic has been decreasing but as far as we can tell polar ice mass in the antarctic has been increasing over the past several decades. \n8, What is the optimal Carbon Dioxide level for plant photosynthesis? We honestly don't know. No one has ever found it. We do know that it's starts to displace oxygen and therefore kill off animal life at around 40000 ppm. (Before you freak out remember that 100 times normal background levels in places like NY, LA, and Beijing.) \n9, Another name for the Plystecine Ice Age is .. the modern era. We are technically living at the tail end of a very mild ice age. If we didn't there wouldn't even be polar ice caps. \n10, Thomas Gold was scientist who started his career in Astrophysics. He did much of the ground breaking work that made Stephen Hawkings work possible. Because of a falling out with NASA in the 80's he shifted his scientific focus to geology and ended up conducting some incredible experiments and proposing a well supported if controversial theory. He managed to prove that under intense heat and pressure carbon and water will actually alter their bonds and form long chain hydrocarbons. He therefore theorized that the term fossil fuel is a misnomer and crude oil is in fact a by product of geological processes that occur in the earths mantle and eventually bubbles up back into the crust where he find it as crude oil. If this proves to be true then crude oil is a renewable resource, and subsequently the primary argument of climate change advocates regarding sustainability is invalid.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "glenn Winn", "channel": "UC21MyqPJEY6aGrGa0S3WN2g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSEGKUdGXyu00YxCAjHfsRxzkcTpSbWJA5Mpw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Hence the Green politicians keep pushing this stuff.  \n\nIntermittency is one of the biggest problems, and the marketers claim that battery storage WILL solve the intermittency. However, the batteries in question do not yet exist, and nobody knows if they can be invented. That doesn't faze the wind marketers in the slightest, who go ahead and put a small battery on the Australian Grid and claim that Australia now has battery back-up for wind. Well, OK it does, but just not of any useful size. A propaganda stunt, no more no less. \n\nWe now have a situation where bids for ridiculously low strike prices have been taken to indicate that wind energy has become cheaper than coal. Yet, nobody has ever produced wind energy at those prices and stayed in business. Can the contract be fulfilled? It's these sorts of disinformation tactics which should ring alarm bells about this whole massively costly industry and the way it's squandering our chance of finding a real replacement for fossil fuels.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Ian Macdonald", "channel": "UC0vQg2vqLf85jh01wZBGctg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRWlJiQbmuaRSghBGgBHjl23C6uxFTcEbJadg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The left is in charge of the political and bureaucratic elites, the media, the universities, and Hollywood, so whether by design or it just happened that way, all the agencies in the government have been headed by leftists for a very long time. There is no balance, not when they manipulate the data collection. How do we really understand anything, the thermometer was not invented until the 1870s, was not widely distributed for a decade or two, and nobody ever started recording temperatures until two technological advances; the thermograph and radio, which liked to fill air time reporting the temperature, so they bought the thermographs. That was in the 1930s, so how do we know what happened before that? We don't, not with a degree of accuracy more than + or - 3 degrees. Three degrees would be disastrous, they say, but how do we know that? Yet with all the radio stations on the planet, we still only recorded temperatures on less than 1% of the surface, 40% of those were in the US. When did we start recording temperatures on the oceans? We still haven't done that, so 70% of the planet is ignored. So when did we start recording the surface temperatures with any degree of accuracy? 1979. Less than 40 years of data, and now they manipulate everything to fit some kind of political narrative. What are the limitations? 95% of the latent heat energy is stored in the oceans, and what does CO2 production by man have to do with that? Nothing. So what do we actually know right now, what can we take to the bank. Ocean levels are not rising at all, the parts of Miami where the surface is getting flooded were built on swamps, the ground is sinking naturally. So if we assume that the socialist idiots at the IPCC are right, the oceans will rise 2 100ths of an inch for the next 100 years. Rich people with homes on the beach might get their toes wet, the poor living in shacks on stilts only have 100 years to adapt. So explain the alarmism, when we can now accurately predict that the increase in CO2 is responsible for 6% greening of the planet. All plants and animals benefit from a warmer planet with more CO2, that is a provable fact, so get the damned lying politicians out of the science! I am comforted to know that that since the satellites have started collecting data, that the raw data shows no temperature change in the last 40 years. Their graphs showing anything else have been manipulated.

The data was right there, all the climate change zealots should have noticed, DUH! There has been no climate change, none, zip, nada, NONE! The climate is incredibly stable! Taken the raw data from satellites, which only go back 38 years, there has not been a single degree of change, and yet the margin of error is two degrees. Do you get that? NONE! We do not have global records going back any further, all that is interpolation with margins of error of more than 3 degrees! WAKE UP! Before satellites, we only recorded 1% of the surface temperatures going back to 1933, nothing before that! Why? We had no thermographs, no radio stations keeping records, and then there was all the political interference in the USSR because they manipulated that data so the gov't would give them more food and fuel to survive the harsher winters that they had reported. That was fully 25% of the data we collected up until the collapse of the USSR, 1989. So what does all the real data show? NOTHING! We have increased CO2 from 280 PPM in the 1930s until 380 ppm in 2000, but no increase lately. We have a 25 year pause when we only have records going back 38 years! So what is all this about? This is purely a hoax, gullible zealots who are afraid of a debate, wanting more control over your money, dictating everything we do, because just about everything requires energy. If they are so concerned, then why are they flying those jets around to so many meetings using up the same CO2 emissions as a thousand regular folks, or a million poor people! Remember, to restrict Carbon emissions, which is actually greening our planet, you are telling that poor person in India who hasn't eaten in three days that they cannot buy a tractor to plow the ground or run a pump to get clean water, or to use a refrigerator, which might save their life!

{"cid": "UgwtwKxqttp8KHyqUFB4AaABAg", "text": "How on earth can you say Global Warming is Climate Change?\nThey are two separate natural unstoppable disasters that will eventually happen. \nGlobal Warming happens after every ice age but, because we are still not out of our last ice age, it has not started yet.\nfor the last 10 yeas NASA as been taking photographs of the North Pole and has documented a 60% increase of ice. In the Plateau regions of the Antarctic it has not been warmer then -20 degrees Celsius and only on the coastal areas you may find 0 degrees Celsius or maybe even 1 or 2 degrees Celsius in the high summer time. In the dark ages it was possible to grow wine in most parts of the United Kingdom but, because of a temperature drop since the dark ages, this is no longer possible. Also if Global Warming would be happening and the Sea level is rising, why is this not noticeable at all Ports world wide? I am also sure that the first country who would vanish is the Netherlands and then the United Kingdom. If that is the case and this disaster is on its way, how come the financial industry is still giving out 30-40 year Mortgages to people in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands or North Germany or The southern part of the United States of America? Because its a scam and the Banks know it is. They know in 10 years time that very expensive house in Cornwall will still be there. In the 1970s most scientists said that in about 50 - 60 years time we should experience a small ice age created by the greenhouse effect. Now the main reason why the politicians of western Society are so keen on pushing for Global Warming is to slow down economic Growth in third world countries. Could you imagine what would happen to the western co-operations, the super companies like Nestle if India or Bolivia would be economically stable? This can not happen and they will do anything to stop it. One main way is to pay politicians to support their cause and create International Laws to stop third world countries from growing out of poverty. If any country would ignore the new laws passed through without their say so, we would simply intervene with military action in the name of freedom and to save the world after we use depleted uranium to destroy their army like in Iraq. Ok so maybe WWF have shown clips of large amounts of ice breaking away and they will continue that to get your money but, have you ever thought about how high must the North and South Pole must be if it constantly snows there and or its solid. Snow falls onto land and piles up. Pressure of that large amount starts to push the snow or ice out towards the coast. Saltwater and a slight higher temperature starts to melt the ice and WWF film this and sell it everyone as disastrous. I did not want to point fingers at WWF but, they are the first ones that came through my mind.  \n\nClimate Change is also a natural disaster that is not stoppable by mankind. This is caused by the Magnetic Field and the movement of the Magnetic North. As you may of heard before, our planet is surrounded by a Magnetic Field that protects us from a lot of harmful things like Ultra Violet Rays from the sun and radioactive cosmic dust to name two. Our atmosphere is approximately 550KM thick (does not just stop, it thins out) and consists of four layers during the day (D, E, F1 & F2) and only one layer at night. (D, E disappear and F1 & F2 merge together) There are three types of Norths we use and the first one is the True North. This is where Santa and his Elves make the Christmas Presents. The second one being the Grid North. This is used on a proper map where you have little squares that mark 1KM¬≤ or 2KM¬≤ and are called Grid Squares. You just cant put a Grid over something that is round, somewhere it would be off. Finally we have the Magnetic North and this one is moving from west to east. Anyone who can read a proper map knows about the GMA (Grid Magnetic Angle) and that if you want to walk on a bearing from a map, you need to add the GMA on to the Mils or Degrees of your compass. That Magnetic North moving and the South staying where it is, is causing the Magnetic Field in the north-western Hemisphere to stretch and in the east-western side to bunch up. The stretching of the Magnetic Field is causing it to weaken off and that is why there is a large increase of Hurricanes, Tornados and extreme Lightning Storms happening around the United States of America. We also have seen abnormal behavior within animals like Fish and Birds that rely on the Magnetic Field for navigation. Sooner or later we with have a change in the position of our planet and we then may experience todays climate in Italy, in Germany.  I am sure everyone knows that the Antarctic was not always covered in snow.\n\nNow what I will say is that we are responsible for a lot of bad things. We chop down our source of oxygen, we poison our oceans with plastic and our drinking water with chemicals and yes the Ozone Hole (in the E Layer of our atmosphere)  is us as well however, it has been shrinking. We are also responsible for our beaches disappearing but, that has nothing to do with water level rising, its more a thing about building things and needing sand to do so however, that‚Äôs a different topic.  So please relax and concentrate on the good things in life. Do something good, help someone in need and forget all this political bullcrap.

Thorium reactors nuclear waste is also harder to make into nuclear weapons, and mining thorium is safer and more environmentally friendly compared to uranium. Thorium can also be found abundantly around the world. Also thorium costs roughly 30$/KG vs uraniums 78$/KG. (Thorium is roughly as energy dense as uranium.)

Current research estimates the damages of climate change to be in the ten's or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per person until 2100. My point is that we should start decoupling fossil fuels from our society as fast as possible. Coal is currently so connected to society that we can't get rid of it overnight without causing chaos, but we should still start moving away from it to avoid and reduce the massive problems that climate change is going to cause if we don't act now while we still have the chance. In short we should start reducing the world carbon footprint with many methods including innovation and sensible legislation. We should see climate change as a problem to solve.

I think many scientists and alarmists behave the way they do because of exactly what you said, they are worried the public won't do anything. The real way to solve the problem is with economics, make photovoltaics and wind cheaper. When they become cheaper (which they will if we invest), then we can fix this climate problem which will damage us in the LONG term, but isn't necessarily doing huge damage at the moment.\n\nUnlike previous PragerU videos, this one spoke to me in a way that felt more fair.

A few points:\n\n\n1) Drop your CAGW straw man:\n\n\"Polluted Discourse: Communication and Myths in a Climate of Denial\n[...]\nAdditionally, we find that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a straw man used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50).\"\n\n\n\n2) Plenty of scientific sources has shown a transient climate sensitivity (TCS) or an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) greater than 3. For example, see:\n\n\"On a minimal model for estimating climate sensitivity\n[...]\n\n[...] the method of LS14 underestimates climate sensitivity by about 13%, correcting the estimates from the previous section, the credible intervals for transient climate response and equilibrium climate sensitivity are 1.292‚Äì2.937 and 2.330‚Äì5.338C respectively.\"\n\n\"Spread in model climate sensitivity traced to atmospheric convective mixing\n[...]\nThe mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.\"\n\n\n\n3) An ECS of 0.6C to 1C is outside the range supported by the vast majority of the scientific evidence. For example:\n\n\"Climate Sensitivity Uncertainty: When is Good News Bad? \n[...]\nDespite significant advances in climate science and increased confidence in the accuracy of the range itself, the ‚Äúlikely‚Äù range has been 1.5-4.5C for over three decades. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) narrowed it to 2-4.5C, only to reverse its decision in 2013, reinstating the prior range.\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's at the lowest levels in 600 million years.\n\nYou'll be happy to learn that manmade CO2 emissions have INCREASED global greening by 38% just since 1980 from the positive benefits of the CO2 fertilization effect:\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n8/full/nclimate3004.html\n\nGiven CO2's ACTUAL greenhouse effect the 120ppm increase has increased global temps by around 0.2C over the past 166 years... We've also enjoyed about 0.61C of beneficial warming recovery from natural factors since the end of the LITTLE ICE AGE in 1850..\n\nYou many want to check your math and your assumptions which are not based on reality....\n\nBTW, The reason Venus is hotter than the earth is because it is about 52 million miles closer to the sun AND because it doesn't have magnetic field....", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "CAGW Scam", "channel": "UCjIPcRPVhCh5DCrtd3Sun8Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSNEVvPnnPAvB4VfO8jJEiPxNLCulMgNaDxKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Low density fresh melt water stay on ocean surface and is freezing easier than salty seawater.\n\n2nd: When sea get's warmer there's more energy in system and it could lead to worse hurricanes. But it may also make coastal lines to block hurricanes from landing. But more energy in system may lead to worsening of climate related catastrophies like flash floods. My own opinion is that wavy jet stream may affect hurricanes, so they won't form so easily.\n\n3rd: Several species are under movement because of climate change.\n\n4th: All coral reefs are under threat. Like Great Barrier reef and around 25% death toll of it in 2016.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare\n\n5th: Mountain glaziers are going to be \"extinct\" globally. Like in US National Glazier Park is losing most of it Glaziers in few years. Glazier \"extinction\"  will lead droughts, because there's no meltwater during dry seasons. Like in Bolivia: https://woborders.wordpress.com/2016/12/05/bolivia-water-crisis/\n\n6th: These guys haven't seen what have happened in arctic in 2016. It has been crazy year in arctic and sea ice has declined badly. In some areas there was +20C temperature differences to \"normal\". And I'm not even starting to say what has happened to Methane hydrates with hundreds of 1km2 bubbling areas. \nJuly:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/climate-trends-continue-to-break-records\n\n7th: Polar Jet stream is not surrounding polar regions anymore. It has become so wavy in last few years. And this leads to extreme weather events more likely than before. This is 16 days forecast: http://www.netweather.tv/index.cgi?action=jetstream;sess= \n\n8th Since 80's I have been living in several places in Finland. And now coastal weather in Turku (one of the warmest places in Finland) has become same in inland Lahti, hardly any snow in Finland. Let's hope Skiing World Championships have enough snow. In 2000 or before there was always snow in this town, but not anymore. And these PragerU peoples says, it doesn't affect on wild life or don't worry about it...\n\n9th: This year is again warmest on record (ok, it's only 1 year, but 3rd year on row): \nhttp://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2017/2016-was-warmest-year-yet-ecmwf-data-show\n\n10th: Check what has happened in Alaska (10.6F anomaly, small area and 1 year, but hey change has been wild): \nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us/50/0/tavg/3/2/1895-2016?base_prd=true&firstbaseyear=1901&lastbaseyear=2000\n\nFor me this PragerU.com people are just total BS and they try to undermine several facts of global warming. Of course, if they have FACTS then I will listen (or read them to peer review them).  And PLS get facts from more than 1 site, and try to get one that are peer reviewed, don't even rely only to sites that I gave you.

{"cid": "UgiIErYl1aWDS3gCoAEC", "text": "Taking a moderate tone, or claiming that you're in a moderate position between extremists (ex: between alarmists on one side, and denialists), doesn't mean your position is rational or right. To say otherwise, is a fallacious argument to moderation. Sometimes, one side of the debate is right, the other side is wrong, and the middle position(s) are wrong as well. Period.\n\n\n\nAnyway, you lose credibility when you don't provide clear citations to the papers you're referencing, so people can read the papers for themselves and see if you're representing them accurately.\n\n\n\n\"But look at the U.S., where we have the best statistics: if we adjust for population and wealth, hurricane damage during the period of 1900-2013 actually decreased slightly.\"\n\nYou lose credibility when you make a claim that contradicts the published scientific literature, and you don't cite supporting evidence for your claim. In this case, that means side-stepping research showing increasing economic losses from hurricanes, even after controlling for socioeconomic factors:\n\n\"Economic losses from US hurricanes consistent with an influence from climate change\n[...]\nWe identify an upward trend in economic losses between 1900 and 2005 that cannot be explained by commonly used socioeconomic variables. Based on records of geophysical data, we identify an upward trend in both the number and intensity of hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin as well as in the number of loss-generating tropical cyclone records in the United States that is consistent with the smoothed global average rise in surface air temperature.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yet the trend for strong typhoons around the Philippines have actually declined since 1950, according to a study published in 2012 by the Journal of Climate.\"\n\nYou lose credibility when you don't take into account reviews of tropical cyclone activity, including research showing increasing maximum intensity for typhoons in multiple regions of the world:\n\n\"Tropical cyclones and climate change\n[...]\nFor example, a summary of trends in the lifetime maximum intensity of TCTCs [tropical cyclones] in various ocean basins is shown in Figure 1, for the period 1989‚Äì2009. Globally, there are modest significant trends in this quantity (at the 90% level), but individual basins have greater significance. In the North Atlantic and Western North Pacific, trends are highly significant at the 95% level, with increases in the North Atlantic and decreases in the Western North Pacific. More modest trends significant at the 90% level are seen in the South Pacific and the South Indian basins (both upwards). Trends have not been significant in the Eastern North Pacific and the North Indian basin has insufficient data.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, sea levels are rising, but the rise is not accelerating‚Äîif anything, two recent papers, one by Chinese scientists published in January 2014, and the other by U.S. scientists published in May 2013, have shown a small decline in the rate of sea-level increase.\"\n\nYou lose credibility when you get the time-frame of the acceleration wrong. The claim is not the rise accelerated in the past couple of years. That would be too small a sample size, and too prone to the effect of hard to control for stochastic control variables. That would make it difficult to get statistically significant results, as discussed in papers such as:\n\n\"Is the detection of accelerated sea level rise imminent?\"\n\"Timescales for detecting a significant acceleration in sea level rise\"\n\nInstead, the point is that the rise since about the late 20th century, is greater than it was before then. Furthermore, some areas of the globe experience more accelerated sea level rise than other regions of the globe:\n\n\"A 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise\"\n\"Hotspot of accelerated sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of North America\"\n\"An Anomalous Recent Acceleration of Global Sea Level Rise\"\n\nAlso remember that:\n1) global warming causes sea level rise [\"Global sea level linked to global temperature\"]\n2) there was global warming from about the 1970s to the present, with relative temperature stagnation (or slight global cooling) from the 1940s to the 1970s. [\"Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century\"]\n\nGiven these two points, you'd expect the rate of sea level rise to change in response to global warming patterns of the 20th century. And that's what we observe:\n\n\"Recent global sea level acceleration started over 200 years ago?\"\n\n\n\n\"But many climate-change alarmists seem to claim that all climate change is worse than expected. This ignores that much of the data is actually more encouraging than expected. [...] So let‚Äôs be clear. Climate change is not ‚Äúworse than we thought.‚Äù [...] But the narrative that the world‚Äôs climate is changing from bad to worse is unhelpful alarmism that prevents us from focusing on smart solutions.\"\n\nYou lose credibility when you fail to mention that climate change is often worse than the scientific experts expected. For example, the IPCC often under-estimates the effects of global warming, as opposed to exaggerating them. That runs contrary to the charge of \"alarmism\". Therefore, abusing the term \"alarmists\" also reduces your credibility:\n\n\"Climate Change Skepticism and Denial: An Introduction\n[...]\nA constant refrain coming from the denial campaign is that climate scientists are ‚Äúalarmists‚Äù who exaggerate the degree and threat of global warming to enhance their status, funding, and influence with policy makers. The contribution by William Freudenburg and Violetta Muselli provides an insightful empirical test of this charge and finds it to lack support.\"\n\n\"Reexamining Climate Change Debates: Scientific Disagreement or Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs)?\"\n\"Climate change prediction: Erring on the side of least drama?\"\n\"Global warming estimates, media expectations, and the asymmetry of scientific challenge\"\n\n\n\n\"If we want to help the world‚Äôs poor, who are the most threatened by natural disasters, it‚Äôs less about cutting carbon emissions than it is about pulling them out of poverty. The best way to see this is to look at the world‚Äôs deaths from natural disasters over time. In the Oxford University database for death rates from floods, extreme temperatures, droughts, and storms, the average in the first part of last century, was more than 130 dead every year per million people. Since then, the death rates have dropped 97 percent to a new low in the 2010s of less than 4 per million. The dramatic decline is mostly due to economic developments that help nations withstand catastrophes. If you‚Äôre rich like Florida, a major hurricane might cause plenty of damage to expensive buildings, but it kills few people and causes only a temporary dent in economic output. If a similar hurricane hits a poorer country like the Philippines or Guatemala, it kills many more people and can devastate the economy.\"\n\nYou lose credibility when you mislead people via faulty use of analogies. There are at least 2 distinct issues here:\n1) what caused a problem; can we stop that cause?\n2) how do you cope with a problem?\nThis roughly lines up with the distinction between mitigation (that's 1) and adaptation (that's 2).\n\nFor some natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, we have trouble stopping the cause of the disaster. Thus we don't really focus on 1. We instead focus on 2, where we try to cope with the damage from the disaster. That's where wealth comes in. So, for instance, your wealth won't prevent an earthquake, but it will allow you to buy a house that can better withstand earthquakes. So wealth helps with 2.\n\nNow, suppose we found a method to stop the cause of earthquakes. We would certainly be interested in pursuing that method. It would make no sense to object to this method by saying:\n\"it‚Äôs less about preventing earthquakes than it is about pulling people out of poverty\".\nThat's misguided; you should deal with the root cause of the problem, not just rely on people's wealth helping them cope with the problem. \n\nWe do the same thing for other issues like viral diseases; we try to deal with the root cause of the disease (that is\": the virus), instead of just giving people the wealth to help cope with the problem. If we can remove the problem (by removing the problem's root cause), then people won't need to spend money on the problem and they can instead spend their money on other things. Parallel points apply for climate change; deal with the root causes of climate change, as opposed to claiming that the issue is more about helping people get wealth.", "time": "4 years ago (edited)", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "134", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Example: suggesting co2 rising despite \"alarmism\" (proactive education and concern on the topic) is evidence for it not being effective is disingenuous. CO2 remained rising due to the enormous global infrastructure and corporate interests that would have continued regardless of messaging taken. When short term reductions of CO2 emissions will inevitably hurt profits, expect resistance. Yes, not every worst case prediction is coming true in exactly the way some have predicted. That doesn't mean the situation is not still incredibly urgent. The most important issue to understand is the strong correlation between CO2 and global temperatures over the last 300,000 years which has been remarkably predictive. That the last decade has seen CO2 levels reach new highs far greater than any in history is a serious cause for concern.

It implicated that when ice melts, it actually takes less space than the ice itself. That's something to check in the upcoming decades. \n\n- The costs of green power plants (i prefer it to say it that way, marketing is part of the world ;) ) Have gone down dramatically the last decade already. If you see the progress of solar panels these days, we went 20x more efficient than in 2005! The production costs are now way lower than then.  Wind turbines are starting to get somewhere now with TW mills. The problem is still the noise and shadow, but we're going somewhere now. Green is steamrolling and we just started!\n\n- We are now at a point that if we refinance ALL of our money invested and spent in fossil fuels (including nuclear) into green energy, we can actually be green in 2050. This and we even spare a TRILLION of Euro's with it. Of course it is not yet a card to play, but the possibility is there. More innovations in the next decade will make the grade for sure. \n\nStill, we are aware now some things have to change and the question is just: how? We agree on that.

{"cid": "Ugi0Y6I7BDGASHgCoAEC", "text": "The amount of antarctic sea ice is not an argument that global warming is slowing or not as bad as we thought. For one thing, the amount of decrease in the arctic is almost 3 times as much as the gain in the antarctic. For another thing, the growth of sea ice in the antarctic is due to cold winds blowing off the continent in the antarctic. There is no continent in the arctic. Also, there are record levels of water melting into the antarctic from the glaciers on the continent. That water is fresh water since it forms from snowfall, and thus freezes at a higher temperature than saltwater (since there are no glaciers at the arctic this isn't a factor there). Snow in the antarctic also causes increased ice formation by pushing ice underwater which protects the ice from melting (temperatures are higher closer to the surface).\n\nBecause of this last point the increased ice in the antarctic is a sign of increased warming. More snowfall is a sign of increased temperatures because warmer air holds more moisture.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Box Top", "channel": "UC1NeFwbS2zPXTPMLu_ky5rw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR7CoJvsuFaZXnzovFt2f6TMpMvq36mli194g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that a think tank that purely consists of economists and addresses in a kind of biased way on a economically beneficial level?\n-Melting graph: Antarctic rise in ice mass doesn't seem to compensate the decline in ice mass, which sucks. Also does melting ice not have as big as an effect on the global water volume compared to a rise of temperature (1 litre of warm water has a higher volume than 1 litre of cold water).\n-Rising sea levels: rate of rising sea levels isn't really an issue if the levels are still rising. The situation still sucks and its just a matter of more or less years until a lot of people will have some problems.\n-Drought have decreased, but desertification is still a present threat and one that doesn't seem to go away in the coming years. So the situation still sucks.\n-I'm very happy that worst and best scenario comparison was mentioned. This is important, we need to look at both scenarios and understand both of them.\n-Plotting hurricane damage with an adjustment to population and wealth looks like some disgusting utilitarianism to me. Of course the hurricane damage will decrease if the population and the wealth of a nation increases. One could have adjusted the graph to the amount of kittens in the US and one would have received the same result. A plot with the occurrence of hurricanes and their damage in total numbers adjusted to inflation would have made much more sense.\n-Getting people out of poverty is easier said than done. Although important, since then these people will have a higher chance to survive. But still, if we can not stop and reverse global desertification and the increase of global temperature, there will be a lot more of land that is uninhabitable. This leads to people loosing their place to live, to decrease in global stability and an increase in global poverty.\n-Other energy sources: The argument that the usage of solar and wind powered energy are \"expensive, feel-good measures that have as good as no effect\" is kind of a silly argument. Of course they don't really have an effect if we still pollute the crap out of our planet. We're only at the start. That's about as a stupid argument as a king in the middle ages saying: \"we don't need to invest in hand guns. the will have as good as no effect on winning a battle. They are just loud and heavy\". By investing in these kind of energy sources we are actually doing what this video says we should do about these kind of green energy sources.

Recycling is the environmentalist biggest lie. We are not reusing 100% of what we recycle and the amount of energy we use to recycle it is the reason the planet is going to die.\n¬† Think about it we spend 60 barrels of oil to build a car and 10 years latter we spend another 120 barrels of oil to recycle that car to build another.

It doesn't have 100 % efficiency, but it is far from what you say. If you'd need more resources (your 120 barrels of oil) to recycle than to produce from scratch, why would anyone ever recycled anything, it would be more expensive.\nRecycling isn't perfect, but it is far better than just dumping old and building new.\n\nAbout that \"using 1.5 Earhts\" It's a bit misleading. Main part of that index are CO2 emissions. According to the index, Earth has some capacity to get CO2 out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis and if we produce less CO2, than this capacity, CO2 levels won't be increasing. I don't think, this is relevant, because while living plant is scooping carbon from the atmosphere, dead plant is releasing it back again as it decomposes. Only plants that get burried really takes carbon out of the atmosphere (and in milions of years they turn into coal). So I don't think that there is a capacity for Earth to reduce CO2 levels. Well, there has to be, but it would be really miniscule. \nNotice, that this doesn't go against your arguement, it supports it by saying \"the number should be actually higher\"\n\nBut what what goes against your arguement \"The only way to solve climate change is reduction in consumption and population\" is this: cleaner technology. While it is true, that we use more natural resources this year than the last year. The rate of increase is going down as better technologies are implemented. Think is, that resource consumption is driven up mainly because of East Asia, India and South America. Those regions still have some population icrease (while Europe and North America already halted population increase) and they are getting richer and richer. With more money people consume more. Those countries are getting richer and pollute more, because they are not quite there yet to implement clean technology. Carbon footprint of Europe is in fact going down a little. India, China, Brazil, they will get there too. It will take about 50 more years and several flooded cities and several droughts before it will happen, but it most likely will. \nWe don't need really to reduce our consumption and if we needed to, I don't know how to convince mass of people to do that. People don't want to give away their luxuries.\nWhat we need is faster implementation of cleaner and cleaner technology and better recycling technology.\n\nAbout population growth and hostility of environment: less and less people dies because of natural catastrophes than 50 or 100 years ago. Well that is in this very video. Technology helps us thrive in worse environment and money well being drives our fertility down.\n\nAbout capitalism, it's just one of many systems of distributing wealth. I think it works quite well, but my question was: what system do you propose?\nAbout inequalities: all through human history, one percent of population had most of the wealth. Take ancient pharaos. They own everything, even the people themselves. It's just nowadays, there is so much wealth that this inequality gets even more pronounced.\n\nWhoa, that was long.

There are strait forward claims like sea level rise which has already condemned Florida and Delaware to nonexistence by the 22nd century. Temperatures rising and extreme events such as Texas floods or the Chines floods this year or droughts such as California drought. So I guess that #1 taken care of. Open your eye idiot.\nNow #2\n¬† We are cashing the check as we speak.Take a look at number #1 and do a little research, if you can.\n#3\nWrong, Wrong and wrong! all pollution stems from technology. So in your world I go to kill you but decide to only beat the shit out of you so things are getting better for you. As for your BS about starvation getting better I'm guessing that must be why we have so many refugee now. There so well fed and taken care of from technology they can't wait to move somewhere else.\n#4\n¬† Baby talk from a child. So because we know the cause we have to shut everything down. We could start with spreading the resources we have evenly so that no one starve and then we could stop producing useless garbage for the sake of the economy which is the reason we have this problem in the first place.\n#5\n¬†¬† We don't need technology you do.

When he doesn't get the results share holders want they change him.

Hence this video is misleading. 0:45 Two papers out of how many total? Important to note a study is not necessarily¬†a¬†discovery of facts, and that climate science is a question of probability. Secondly, a 'small decline in the rate of increase' does not imply the ocean level's no longer increasing! 0:57 Again the question regarding a lone study, but more importantly, is 30 years a long enough timeframe to identify a trend? Or is this a statistical anomaly (temporary trend) as generally expected from complicated systems? 1:23 \"We've gotten better at running away in time before our stuff gets destroyed!\" is a very poor argument to feel at ease. At this rate I likely won't finish the video, because it seems a waste of time to watch. 1:51 This appears to be a red herring: A local change in weather does not imply globally things aren't getting worse. Moreover, looking at this graph, one can draw a flatline through it: There's no clear improvement here, either. 2:05 I agree that being overly alarmist is bad (the media is doing this now to drum up ad revenue, and likely help rich people consolidate their power), but this video is even worse by misleading less scientifically educated people into thinking there's no risk at all, that it's all a hoax -- though that's not what he literally says after each argument, it's what he implies in his speech during each argument. 2:19 It seems to me to be a question of \"both/and\", not \"either/or\": We should cut emissions to mitigate the serious risk of catastrophe, and we should help people out of poverty. People do not need fossil fuel and deforestation to leave poverty: Richer nations can help them directly into the same sustainable technologies they are currently developing for themselves. It requires more personal sacrifice, however, i.e. Americans may need to live with less material wealth as some of it is redirected temporarily to help these poorer countries into sustainable ways of living (i.e. skipping the same problematic route of development that the now-developed nations took).", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "cloudsabove", "channel": "UCgU5_C0GoHWgZUHZskgXg2g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRro15MqKcoeB-aYeSnczsyLkr_paU5UdisWw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's already in the ocean, so it's the same water whether it's solid or liquid. The real question is what's happening to the glaciers. The glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica are melting at a rate far beyond what scientists predicted, causing massive amounts of very cold fresh water to flow into the Antarctic seas, where it freezes as more sea ice. the growth of sea ice in Antarctic is a warning, not a relief.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Claude", "channel": "UCNSib9SjWu1LNgbqdpW3LMQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTJGzhN_1j9ijN8Qva6i8gB1HDKEgwEqBD3HJ4W=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

His extensive and extensively documented[2],[3] errors and misrepresentations, which are aimed at a lay audience, \"follow a general pattern\"[2] of minimizing the need to cut carbon emissions.\n\n> Claims made by Lomborg in a November 2010 Op-Ed in the Washington Post[7] were subsequently debunked by the Climate Science Rapid Response Team, \"a scientist-run initiative to link top climate scientists with the media\".[8]\n\n> Geoengineering research proponent Ken Caldeira has said \"the vision of Lomborg‚Äôs Climate Consensus is ‚Äúa dystopic world out of a science fiction story... Geoengineering is not an alternative to carbon emissions reductions ... If emissions keep going up and up, and you use geoengineering as a way to deal with it, it‚Äôs pretty clear the endgame of that process is pretty ugly.‚Äù\"[9].\n\n> The extensive and uncritical acceptance of Lomborg's claims prompted a reaction from the scientific community. In January 2002 Scientific American's editor, John Rennie, wrote the preface to a ten page critique written by four specialists. Rennie commented that \"the errors described here, however, show that in its purpose of describing the real state of the world, the book is a failure\". [25]\n\n> The late Dr. Stephen Schneider, professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and Senior Fellow at the Institute for International Studies at Stanford University, criticised Lomborg for inaccurately portraying the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and misrepresenting the Kyoto Protocol. (Schneider is also editor of Climate Change and lead author of several of the IPCC chapters and the IPCC guidance paper on uncertainties).\n\n> Dr. Schneider also writes \"most scientists I know working on these problems are outraged by Lomborg's work and consider it to be faulty and misrepresentative of their published views. In addition to referencing a biased sample of literature that wasn't nearly broad enough, Lomborg used quotes out of context and proved numerous times that he did not fully understand the science behind climate change\"[26]\n\nhttp://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Bjorn_Lomborg", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "walter byrd", "channel": "UCw2-d70br-1qPK9gMm6CePQ", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSZ60p5OKI0C3TR5ITx-crDxzCSwkVCBZM8EstdUg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You proved precisely dick. Does it include possibility that scientists may cheat? Yes. Does that say that scientists are cheating. No. So unless you have real proof of deception, it's not a valid argument.\nNASA is funded by the government but that doesn't mean that Saturn is a leftist conspiracy.\n\nI kind of smiled a little bit when you said that you can look stuff without bias. It was generally funny.\n\nTo minimize variables in data you have to choose large enough time periods to average out, to remove small term cyclic or non variations. That's why individual years have no meaning, \"oh this year was colder than the previous so the Earth is cooling.\" No, it's not like that. You average these out and only major long term forcings are left. Now it's a lot easier to deal with less variables.\nThat way you don't have to account for every single thing or have perfect stability and you have accurate data (just over longer time period).\n\nHave you ever wondered. Do these people know something I don't? Listen to a scientists and go say to their faces that they are wrong. Explain your point of view. I'm sure you will be unpleasantly suprised.\n\nYou are free to believe whatever you want. That doesn't guarantee that what you believe is right.\n\nConsensus is what overwhelming majority of people think. These people are experts in their fields related to climate research.\n\nRemember when I talked about how individual years dont matter because they are affected by short term fluctuations? And how you said I can't make conclusions if dataset isn't stable? Now you mentioned Death Valley over at 1913 and asked where was man made warming then.\nYou damn hypocrite.

We know for a fact that there have been times in this planets history where CO2 levels were as much as 10x times more than they are now, yet there were no people around to have causes it.  The planet survived and recovered.  The ability of this planet to heal itself is never talked about from either side.

These commercials exaggerate the magnitude of global warming. They just help to promote the government in power and to improve its public image. \n\nSome of you may know that Ontario is the largest sub-nation debtor in the world due to rampant misspending and corruption in the provincial government. The Liberal Party of Ontario has been accepting many \"political donations\" from lots of green-energy companies, and in return the government \"rewards\" these companies subsidies. The provincial police has investigated and found that Ontario's green-energy sector is filled with corruption. The government subsides to wind power have gone miserably wrong, as these corrupt companies do not build good and reliable wind turbines. Taxpayer money is just wasted on giving subsidies to companies that bribed the government and these companies poorly construct wind turbines. \n\nOntario's education system is also flawed as it educates (kind of brainwashes actually) youth so much about that global warming is a massive issue, that it only provides a one-sided perspective, leading youth to to think that global warming is very severe. Every year we learn about climate change and global warming; so much that I don't know why we're still learning about it.\n\nI'm not saying that climate change or global warming is fake, I'm saying that we should stop exaggerating the issue, try to focus on the truth, and that politicians should stop taking advantage of this to get votes and bribes.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Brickfilm Man", "channel": "UCADrT4JIb5i5zP9WX1URrtg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRBOpOpRBEc58fQuqNWN0tu8NfAGgGsosI9ZZYJGA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Creativity and innovation will stagnate.\n\nSo yes, monopolies are, in almost all situations, at least somewhat bad for the economy.\n\nThe problem is Congress' ability to employ regulations to take down monopolies.

There are alternative sources of energy, they just aren't efficient relative to oil at the moment. If the costs for oil increase a lot, then the alternatives become more worthwhile. \n\nMedicine is indeed important, and the best way to reduce the possibility of a monopoly there is removing government barrier to entry.

The evidence is overwhelming.\nScientists usually reserve this level of agreement for claims like, \"Earth\nis a planet\" or \"air is real\". Yet here we are. The climate\nchange ship has left the dock, yet lots of people on shore are still debating\nwhether boats can actually float. But maybe you're a person that trusts and\naccepts what climate scientists are telling us. It's just... sometimes it's\nhard to explain why. I mean, we've all been there.\n\n‚ÄúI mean, I care about the environment. I figure with the\npolar bears and everything. We might as well try electric cars. What do we have\nto lose?‚Äù And then they go \"caps lock serious\" saying they have proof\nthat climate change is a hoax perpetuated by scientists paid off by the\n\"Polar Bear Lobby\" as part of a plan to install Al Gore's supreme\nworld polar bear emperor. Wake up 'sheeple!'\n\nTo keep that from happening, we put together this handy\nreference: The Science of Climate Change in 24 Easy Steps. (1) The sun is the\nsource of warmth on earth. So, thanks for that, sun. Ice and clouds reflect\nsome of its light away, but the rest is absorbed by land and water and\nre-emitted as heat. Some of that heat escapes to space and some is held in by\nthe Atmospheric Greenhouse Effect. (2) The insulating effect of earth's\nGreenhouse Gases are the reason the life exists as we know it, but (3) human\nactivities have increased the concentration of one of them, carbon dioxide, 40%\nsince the Industrial Revolution (1790).\n\n(4) We know the sun's output is varied during history, but\nsince the 1970s, the period when global temperatures increased the fastest,\ntemperature and solar activity have moved in opposite directions. (5) If the\nsun was to blame, it would cook the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere\ntogether. Instead, we only see warming in the lower layers. The same place that\nhuman greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are piling up. (6) Since 1870, with\nfossil fuels, cement production, and land-use combined, humans have put about\n2,000 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. That's two million million tons. And\nabout 40% has stayed there.\n\n(7) Studying gases trapped in ice cores has let us see what\nearth's atmosphere was like in the past. At more than 400 parts per million,\ntoday's carbon dioxide levels are the highest they've been for almost a million\nyears (190ppm - 800,000 years ago). That's before humans even existed. Totally\nuncharted territory for us. (8) More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means\naverage temperatures across the globe are increasing, and fast. Right now,\nearth is warming about 10 times faster than at the end of an ice age (today is\n+0.6C, end of ice age is +0.06C per 100 year span).\n\nOkay so, CO2 is increasing. How do we know it's our fault?\nThe best evidence comes from looking at what isotopes or different kinds of\ncarbon are in the atmosphere. (9) Fossil fuels come from mainly old plants.\nPlants prefer to use the lighter isotope, carbon 12, over the heavier, carbon\n13. So, they contain a higher ratio of 12 to 13 than the atmosphere does. When\nmore fossil fuels get burned, the percentage of carbon 12 in the atmosphere\nshould go up, and that's exactly what we see. (10) And it's not because of\nvolcanic activity. Volcanoes only emit about 1% as much CO2 as we do. (11) Normally,\nthat CO2 is balanced and exchanged between the atmosphere of plants and\nanimals, but eliminating carbon sinks has released centuries worth in just a\nfew years.\n\n(12) Other greenhouse gases are also increasing, like methane\nfrom farm animals and natural gas processing or nitrous oxide from fertilizers.\n(13) If we run simulations just using natural causes of Climate Change, they\npredict no change or even cooling in the 20th century, and that is not what's\nhappening. (14) It's still going to get cold in some places, but in the 2000s\nthere were twice as many record highs as record lows, and each of the past\nthree decades has been warmer than any other decade since we started measuring\nin 1850 (source: Royal Society / US National Academy of Sciences). \n\n(15) Since 1900, actual temperatures around the world have\nincreased almost a full degree and most of that has happened since the 1970s.\n(16) Looking at data from tree rings and ice cores, the past 30 years is\nprobably the warmest in eight centuries. Of course, not every place on earth\nwarms equally. (17) Oceans cover more than 70% of earth and they absorb more\nthan 90% of the heat added to the planet. Naturally, that's where we see the\nmost extreme changes.\n\n(18) Around the world, oceans are rising 1/10‚Äù per year, and\nthey're up 8 inches since 1901. (19) This is because water expands as it warms,\nand (20) when ice sheets melt in Greenland and Antarctica, water that's\nnormally on frozen land gets put in the ocean. (21) The oceans are earth's\nlargest carbon sink. As more CO2 enters the atmosphere, more of it dissolves in\nthe ocean, which makes the water more acidic (surface ocean pH from 9.0 to\n8.08, and surface ocean CO2 from 323 to 362 ppm between 1990 and\n2014). This doesn't mean the ocean's will be made of acid, (22) but animals\nwith calcium shells are super sensitive to pH. We're on course for the oceans\nto hit pH 7.8 in a hundred years, which could wipe out 1/3 of species in the\nocean.\n\n(23) We also know that levels of summer sea ice in the Artic\nhave decreased 40% since 1978. They might the lowest levels in 1400 years. (24)\nThat white sea ice usually reflects the sun's energy back into the atmosphere,\nbut the dark ocean is soaking it up like a black shirt on a sunny day, which\nfeeds the cycle forward.\n\nIf CO2 emissions continue on their current trends, earth is\non course to be two and a half to five degrees C warmer. The oceans could be up\nto a meter higher by the end of this century. Is that a big deal? Yeah! It's\nthe biggest deal. This is by far the greatest issue facing our species. The\nlast time the earth averaged a few degrees colder, most of North America was\ncovered in a mile thick sheet of ice. That many degrees warmer, we're gonna\nhave a bad time!\n\nSo, now you're armed with the facts. Why we know climate\nchange is happening and why we're causing it. Please, share this information\nwith the people you know, and then let me know: Did it change any minds? Did it\nchange your mind? Are facts enough?

Bummer, dude‚Ä¶\n\nWait, maybe you just don't understand how to do science! Here, I'll show you...\n\nHere's my belief: The scientific evidence for human-caused rapid-warming of the global climate system is unequivocal.\n¬†\nHere‚Äôs my evidence:\n\nSea level rise - Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century. The rate in the last decade, however, is nearly double that of the last century [1].\n\nGlobal temperature rise - All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880 [2]. Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years [3]. Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase [4].\n\nWarming oceans - The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969 [5].\n\nShrinking ice sheets - The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005.\n\nDeclining Arctic sea ice - Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades [6].\nGlacial retreat - Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world ‚Äî including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa [7].\n\nExtreme events - The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events [8].\n\nOcean acidification - Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent [9,10]. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year [11,12].\n\nDecreased snow cover - Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier [13].\n\nReferences\n1.¬†¬† Church, J.

I do not think you mean that there is an official percentage of \"Scientists believing in this\" right, every survey has different results. Which one is yours?\n\n\n\"Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch conducted a survey in August 2008 of 2058 climate scientists from 34 different countries.[121] A web link with a unique identifier was given to each respondent to eliminate multiple responses. A total of 373 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18.2%. No paper on climate change consensus based on this survey has been published yet (February 2010), but one on another subject has been published based on the survey.[122]\n\nThe survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections. There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public. Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.\n\nTo the question \"How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?\", 67.1% said they very much agreed, 26.7% agreed to some large extent, 6.2% said to they agreed to some small extent (2‚Äì4), none said they did not agree at all. To the question \"How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?\" the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all.\n\nA poll performed by Peter Doran and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at University of Illinois at Chicago received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. 76 out of 79 climatologists who \"listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change\" believed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Seventy-five of 77 believed that human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures have risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in significant human involvement\"\n\n\n\n\"How many of those 65.9% believe the effects of this warming are highly or even moderately negative?\"\n\nAssuming your percentage is the correct one (I highly suspect that is not the case seeming that many other surveys the percentages are much more inclined to the \"Yes\" part.\n\n\n\"That is less clear, but we're likely not even looking at a 50% consensus that climate change is significantly or even moderately negative.\"\n\n\nLikely?

Sorry but it isn't.  Your education and a teenagers education extends outside of the classroom.\n\nWhen teenagers are not in school for the summer as well as after school, teenagers should be working at least part time.  When a teenager is working in between his/her education, it does 3 things.\n\nFirst it keeps them out of trouble.  When a teenager is working after school he/she is not hanging out with losers and getting into trouble with drugs, alcohol, sex, and general mischief.\n\nSecondly, when a teenager works after school and during summer, it teaches them how to show up to work on time, how to behave around customers, and it also provides them the ability to learn what they want or don't want to do in life.\n\nThirdly, it helps teach the teenager the value of a dollar.  Many teenagers think that Socialism is wonderful because they don't understand how difficult it is for the average person to pay 42% of their earnings in taxation.\n\nJust because a teenager is working after school and during the summer, doesn't mean that their parents are not making enough money to take care of their kids.\n\nI worked during summers and after school and on weekends, and my parents had enough money to take care of me just fine.  But they had a policy if I wanted to buy something that was high dollar then I could work and buy it myself.  They would provide me with the basics like food and regular shoes, but if I wanted something extra or special, then I had to work for it.\n\nWhen I grew up during the 80s and 90s, I worked during summers and I bought my own mountain bike, high dollar shoes, and a used car.\n\nFor successful people, work and education do not stop at 5 pm and 3 pm.  Work and education starts when you wake up in the morning at 7 am and ends at 10 pm when you go to bed.\n\nMost of the time after about 10 or 20 years of busting your ass from 7 am to 10 pm, you are able to pull yourself out of poverty and join the middle to upper middle class and have plenty of disposable income.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Karozans", "channel": "UCJqV2fNtIDNr2HfFVCK9daw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRNF3TWE52NIsMWNucUsgZfP8TgXgVQfbppKSENFw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That socialism, indeed every subcategory of Marxism, is a scam. It is not a society of equals, nor was it ever meant to be. It is a society where a relatively small group of elites (public officials and their corporate cronies) rule over the equally poor. Every big government is wealthy and all the individuals that comprise that big government are wealthy and grow wealthier the bigger the government becomes. They do not reinvest the revenue they take in, they give back just enough to keep the natives from storming the palace and use the bulk for their own enrichment. See Venezuela right now. Chavez died a multi-billionaire while his people became poorer, and are now starving. Mixed economies like ours and in Europe, Canada, Australia, merely decline at a slower rate than full on socialist governments.

This leads to you lashing out against models. That won't work, since models are crucial to \"real science\". Models are how you generate hypotheses, make evidence-based predictions for future events, explain how things work and why they happen, etc.\n\nFor example, scientists have developed models for orbital mechanics. They've figured out which models work best (for example: they tested the models against experimental data), and they then use the models to predict the motion of satellites. Without these models, scientists couldn't make predictions about the future motion of satellites, and GPS-based technology would fail. Similarly, doctors and medical scientists develop models for how a drug works, how the drug causes the observed side-effects, etc. They then figure out which models work best (for example: they test the models against data generates in clinical trials, in vitro experiments, in vivo non-human animal studies, etc.), and they then use these models to predict whether the drug will work for a given patient.\n\nSo if you really think that \"real science\" doesn't use computer models, then have fun rejecting medicine, astronomy, physics, etc. as not being \"real science\".\n\n\n\n\"The arctic isn't melting, it's getting colder.\"\n\nYou're amazingly misinformed.

Within the scientific community, there were more predictions of imminent global warming than of imminent global cooling (let alone an imminent ice age). And you could hardly call this \"hysteria\", since the scientific community was careful to mention uncertainties that came with their conclusions:\n\n\"The myth of the 1970s global cooling scientific consensus\n[...]\nThere was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age. Indeed, the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then.\n[...]\nOne way to determine what scientists think is to ask them. This was actually done in 1977 following the severe 1976/77 winter in the eastern United States. \"Collectively,‚Äù the 24 eminent climatologists responding to the survey ‚Äútended to anticipate a slight global warming rather than a cooling‚Äù [...]. However, given that an opinion survey does not capture the full state of the science of the time, we conducted a rigorous literature review of the American Meteorological Society‚Äôs electronic archives as well as those of Nature and the scholarly journal archive Journal Storage (JSTOR).\n[...]\nThe survey identified only 7 articles indicating cooling compared to 44 indicating warming. Those seven cooling articles garnered just 12% of the citations.\"\n\n\"The idea of anthropogenic global climate change in the 20th century\n[...]\nThrough the 1970s journalists continued to indulge in sensational talk about the risk of abrupt cooling. In the public mind, the impact of human emissions got mixed up with an entirely separate scientific projection: some experts calculated that in the absence of human influences, orbital shifts in the natural course of the current ice age cycle would bring a gradual cooling over future millennia. In the 1970s, few scientists published peer-reviewed papers about any climate change faster than the thousands of years that glacial ages apparently took to evolve. Of those few papers, only a small fraction concluded that anthropogenic cooling was likely; others discussed cooling and warming factors without coming to a conclusion, and more than half thought it likely that greenhouse warming would eventually dominate. All the experts confessed, however, that this was guesswork; it would take decades of effort to work out a reliable answer. Journalists reported this confession, and the public well understood that no scientific consensus existed.\n[...]\nIn 1979 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences convened a panel, chaired by veteran meteorologist Jule Charney, to look into climate models. They found that any model capable of reproducing something vaguely like the present climate showed a rise in global temperature when its CO2 level was raised. The Charney panel announced they had rather high confidence that as the CO2 level doubled the planet would warm up by about three degrees, plus or minus 50% (i.e., 1.5‚Äì4.5C).\"\n\n\"Rebuttals to Climate Myths\n[...]\nHowever, the most comprehensive study in the 1970s was the 1975 report by the US National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council that concluded, \"‚Ä¶ we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines its course.\" This qualified statement is in strong contrast with the current position of the US National Academy of Science: ‚ÄúThe scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.\" To compare the handful of cooling predictions in the 1970s (predominantly from media sources, not peer-reviewed literature) to the current scientific consensus endorsing human-caused global warming, is both inappropriate and misleading.\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It doesn't matter.\"\n\nYou mean policies like the Montreal Protocol? Because I remember people going back to review whether that worked. Basically, there was an international treaty known as the \"Montreal Protocol\" that helped reduce anthropogenic release of CFCs. This helped slow down the decrease in ozone levels. See the following for further discussion:\n\n\"Quantifying the ozone and ultraviolet benefits already achieved by the Montreal Protocol\"\n\n\"Evidence for the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer\"\n\n\"Antarctic ozone loss in 1979‚Äì2010: first sign of ozone recovery\n[...]\nTherefore, our study suggests that Antarctic ozone shows a significant positive trend toward its recovery, and hence, leaves a clear signature of the successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol.\n[...]\nIt will take another fifty years to regain the 1980 level of ozone.\"\n\n\nOf course, it helped to have business interests support these regulatory policies. Parallel points may apply to addressing anthropogenic climate change, where the problem may be more easily resolved if business interests support the regulations. For further discussion, see:\n\n\"The ozone story: A model for addressing climate change?\n[...]\nThe ozone hole case suggests that nothing will likely happen until a dominant energy producer‚Äîor a consortium of dominant energy producers‚Äîdevelops profitable proprietary alternatives to fossil fuels and other greenhouse gas‚Äìemitting processes. Then, they will change positions to support regulations to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the purpose of giving themselves a competitive advantage and significant profits. Public awareness and energy conservation are important, and the public‚Äôs and government representatives‚Äô opinions can put pressure on corporate profits. But it really doesn‚Äôt matter what the public or government representatives want or believe; short-term and long-term corporate profits will drive any decision to greatly limit greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\n\n\n\"As to other kinds of skewing, do you believe that the dangling carrot of government grant money may play a role in how one might respond? Do you think that scientists are uniquely incorruptible?\"\n\nScientists don't just en masse make up conclusions to match their funding sources. Otherwise, most scientists would have stopped citing evidence of AGW under AGW denialist, politically conservative administrations; yet that didn't happen. And if AGW research was just a money-motivated conspiracy, then you would not expect such as broad scientific consensus to hold across scientists from different political/governmental systems; yet such a consensus did arise:\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\nNor would you expect the scientific consensus to be supported by multiple lines of evidence, including from evidence from non-government-funded studies, studies that were done before there was much of a political rationale for funding climate science research, and studies that lack a politically-motivated funding rationale; yet we do have such lines of evidence.\n\nFurthermore, you seem to have little understanding of how grant funding is awarded. It isn't awarded based on researchers guaranteeing that their research will support an accepted, pre-determined conclusion. In fact, the research that gets the most attention, prestigious prizes (ex: Nobel prizes), etc. is research that overturns accepted conclusions or breaks new ground, as opposed to just supporting the consensus position. Grant proposals may offer hypotheses to test, but the proposals typically leave open the possibility that the hypotheses will not be confirmed and instead a novel conclusion may be supported/\n\nAnyway, grant funding is awarded based on things such as the proposal writers previously publication record (to show that you can do published research, when given money), preliminary data presented in the proposal, how well the proposal writers know the field (as displayed in their grant proposal), whether the proposal writers have access to the equipment/tools needed for their proposed project, etc. You'd know this if you'd ever bothered to apply for a research grant, spoken with scientists who'd applied for such grants, looked up the grant proposal guidelines (which are freely available on the NIH website, NASA website, etc.), or spoken with grant reviewers. I've done all four of these. Yet instead of doing any of those four things, you seem to be just resorting to the sorts of baseless, paranoid conspiracy theories typical of denialists:\n\n\"HIV Denial in the Internet Era\n[...]\nDeniers argue that because scientists receive grant money, fame, and prestige as a result of their research, it is in their best interest to maintain the status quo [15]. This type of thinking is convenient for deniers as it allows them to choose which authorities to believe and which ones to dismiss as part of a grand conspiracy. In addition to being selective, their logic is also internally inconsistent.\"\n\n\"How the growth of denialism undermines public health\n[...]\nCharacteristics of denialism\nIdentification of conspiracies: Denialists argue that scientific consensus arises not as a result of independent researchers converging on the same view but instead because researchers have engaged in a complex and secretive conspiracy. They are depicted as using the peer review process to suppress dissent rather than fulfil its legitimate role of excluding work that is devoid of evidence or logical thought.\"", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Atomsk's Sanakan", "channel": "UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuaJRMOjhGUARgljAuXZFBKR6u-Qiys87pGnwF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

My goodness, you might as well trust a tobacco-industry-funded journalist on how smoking is healthy.\n\nAnyway, the study in question doesn't show what Taylor claims it shows. The study was not looking at geoscientists in general, nor does it show most of them don't think that anthropogenic climate change is real. The study was instead largely looking at scientists working for the fossil fuel industry; do you really expect those folks to be unbiased? Taylor misrepresented the study so badly, that the study's authors came out and corrected him:\n\n\"First and foremost, our study is not a representative survey. Although our data set is large and diverse enough for our research questions, it cannot be used for generalizations such as ‚Äúrespondents believe ‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúscientists don‚Äôt believe ‚Ä¶‚Äù Our research reconstructs the frames the members of a professional association hold about the issue and the argumentative patterns and legitimation strategies these professionals use when articulating their assumptions. Our research does not investigate the distribution of these frames and, thus, does not allow for any conclusions in this direction. We do point this out several times in the paper, and it is important to highlight it again.\nIn addition, even within the confines of our non-representative data set, the interpretation that a majority of the respondents believe that nature is the primary cause of global warming is simply not correct. To the contrary: the majority believes that humans do have their hands in climate change, even if many of them believe that humans are not the only cause.\"\nhttp://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2013/02/15/denialism-from-forbes-courtesy-of-heartland-hack-james-taylor/\n\nThis is the study in question:\n\"Science or Science Fiction? Professionals‚Äô Discursive Construction of Climate Change\"\n\nPlease try actually reading the study, as opposed to relying on what Taylor and his fellow denialists say about the study. Or at least listen to what the study's author say about the paper.\n\nWhen you actually looked at a broader picture of the scientific community, the scientific consensus in quite robust, as shown in:\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\n\n\n\"The '97%' consensus is a myth and always has been a deception. That number comes from a survey of members of East Anglia - the sample was only 79 scientists, and 76 of them agreed with the man made global warming theory. So if you're concerned about sample size, look to your own side's first and foremost.\"\n\nThere were at least 3 studies showing the 97% figure; so please don't act as if we're limited to just the sample size from the Doran and Zimmerman paper. These issues are further discussed in (especially table 1):\n\n\"Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming\"\n\n\nFurthermore, Doran and Zimmerman had a very good reason for focusing on those 70+ scientists: those were the scientists with the most expertise in the topic. Basically, Doran and Zimmerman wanted to focus on the scientists with the most expertise is climate science, since those scientists were the most likely to have accurate views on climate science. This makes sense both in climate science and other scientific/medical topics. For example, who are you more likely to trust on cancer: someone with just a B.S. in biology who's never done research in cancer, or an MD/PhD oncologist with a long publication record in cancer research? The answer should be obvious. \n\nNote that having an advanced degree in a subject (ex: PhD) and having an extensive publication records in that subject, are both pretty goody proxy measures for being an expert in that field. that's why for example, funding organizations look at someone's publication record in a field when figuring out whether to award them grant funding in said field. That's why so many studies on consensus use publication record and/or advanced degrees in the topic as proxy measures of expertise.\n\nDoran and Zimmerman make these points quite clear in their paper. Of course, you leave this out, so that you can pretend they have no justification for focusing on those 70+ scientists. Quite unfair of you:\n\n\"Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change\n[...]\nIn our survey, the most specialized and knowledgeable respondents (with regard to climate change) are those who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change (79 individuals in total). Of these specialists, 96.2% (76 of 79) answered ‚Äúrisen‚Äù to question 1 and 97.4% (75 of 77) answered yes to question 2.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is only one example of many. Indeed, there is a very long standing online petition of highly credentialed men and women of science comprised of 30 thousand signatories.\"\n\nThat petition (the Oregon Petition) is nonsense, as discussed in the following source:\n\n\"Science Denialism: Evolution and Climate Change\n[...]\nNote that the wording refers only to ‚Äúcatastrophic heating of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere,‚Äù yet signers of this petition are often represented as questioning the reality of any greenhouse warming.\nThe marketing of this petition was clever and deceptive.\n[...]\nThere was no effort to determine which of them were active research scientists and no way for outsiders to check the authenticity of the names.

Humans have been around for 0.004% of that time.\n\nThe Holocene interglacial of the current Ice Age has had 10 warm periods. To say that 9 were natural and the last one was purely caused by human is kind of fishy. Those 10 warm periods happened roughly once every 1,000 years. To think that we would not have had a warm period, without humans, after 9 others went off like clockwork, is not very logical. In other words, nature had more to do with our modern warm period than humans. If you look at the graph of CO2 increases on the year to century scale, there is very little correlation between temperature and CO2.\n\nNow, this notion that Global Warming is bad is all wrong.

This was an indication that the temperature warmed up earlier in the year.\n\nIn Africa, a study of the glaciers shows the temperature change due to the change in the ratio of two isotopes of carbon.

Part of it is the public concern. When something goes wrong at a fission plant, it's very messy (Chernobyl serving as an extreme example. While Fukushima is still being cleaned up, it was much less bad.) so nukes aren't popular even when they are considerably cheaper and safer than the alternatives. There's a lot of NIMBYing out there regarding fusion.\n\nFusion reactors are dreamy by comparison. A disaster just shuts it off. You need common hydrogen, not very-rare uranium or plutonium. There's no waste that needs to be buried (as per fission) or sequestered / blown off into the air (coal or oil). And we've made fusion reactors before, they're just not sustainable as they produce less energy than is used to drive them.\n\nITER is supposed to change all that, and they're pretty confident it'll work this time, which is one of the reasons they changed its name from experimental to energy.

{"cid": "UgiVhYpG3pNX3ngCoAEC.8Gs4iNA5kkJ8SZUkMSW_l2", "text": "We are by putting fluoride into the water Professor Genius Judi. You cannot get rid of it through steam distillation. Carbon levels are lower than they have been historically on average for the last 800,000 years. Understanding this, are you trying to tell me humans can somehow be harming the planet by putting out a normal gas necessary for all life that is actually in a huge shortage statistically speaking? CO2 makes up less than 2% of the atmosphere and plants love CO2. They grow faster and stronger with CO2 which means we could have stronger and more resilient forests. I suppose just believing what you are brainwashed into beLIEving is easier though. Never bothering to look at facts. I suppose you also want Rothschilds Dynasty to grow even richer and more influential by forcing everyone to so called \"green\" energy. You know he owns nearly all uranium deposits and that mining it pollutes under ground aquifers that supply water to nearly half the Country. If you count the world, it is far higher. Every time we talk about nuclear fuel, we are talking about increasing the cancer rate for everyone which will definitely help people pilfering from the socialist health care system stay rich and keep the costs of health care to sky rocket simply because of how expensive and unsuccessful fighting most uranium induced cancer is. \n\nYou are painfully ignorant of the entire landscape of available information. You are thinking like a compartmentalized cell that does not understand the workings of all the neighboring cells that make up the entire organism. Do yourself a favor and never stop learning. Seek it out every chance you get and find all opposing evidence and arguments no matter how obscure or hard they are for you to find. Also find out where the money is coming from to fund any scientific agenda as there is likely a money trail funneled through tax free foundations and universities that always supports agenda 21 and the Rothschild Secret societies Doctrines that lead to totalitarian one world Nazi-communist government domination.  \n\nYou want to look up club of Rome 1973, Counsel of Foreign Relations, Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, New World Order Fulfilling Prophecy or a 6000 year world history by holder of 2 Masters Degrees in History, Leonard Ulrich. You want to look up Who created the secret societies and what they teach at the highest levels. It all leads back to Rothschild's and a small group of Oligarch's whom have colluded with think tanks and secret societies and any religion of influence to slowly but surely take over the world while keeping us all poor through a banker created system called by any one of these synonyms,  \"Feudalism/Communism/Stalinism/MaoTseTung-ism/Nazism/Socialism/Marxism/Castro-ism/EmperorPolPot-Ism/Communalism\" which the bankers designed to keep you poor and themselves rich thus protecting the status quo and cementing their eternal power over you the slaves of this Police state society with no rights, liberties or protections. \n\nThe Oligarchy has used secret societies to divide and conquer by ensuring all religions never have the ability to rise to the same level of power as the Vatican, the Khazar Zionists, and the FreeMasons that follow what is known as Luciferian Illuminism which has either been created or hijacked by the Rothschild's and the few Colluding Oligarchs families to covertly take over the world. Technology is at a point where the technocracy is almost ready to fully deindustrialize the world and switch to automation, Kill off the worlds population gradually by, attacking the cheap and abundant energy supplies like coal, Massive wide scale GMO takeover of all the worlds food supply  that lower fertility by around 10-15% each successive generation fed mostly GMO foods, vaccinations that selectively cull specific races or damage one race more than another, geoengineering, where by heavy metals alter the PH of the top soil and weaken the barks of trees and helps make non-GMO tress less resilient and prone to infection and death. It also pollutes the air, water, soil and food with micronized Aluminum which increases Allergies and causes Alzheimer's!  If energy is too expensive to produce from things like green energy, then people will die from cold exposure in the winter and heat exposure in the summer if they are poor like what happens under communism. There is so much you have no idea about simply because of controlled information, indoctrination and cognitive dissonance when you are confronted with anything that goes against what you already BeLIEve. \n\nOnce the controlling Financial Elite Oligarchy has the right technology and a population under 500,000,000 people, they can lord this technology over us as sovereigns and destroy all the technology we have or take it by force. They are already attacking our ability to defend ourselves with guns  and our rights to free speech and our rights to privacy and our rights to a speedy and fair trial. We have lost rights to warrant-less searches. We have police for profit committing theft of honest citizens and calling it civil asset forfeiture. We can be held indefinitely without charge now for something as minor as Jaywalking if the leaders wish it. Everything we say and do is spied on and recorded in private servers of the CIA, NSA, FBI, Google< Microsoft, and Facebook. Facebook censors what you can say and whom can see your posts now because they are working towards socialist/communist dictatorial fascism. You can post something but no one will see it if you are flagged. They can even ban you for using any word they deep hate speech unless you are talking about harming white people.  If you commit a misdemeanor now thanks to Obama's law you can be held as and considered legally a terrorist!  If you support any of the mass genocide being carried out or that has been carried out by these communist people, then you are the enemy of freedom and of humanity however, I will still defend your right to say such terribly ignorant and misinformed information to the death because I know just how precious and rare the liberties and freedoms we have really are.
