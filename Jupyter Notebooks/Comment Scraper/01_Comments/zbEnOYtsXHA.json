He goes on expeditions with scientists uncovering the reality of climate change and meets with political leaders fighting against inaction. He also discovers a calculated disinformation campaign orchestrated by powerful special interests working to confuse the public about the urgency of the growing climate crisis. With unprecedented access to thought leaders around the world, DiCaprio searches for hope in a rising tide of catastrophic news.\nFrom Academy Award¬Æ-winning filmmaker Fisher Stevens and Academy Award¬Æ-winning actor, environmental activist and U.N. Messenger of Peace Leonardo DiCaprio,¬†Before the Flood¬†presents a riveting account of the dramatic changes now occurring around the world due to climate change, as well as the actions we as individuals and as a society can take to prevent the disruption of life on our planet. Beyond the steps we can take as individuals, the film urges viewers to push their elected officials in supporting the use of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power. ‚ÄúWe need everyone to demand bold action from their political leaders and to elect representatives who have their best interests at heart, not the interests of corporations to perpetuate a cycle of greed and destruction,‚Äù says DiCaprio. ‚ÄúThis documentary shows how interconnected the fate of all humanity is ‚Äî but also the power we all possess as individuals to build a better future for our planet.\"\nhttps://www.beforetheflood.com", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "MrJosh32145", "channel": "UC0Wf-frZgBRF1lIXpuO7HqQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRq9MVb7PR97DK1ayShY9q19V6t15d_ZhxOFw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The description of the SAGD process was edited, also the chinook that randomly passes over Alberta which caused the snow to melt during the shoot of the movie he was working on. Instead of flying 200+ people and film gear to Peru. They could of simply went a few hours west and found exactly what they were looking for. So yah, Leo is just as bad if not worse than most when it comes to consuming energy. Which he does admit to in this movie.\n\nI actually attended a dinner with Marc at the Saw Ridge Inn one time. Really nice guy, rather clueless as to what goes on though. His description of the SAGD process is way off and how things are actually connected are not correctly portrayed... He really has no idea what is going on at Suncor and doesn't care. Just collecting a pay check like all those guys do.\n\nTo be quite honest, if they did a real investigative doc on that area they would find it is quite a bit more disgusting then portrayed in this short bit in the film. Every doc I have ever seen about the oil sands really don't tell the honest truth about what happens there at all.\n\nI was in Fort Mc Murray when Leo was there. He was there for three days. He hung out at the casino, then flew north to on a chartered Phoenix Heli-flight helicopter to Fort Chipiwan after buzzing around the mining operations, met some band leaders there, got a leather jacket and left, all with an entourage of people.\n\nThe parts with the video, where they had shown the flaming water. That is a natural occurrence and was debunked many times. This had nothing to do with fracking. I am not sure why they had shown those clips instead of showing what actually happens when fracking fails... \n\nI guess the point of the movie was made.

{"cid": "UgwqMDiM9OjHvrcCLFh4AaABAg", "text": "If you have to watch this for school hope this helps... I would recommend watching this movie in segments since it is pretty long and there are many questions. Even if you don't want to watch it, you should if you have time.\n\nBefore the Flood ‚Äì Lab Questions\r\nWatch this documentary and answer the questions:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbEnOYtsXHA&t=4s\r\n\r\n1.  Do you believe the climate is warming? If so, are humans speeding it up, why or why not?\r\nI am a firm believer of the effects of climate change on our Earth and how these changes are catalyzed by carbon emissions, greenhouse gasses, unsustainable products, etc. Humans are only speeding up this process, because some people are not educated in this issue or simply do not believe the scientific proof of climate change. From big corporations that rely on fossil fuels to people who throw their plastic bags on the ground humans continue to speed up the process of global deterioration. How long can we last until these damages become irreversible? What will it take for people to listen and change their habits to strive for a change at surviving in the future?\r\n\r\n2. What is climate change?\r\nClimate change is the rise in temperature in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere due to human activity and greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change can be most attributed to the excess of carbon emissions which continue to thin the ozone layer which makes up Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Without this ozone layer human life would cease to exist and there would be no protection from the powerful rays of the sun and no oxygen. \r\n\r\n3. What are the causes of climate change?\r\nSome causes of climate change in the earth include fossil fuels, oil, and coal, which are nonrenewable sources being mined and harvested increasing the rate of release of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane. Fracking, destroying mountaintops, offshore drilling, and cutting down forests also contributes to the causes of climate change. Furthermore, population increase causes overall climate change because there is a larger emission of greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\n4. What are the consequences of climate change? \r\nDangerous weather patterns, floods, fires, and rising sea levels are just some of the consequences of climate change that may become irreversible over time if something is not done about it. In places such as Beijing, the air quality is so poor that it makes some people worried about their personal health and have even started wearing masks outside because it hurts some peoples‚Äô lungs. Due to the increase of the earth‚Äôs atmosphere, if all of the ice melts in the Arctic Ocean it will drastically change currents, flood patterns, and weather. By 2040, there is predicted to be no ice and people are going to be able to sail across the Artic Ocean.\r\n5. Are we currently seeing the effects of climate change in the US? If so, where and what is occurring?\r\nJust this year, there have been massive fires in Colorado, California, and Oregon which are also due to the dryness and increase in the risk of brush fires. In Hawaii the coral reefs are dying off and there are not many vibrant reefs or fish populations as there were decades or centuries ago.\r\n\r\n6. Why was Leonardo DiCaprio chosen as a spokesman for climate change with the United Nations and should he be? \r\nAs the United Nations Messenger of Peace Leonardo DiCaprio feels honored to have been chosen but expresses pessimistic views of the future. At a young age he grew up in downtown LA and enjoyed going to history museums and learning about extinct species that were wiped out by settlers further decimating the ecosystem. The difference today is that people are knowingly doing this on a much larger scale\r\n\r\n7. Why is climate change a politically charged issue in the US?\r\nThe effects of climate change are slow and steadily getting more dangerous so many people do not see this topic as an immediate issue that needs to be dealt with right away.  Furthermore, there are those who believe that this issue is a hoax and not real. \r\n\r\n8. Should climate change be a politically charged issue in the US, why or why not?\r\nNo. Let me ask you this‚Ä¶Should sleeping be a politically charged issue? No, right because sleep is a part of survival. Humans need a certain number of hours of sleep per night to function properly similar to how our Earth needs certain environmental conditions to function and continue to be livable. Humans cannot survive without sleep similar to how the earth cannot survive if it is being drilled into and taken apart day by day. Climate change should also not be a political issue because it is an irrefutable fact based on credible scientific research. If you do not want to believe the scientific evidence step outside a take and take a breath do you smell smoke? What about any fires in the distance or ash falling from the sky? I have seen these post-apocalyptic looking scenes myself just outside my window. If I were to encounter someone who believes climate change is real or should be a political issue, I would tell them to talk to the people who live around the Amazon forest. Talk to the parents in Beijing worried about their health. Talk to the families in Kiribati, where the rising sea levels threaten their livelihood.\r\n\r\n9. Why do ~131 members of Congress deny that the climate is warming?\r\nAmong the members of the Congress there are people who are misinformed or refuse to believe the effects of climate change happening in real time. The increase of temperature has been quite sudden and not steadily increasing over time. This spike in temperature makes some believes that climate change is not something that has been a problem in the past. There are also some who benefit from nonrenewable energy resources and see the science of climate change as bad for business. Senator James Inhoffe is the largest recipient of fossil fuel money and advocates for climate change blocking bills.\r\n\r\n10. Should the US be a leader in combating climate change, why or why not? \r\nThe United States is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses. Collaboration with other populated countries such as China may increase changes for climate change. China has surpassed the US in pollution and population because China is a large manufacturer. In China, technology on maps and databases track the violations of manufacturing sites to put them under the public eye and not in the dark. This way manufactures need to be mindful of their emissions and are not able to operate in secrecy. \r\n\r\n11. How do oceans and forests naturally combat climate change?\r\nBoth forests and oceans absorb a third of the world‚Äôs carbon dioxide intake in the atmosphere. Forest store CO2 in their leaves and trunks, and when trees are lighted on fire it is like setting off a carbon bomb releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The environment acts as a stabilizing force, but the oceans and forests cannot do their jobs fast enough because CO2 is produced at such a high rate. \r\n\r\n12. What is palm oil and why is it contributing to climate change? \r\nSoutheast Asian rainforests in Indonesia set fires intentionally set to create palm oil plantations which is the cheapest vegetable oil in the world. This cheap commodity is making companies big profit. Palm oil plantations cover 80% of forests, and forest fires released more carbon dioxide than the US daily in 2015. Due to deforestation tigers, orangutan, and elephants lost their habitats with the forest fires\r\n\r\n13. What is a greenhouse gas and which one is the most potent?\r\nThe most potent greenhouse gas is methane. Cows produce methane more than any other animal. 47% of land in US is used to grow cattle. This is problematic because 1 molecule of methane =23 molecules of CO2.  \r\n\r\n14. What is a carbon tax and should we implement one?\r\nThe carbon tax is a tax put on any activities that expel carbon emissions. This means that with the price on carbon going up then less people would consume the product and less would be put back into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\n15. What is the Paris Climate agreement, and should the US have pulled out?\r\nTwo of the world‚Äôs largest economies and emitters, the U.S. and China, creates momentum of change towards climate change. World leaders of 195 countries come together to return to a stable planet during the signing of the Paris Climate Summit. This conference explores the changes and solutions that can be implemented to decrease the negative effects of climate change. The goals is to keep climate warming below 2 degrees Celsius.\r\n\r\n16. What are some sources of renewable energy?\r\nWind and solar energy are examples of renewable sources of energy because they will never run out unlike fossil fuels. Wind turbines are installed where there is the most wind on mountains or in the ocean coasts which provide energy the more the turbines rotate. Solar energy in the form of solar panels harness the energy from the sun to power homes or part of the electricity used in some places. \r\n\r\n17. How would you explain climate change to your uncle? \r\nI would explain climate change in simple terms such as this‚Ä¶ climate change is the increase of the temperature around us due to the use of energy sources that will eventually run out. Multi-billion-dollar companies do not want to lose their money, so they do not want to believe in the effects of climate change. This issue affects the air we breathe, the crops we grow, inhabited islands, etc. This is a serious issue, because we may reach a tipping point soon where weather patterns may become more severe and damage to our earth becomes irreversible. Change needs to happen now before it‚Äôs too late.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Briane Souki", "channel": "UCbvnf1rQpLakUzzNlIaU1cA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSy176PBNyy6dTYMwd805fz6pGh1HfvPfyp80YgFA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I don't believe really that the countries and politicians will do what they have signed.\nWe must be active to point them in the right direction.\n\nEven long time ago It was enough for the fossil energy companies to further make money and to corrupt the politics.\nWe must show them everyday, that we are definitely NOT using or needing their products.\n\nI was a in love with cars, I have moddified like an idiot, cause I am a mechanic.\nBUT.....I even have no car anymore. I sold my last car 12 years ago and never drove or bought a new one.\nEspecially the SUV's with tons of HP and hilarious mass, no normal human does need such a dumb thing in his life.\nMy grandpa has lived well with a donkey^^. He was a little farmer, and need a donkey just for tranporting goods.\nHE WAS HAPPY. AND SO I DID. I miss that old life.\nEven when we all quit driving cars, our climate has a chance to rebuild.\nFurther we must quit some unnessessary luxury. Whom you wanna impress ???\nEverybody knows where we are coming from. We aren't all coming from king families.\nEvery baby is born naked and the same way. Why we have to show that our car or something else is more powerfull and bigger than others.\nIt doesn't matter.\n\nWe must quit buying thing JUST to impress others first.\nThat is highly capitalistic. And that is FUEL for the companies. They won't quit till the last tree has fallen.\nBut they quit definite, when they have no sale.\nThink about it.\n\nSir Leonardo Di Caprio has shown everything perfectly and with calling the solution.\nSo now it's our turn, because the politicians etc. won't start anything new by their own.\nThey need our directive.\nSo c'mon, let's do it for our kids, that they could have a future.\n\nSorry for my bad english, I am from germany.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "Paralytic Angel", "channel": "UCobK6Kznm9B1S4060_50oJA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlzzOjZE_vhHW2z3c9k5nQB3MORY9pqOoqC6g_dA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The people are nice and conceited at the same time. For example the gun laws, when they say \"its your right\" and as a European you know guns are very dangerous and then there are school shootings and people say yeah but we need our guns, that doesn't make sense to us. So many of us think that the people in the US are very focused on their opinion and sometimes we think you're very dumb (or some of your folks) for example this extrem patriotism or storming the capitol like tf. \nBut I think there are many people in the US, that are just normal guys not completely arrogant and egoistic and many bad things come from the politicans...\nIn case of the topic climate change I think there are few people that see the problem in it and that's kinda sad and I see a lot of people that think no climate change is not a problem (like mentioned in the movie) but in average you can say that there are \"bad sheeps\" in every country that deny everything.\n\nBUT hate and egoism don't help us to solve problems, so I can't blame the whole US or all of its citizens, despite the fact you hear many bad and hilarious story's from the US.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "Friedrich der Gro√üe", "channel": "UCxF8Z2lG2JUxVWnvQTW-ZJw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ9v0KpQ6tEoESgUvEQ1cnc5Z6TfJtCKbdgRe_VIw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwKcfheWrCNnes6D2p4AaABAg", "text": "Anyone doing this for school here are the answers for that old ass looking worksheet. dont clock me if these are wrong it took me so damn long\n1. DiCaprio feels honoured that he has been given the title of UN Messenger of Peace \r\n2. Before, he would read about how hunters would wipe out entire species and ruin ecosystems and how angry that made him. Now, we are doing this knowingly on a much larger scale.\r\n3. The energy sources that power most of our electricity and transportation are the fossil fuels: coal, oil, natural gas. There are many new ways of extracting these resources that are extremely destructive, such as mountaintop removal for coal, fracking for natural gas, offshore drilling for oil and the tar sands. As a result of these harmful methods, forests are cleared out which destroys habitats, water and air are polluted. It affects wildlife and native communities as well.\r\n4. There used to be a plentiful amount of ice that was hard and blue that melted very slowly. Now the ice is white and melts quickly, so there is less of it.\r\n5. The entire state of Florida could be wiped away due to rising sea levels. The Mayor of Miami has implemented pumps all around the city as well as raised the roads to combat rising sea levels. It is a 100 million dollar project and it will take a significant amount of time, around 40-50 years.\r\n6. There have been protests in China to make power plants more transparent to the public by revealing their monitoring data every hour. This is so that the people of China can hold those in charge of these emissions accountable for their actions. There is currently a national pollution map database that shows all the major factories in China, 9000 of them, most of which are not in compliance with the standards. China has also begun in switching to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n7. The people of India are suffering with massive power shortages and blackouts. 300 million people in India are living without power or any light. Many families have been forced to use cow dung or biofuel, a form of renewable energy and wonder why other countries cannot do the same.\r\n8. The United States of America is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in history.\r\n9. Over one billion people are living without electricity.\r\n10. In the last 30 years, 50% of coral has been lost\r\n11. Forest fires release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.\r\n12. Cows release methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.\r\n13. It would be difficult to build 100 Gigafactories because they are enormous; up to 15 million square feet. Tesla is the only company as of now that uses a Gigafactory and it would require other companies to contribute to this transition as well.\r\n14. The carbon tax is a basic attack or punishment for any activity that releases carbon into the air so that people consume less of it. I think that the carbon tax is a great idea in theory, but it can lead to ignorance.  Many people still do not believe that climate change is a problem and the carbon tax is an excuse or conspiracy to get citizens to give the government more money.\r\n15. Obama was not able to mention a carbon tax during his campaign because it would not poll well. At that time, the public‚Äôs view of carbon taxes were negative and Obama did not agree with the idea of carbon taxes either.\r\n16. Pope Francis suggests that we, as members of the world accept the modern science of climate change. He has also said that the Paris conference is a step in the right direction, however it is still not enough. Pope Francis suggests that we continue to speak out about this global issue, take action and to pray for the human race.\r\n17. a) Vote for leaders who will support a carbon tax, invest in renewable energy, end fossil fuel subsidies, etc.\nb) Urge government leaders to stop destructive logging and other harmful industrial development.\r\nc) Consume/buy different products that do not contain palm oil. Reduce your consumption of beef by going vegan/vegetarian or eating chicken instead.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Victoria Lee", "channel": "UCnz7UzdLS6pS5xs-AJNPh8A", "votes": "402", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTrO7iq3JukxBkAMMr572oE4_VxnD3QVVXp1iFX2PQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx1WXBIwcRmv1D3kdR4AaABAg", "text": "After having watched this documentary, I have a few thoughts to share. One, the major climate change activists are hypocrites. Two, science isn't about consensus. Three, natural phenomena can cause climate change. Four, CO2 isn't a pollutant! Five, past climate predictions were wrong. Six, forecasting models aren't infallible. Finally, the Paris Climate Accord didn't apply equally to all parties. I'll discuss each point in detail below.\n\nThe major climate change advocates featured in this film are hypocrites; they don't really BELIEVE what they've preached to us. Leo DeCaprio still uses a private jet, which leaves a huge carbon footprint!.Al Gore has a 20,000 sq. foot (about 1,820 sq. meters) mansion; that's huge! That also uses up a lot of natural resources, which, in turn, leaves a huge carbon footprint. Finally, Barack Obama and his family bought a mansion on Martha's Vineyard; better yet, it was near the beach. It's near the water. Riddle me this, Folks: why would someone spend $15 MILLION on a nice mansion if it were to be overcome by the rising seas in 12 years? He wouldn't! That alone tells you Obama didn't believe his climate change talk; if he did, he wouldn't have spent millions on a place that'll be flooded out in 10-12 years.\n\nBefore I continue to my second point, let me say this; let me relate my personal experience. When I bought my house 10 years ago, I had a chance to buy a nice place along the river; it was bigger, nicer, and cheaper than the place I ultimately bought on higher ground. When my Realtor asked me if I wanted to look at this nice, 3BR ranch, I said no; there will be flooding issues here. Though the house itself hasn't flooded, the road down by the river has flooded out over 20 times since I've lived here. I bought a place 100 feet or so higher. Why? Because there's far less chance of being flooded out up here where I am. To put it another way, if my neighborhood floods, we're ALL in deep you know what!\n\nSecondly, science isn't about consensus; it's about understanding nature, the world, and the universe; it's about finding the laws that govern the same. Furthermore, science is often wrong; just because a majority of scientists believe something doesn't mean that they're right! For example, for centuries, it was scientific consensus that Ptolemy was right. It was scientific consensus that the Earth was the center of the universe. Copernicus and Galileo said that the opposite was true; they said that the sun was the center of the universe, and that the Earth revolved around the sun. Galileo was charged with being a heretic, and ended up living the rest of his life under house arrest; even though he was right, he was vilified. Scientific consensus is often wrong, and the Geocentric model is one of history's most glaring examples of this.\n\nThree, natural phenomena can and do impact our climate, and we cannot do a thing about them. Just look at any volcanic eruption. They spew HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TONS of debris into the atmosphere! They change the climate too. Mt. Tambora erupted in 1815. The eruption caused the year without a summer the following year. The year without a summer caused famine the world over; it was during this time that the Irish potato famine started. That's just one example. Here are five massive volcanic eruptions caught on camera: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTep1FxIuTQ\n\nThis doesn't consider the undersea volcanoes. There are many volcanoes on the ocean floor, and they pour huge amounts of hot lava in to the ocean. This increases ocean temperature. That, in turn, influences climate.\n\nFour, CO2 is NOT a pollutant, folks! Not only do we exhale CO2; it's the breath of life for plants. What oxygen is to us, CO2 is to plants. By the process of photosynthesis, plants inhale CO2, and they exhale O2. More CO2 equals more plant growth; more plants equal more photosynthesis; more photosynthesis equals more O2 for us. I learned this in 7th grade! I learned this before high school. WTF are they teaching in schools? Is photosynthesis even being taught? I have to wonder, since so many people believe the lie that CO2 is a pollutant.\n\nFive, past climate change predictions were wildly wrong. I'm old enough to remember when it was called global cooling back in the 1970s. When the Earth didn't turn in to a massive block of ice, the name was changed to global warming. When that fantasy didn't happen, it was called climate change. Folks, the climate is ALWAYS changing! Though I could furnish many examples, I'll simply cite Al Gore's notorious 2009 prediction that the ice would be gone in five years. 2009 plus 5 years brings us to 2014. Oh, wait; the ice is still HERE in 2020! Here's Al Gore in his own words: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsioIw4bvzI. Watch and listen for yourselves; don't take my word for it. The problem is that these predictions have a nasty habit of being wrong, so thinking people are less inclined to believe them.\n\nThat brings me to my sixth point: computer models aren't infallible. Actually, they're quite fallible, Folks. It depends on what variables are considered. Models also depend on the weight given to certain variables. If there isn't sufficient weight given to the effects of local terrain, a weather forecasting model can and will be wrong. What's the old saying about computers? GIGO: garbage in, garbage out. Look, we can't even predict next week's weather with any degree of certainty! How can we predict the climate decades from now?\n\nBefore I get someone waving their fingers at me reminding me that weather and climate are not the same thing, I'll say DUH! You don't say. What is climate, but long term weather for a certain region of the world? Furthermore, forecasting models all operate by the same principles; whether one is forecasting weather, long term climate, or COVID-19. Models depend on the assumptions that are examined, and they depend on the weight given to the assumptions. Let's look at the notorious Imperial model that was used to shut down the world for COVID-19, shall we?\n\nDid you know that that model was so bad that, when you put the same variables in, you got different answers out? It's true! At the very least, if one puts A,B, and C in to a model, one should always get X, Y, and Z out every single time. Secondly, the Imperial model was constructed with the assumption that people would do NOTHING in response to the spread of the virus. Common sense tells us that this is BS! Whether on an individual or collective level, if there's a problem, won't people respond to it? Won't they take steps to prevent the problem impacting them? For example, if there's a beach that has experienced shark attacks, are people going to SWIM in those waters? Finally, the Imperial model was done in FORTRAN. FORTRAN is a computer language that was OBSOLETE 40 years ago! It's not been taught for decades in STEM programs. Even so, the Imperial model was constructed using FORTRAN. Recent experience has shown us how WRONG forecasting models can be, Folks! They're not perfect tools. Forecasting models can be wrong, so their results need to be viewed with skepticism.\n\nFinally, The Paris Climate Accord was not fair, let alone equally applied, to all parties. Did you know that China and India didn't have hard targets to meet? Did you know that their targets were not targets at all? China and India were subjected to what amounted to long term suggestions. IOW, they were allowed to continue being the world's worst polluters! Meanwhile, the US had hard targets to meet, targets what would've put us at a severe economic disadvantage vis-a-vis China and India. Though I'm far from happy with President Trump, one good thing he did was pull us out of a treaty that was totally unfair to the US.\n\nEven if we don't look at the fairness aspect of the accord, there are practical considerations as well. Let me ask you this: if we, the US, stop polluting, while China and India are allowed to continue polluting, how does that help our planet? Aren't there upper air winds? Don't these upper air winds affect the whole planet? That said, wouldn't these same upper air winds carry and distribute China's and India's pollution all over the world? How does THAT help reduce pollution? How does that reduce climate change? Common sense once again gives us the answer: it doesn't. To his credit, Mr. DeCaprio acknowledged that the Paris Accord didn't go far enough.\n\nTo recap, many climate change advocates are hypocrites; they don't walk the walk. Two, science isn't about consensus, and the scientific consensus is often wrong. Three, natural phenomena impact the climate; they impact the climate more than we humans do; and we can do nothing about them. Four, CO2 isn't a pollutant; in fact, it's the breath of life for our plants. Five, past climate predictions were off the mark; why should we believe the predictions now? Six, forecasting models are anything but infallible; just look at your forecast for next week, and compare it to what the actual weather was. Finally, not only did the Paris Accord not go far enough; it was grossly unfair, because it allowed China and India to continue polluting the atmosphere. How does THAT help pollution or climate change? In order to have a meaningful impact, shouldn't all nations have the same targets? Shouldn't all nations clean up their air?\n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts on climate change.

{"cid": "Ugx1WXBIwcRmv1D3kdR4AaABAg.9903LWpriPL99a45VePQLf", "text": "PLEASE READ WHOLE POST!\nLet me just start off by saying that I appreciate your well thought out, reasoned argument. As it is, I'll do my best to disprove what you said. There will be a trend of you presenting evidence, and me saying why I disagree with what your evidence means and how much it matters.\n        First, you mentioned that some climate advocates are hypocritical and don't bother to cut down their carbon footprint. This is not something I can argue with, but I can say that it doesn't matter if they are hypocritical. In the words of Michelle Obama, \"When they go low, we go high.\" Even if others have a large carbon footprint, we can do better. Even if we aren't doing well right now, we can and should do better in the future. Hypocrisy is only a sign that we aren't improving now.\n        Sorry, but your personal experience means nothing. Yes, the roads below you most likely have been flooded, and you've done yourself a service by buying a property in a higher location. Congrats, you'll flood later than the rest of us. Enjoy! This doesn't mean that you've reduced your carbon footprint. All it means is that you won't be part of the people that are forced to relocate by climate change.\n        Second, you mentioned that the scientific consensus is often wrong. In this case, it is not the scientific consensus that we are believing. We are believing the DATA that the consensus has brought in. What you don't understand is what the consensus is based on, and in this case, it's based off of decades of measurements. Here, I don't expect to convince you of anything. Instead, I''ll let the websites that I'm presenting attempt to convince you. \nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/ https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/ If you would also look at the rest of the vital signs on the website, it would go far to increase your understanding of our world. It contains several graphs that should be more persuasive than anything that I can say.\n        Third, I agree with you that we cannot change natural phenomena, it's out of our control. However, this website by NASA (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page4.php) states that, \"On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\" \n        Fourth, carbon dioxide is certainly part of photosynthesis. However, this does not mean that it doesn't warm up the planet or contribute to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide absorbs energy, including infrared (heat). Then, it re-emits it in all directions, including back at the earth. My source for this is another NASA website (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle/page5.php). It has a graph of carbon dioxide's ppm (parts per million) level, and it nearly matches the graph of the global temperature averages below it.\n        Fifth, Al Gore and other past predictions may not have been correct. However, in this case, it is not our opinions or predictions that should convince you, but the past and the graphs of earth's temperature. This website's graph (https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) will show you that this is not just the climate changing on its own, but something far more drastic. You can see that in the graph, the amount of carbon dioxide is reaching far higher levels than ever before. As for evidence of temperature rising, this graph (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/global-warming/last-2000-years) should explain itself on its own. At the end near the 2000's, there is a large spike upwards.\n        Sixth, people do not actually always respond to problems, even if they are presented right in front of them. An example of this is Hurricane Matthew, where 35% of people under evacuation order in South Carolina never actually left their homes. (https://theconversation.com/thousands-of-people-didnt-evacuate-before-hurricane-matthew-why-not-66724) Yes, computer models are not 100% accurate at all. However, we have improved quite a bit. A few examples of this include\n        Seventh, in this case, you do not need to look at a computer model/prediction of climate change to see proof of it. Here, we can look at the past yet again. Please refer to the websites that I've posted earlier that include graphs about carbon dioxide's ppm(parts per million) and global temperature averages. I'll post this website again (https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) for you to view. It contains lots of evidence for climate change, from Global Temperature Rise, Warming Oceans, Shrinking Ice Sheets, Glacial Retreat, Decreased Snow Cover, Sea Level Rise, Declining Arctic Sea Ice, and Extreme High Temperature Events(Hurricanes).\n        Finally, the Paris Accord wasn't perfect. However, it is a step in the right direction. Why would we draw ourselves out of it? Instead, we need to serve as an example for the other nations in and out of it. Even if other countries don't make the vital first step of agreeing to it, we have a responsibility to. If we know what is the correct course of action, then we should take the lead and do our best to follow the course of action that is best for everyone. The statement, \"They didn't do it, why should we?\" is intellectually lazy, foolish, and childish. It says that even through we know what is right, we choose not to do it and use the indecision of other countries as an excuse to step back and keep doing what we're doing. We can do better. We can take the lead against what we know is a major issue, and do our best to keep the world in the best condition possible. \n        There is no recap. Instead, I will BEG you to read the whole post. It'll be worth your time, I promise you.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Aaron Licht", "channel": "UCzrob0EIHagdSg9wyyTjSFg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQh2CevSFaNzEPyT58AOemwWvKZbW5OFkKfKdVrBA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Let me tell you a story from when I bought my house 10 years ago.\n\nThere was a cute 3BR, 2 bath ranch along the river in my city. Not only that, it was available at a good price. I didn't buy it. Why? Because of flooding. Though the house itself never flooded out (it's on a little hill), the road it's on has; IOW, I would've been trapped in my house until the flood waters receded.\n\nI ended up buying a smaller, more expensive house on higher ground. It's 100'-150' above the river. IOW, if it floods were I am, we're ALL in deep shit! I bought the house there because I don't want to worry about flooding.\n\nThat leads me back to my original question: if Former POTUS Obama really BELIEVED what he says about climate change, why did he buy a waterfront property? It looks like he doesn't really BELIEVE it. IOW, its validity is open to question...", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Marky Mark", "channel": "UCKPvo1ezukz2XQUtDHIyHKw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR-OhG-tsuUquOw19eXP2AcxFTTFWbvmxHbjyLWSA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's entirely plausible Obama thought \"even if climate change destroys the value of my property, I would still prefer to own it now\". Obama is rich after all, a $15 million mansion isn't exactly a big deal to him. Just because it's not clear why Obama did something, does not mean that now all conspiracy theories are true and that his behavior indicates that Obama secretly isn't concerned about climate change. In fact, he may even have gotten a good deal on an insurance policy for the house, or, he may have done research on what areas of the world will be most impacted by flooding (he has top secret clearance to military data after all), and perhaps the military data deems that area to be low risk for flooding short-term (who knows long term). Or perhaps Obama plans to sell the property long before the risk is very high. Or perhaps Obama is overly optimistic and believes humanity will solve climate change before it would affect his property. There are literally dozens of reasons I can think of why Obama would do this, and *yet he still believes in climate change as a global threat*. In other words, what you're using as the basis of your argument has tons of baked in *assumptions about Obama's reasoning*. These assumptions are driving you to conclusions, but the assumptions themselves are not proven, so your conclusions are on shaky ground at best, and in fact, there is overwhelming evidence that your assumptions are entirely misguided. You would have to ask Obama yourself before jumping firmly to such a dramatic conclusion that he doesn't care about climate change and that therefore it's all somehow a farce.

Maybe military data suggests it will be flooded in 60 years time, or 100 years time. That would factor into Obama's decision. Again, maybe Obama believes (optimistically) that combined with the timeframe, we'll solve climate change by then. Or maybe he only plans to own it for 20 years. And again, where is the source for this anyway, how do you know he bought a mansion? Assuming you even have read a correct source, you still have not proven that he thinks he's \"throwing his money away\". You're also conveniently ignoring all the reasons Obama does want to own a mansion. Maybe he thinks his kids will love it. Maybe he thinks it's worth owning a beach property because even if the world ends, he still gets to enjoy the beach some before it's all said and done. Again, a rich person has the luxury to make that decision, so it's not such a big deal to him like it would be to you or me. Either way, there is no compelling evidence that Obama thought to himself \"Oh I don't believe in climate change, that's why I'll buy a beachfront property\". There are plenty of reasons he would have thought \"Despite climate change being a threat, I still want to own this property\".

DiCaprio feels honoured that he has been given the title of UN Messenger of Peace \r\n2. Before, he would read about how hunters would wipe out entire species and ruin ecosystems and how angry that made him. Now, we are doing this knowingly on a much larger scale.\r\n3. The energy sources that power most of our electricity and transportation are the fossil fuels: coal, oil, natural gas. There are many new ways of extracting these resources that are extremely destructive, such as mountaintop removal for coal, fracking for natural gas, offshore drilling for oil and the tar sands. As a result of these harmful methods, forests are cleared out which destroys habitats, water and air are polluted. It affects wildlife and native communities as well.\r\n4. There used to be a plentiful amount of ice that was hard and blue that melted very slowly. Now the ice is white and melts quickly, so there is less of it.\r\n5. The entire state of Florida could be wiped away due to rising sea levels. The Mayor of Miami has implemented pumps all around the city as well as raised the roads to combat rising sea levels. It is a 100 million dollar project and it will take a significant amount of time, around 40-50 years.\r\n6. There have been protests in China to make power plants more transparent to the public by revealing their monitoring data every hour. This is so that the people of China can hold those in charge of these emissions accountable for their actions. There is currently a national pollution map database that shows all the major factories in China, 9000 of them, most of which are not in compliance with the standards. China has also begun in switching to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\r\n7. The people of India are suffering with massive power shortages and blackouts. 300 million people in India are living without power or any light. Many families have been forced to use cow dung or biofuel, a form of renewable energy and wonder why other countries cannot do the same.\r\n8. The United States of America is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in history.\r\n9. Over one billion people are living without electricity.\r\n10. In the last 30 years, 50% of coral has been lost\r\n11. Forest fires release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.\r\n12. Cows release methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.\r\n13. It would be difficult to build 100 Gigafactories because they are enormous; up to 15 million square feet. Tesla is the only company as of now that uses a Gigafactory and it would require other companies to contribute to this transition as well.\r\n14. The carbon tax is a basic attack or punishment for any activity that releases carbon into the air so that people consume less of it. I think that the carbon tax is a great idea in theory, but it can lead to ignorance.  Many people still do not believe that climate change is a problem and the carbon tax is an excuse or conspiracy to get citizens to give the government more money.\r\n15. Obama was not able to mention a carbon tax during his campaign because it would not poll well. At that time, the public‚Äôs view of carbon taxes were negative and Obama did not agree with the idea of carbon taxes either.\r\n16. Pope Francis suggests that we, as members of the world accept the modern science of climate change. He has also said that the Paris conference is a step in the right direction, however it is still not enough. Pope Francis suggests that we continue to speak out about this global issue, take action and to pray for the human race.\r\n17. a) Vote for leaders who will support a carbon tax, invest in renewable energy, end fossil fuel subsidies, etc.\r\nb) Urge government leaders to stop destructive logging and other harmful industrial development.\r\nc) Consume/buy different products that do not contain palm oil. Reduce your consumption of beef by going vegan/vegetarian or eating chicken instead.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Victoria Lee", "channel": "UCnz7UzdLS6pS5xs-AJNPh8A", "votes": "23", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTrO7iq3JukxBkAMMr572oE4_VxnD3QVVXp1iFX2PQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If humans emitted CO2 had nothing to do with the climate, life on earth would not be possible. You're in denial of something that sustains your own survival. Without greenhouse gases like CO2 and H2O, life would freeze in the absence of sunlight which happens half the day on each side of the planet. For example, the atmospheric temperature goes hundreds below zero in the moon equivalent of night. (google it). This is what precludes us from making a habitat on Mars. Mars doesn't have greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but it does have CO2 in ice which is why Elon Musk wanted to nuke Mars.  Just like Nitrogen and Oxygen absorb sunlight to emit radiation to make sky blue, H2O, CO2, and CH4 take sunlight and emit infrared radiation making the earth warm. Not only that, if you were right about humans emissions of CO2 doing nothing, then most pharmaceutical industry also would not exist. Most drugs are organic and use the method of infrared spectroscopy to identify molecules which applies the same principle that explains the greenhouse effect and results in global warming/climate change. \nTaking the opinion from both sides of people who claim that earth is flat vs earth is round would still make you incorrect. Anthropogenic climate change is a fact. It's as undeniable as the earth is round.

There was a lack of technology and they were dealing with two worlds wars, multiple dictators such as Hitler, Stalin, Mao ect., a great depression, a very real threat of nuclear war and much much more. They had plagues too much worse than what we have today. People as a whole messed this up, because they were busy with other things. People aren't so bad as a whole sir. There's alot to learn out there for all of us. As a millenial my generation got the same crap yours is now, but you can't define a whole generation so simply. My generation as a whole isn't attacking yours and yours as a whole isn't blaming mine. I wish you luck in all you do. Build your motivation by imagining what could be and why it's worth working towards. Really focus on it. Psychology can help you overcome depression, so that it's not as frequent at least. Theres tons of videos online for it. Learn to ask for help if you need it. Look to great people for motivation and stay away from Nihilist and cynics as best you can. Remember that most people are rooting for your generation. I'm one of them. Depression sucks. I've experienced it. My family had a suicide, a baby die and my closest cousin when he was 17 years old got shot in the head. He lived and is really struggling with addiction now 7 years later. There's alot more and if we met you would never know these burdens by looking at me. Yours maybe worse and I pray they aren't. Keep your head up. You can overcome your struggles.

That is because of your useless Republican or Democratic parties that use so fucking stupid it is what is going to fuck us over.

Instead, 1 molecule of CH4 has the same heat trapping potential as 23 molecules of CO2. This website (https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials) will explain it better than I can.  \"CH4 emitted today lasts about a decade on average, which is much less time than CO2. But CH4 also absorbs much more energy than CO2. The net effect of the shorter lifetime and higher energy absorption is reflected in the GWP. The CH4 GWP also accounts for some indirect effects, such as the fact that CH4 is a precursor to ozone, and ozone is itself a GHG.\"", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Aaron Licht", "channel": "UCzrob0EIHagdSg9wyyTjSFg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQh2CevSFaNzEPyT58AOemwWvKZbW5OFkKfKdVrBA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Basically, you are trying to deny Climate Change because Leonardo DiCaprio has a somewhat large carbon footprint. Not only is this illogical and stupid due to him only being a messenger, but it also states in the end that a portion of the film's profits were donated as a carbon tax to remove its carbon footprint. As for \"They hide Nikola Tesla's work,\" what does that even mean? Yes, the industrial revolution included John Rockefeller, who created a company called Standard Oil. His oil was then used in electricity, transportation, and before lightbulbs, to light houses and cities. When the United States broke up Rockefeller's company into multiple other companies that we know today, they continued to pull fossil fuels out of the ground at fast rates. Yes, mining lithium takes heavy machinery that can be powered by fossil fuels, but might also be powered by renewable sources. Yes, we will keep using fossil fuels until we transition. However, it's better to use fossil fuels to create lithium batteries to help make solar power viable instead of using fossil fuels in any other way. Yes, there is not a war right now. It would be significantly harder to get rid of money entirely than to work against climate change. Getting rid of money would require an entirely new system that would probably take years if not decades to set up and stabilize properly, during which time fossil fuels will be mined at exponentially increasing rates.

However, there is great hope, but it will require vast changes in the way societies treat our planet.  It just seems like a lot of people are standing by with their heads in the sand because the issue just doesn't seem to affect them viscerally...climate change was voted the 18th most important issue in a poll of Americans in this upcoming election.  Probably because they may not see the effects of what is happening in their every-day lives.  The reality is we are in a proverbial raft headed towards a huge waterfall, represented by climate instability, loss of food source, armed conflict, and mass population decline (and destruction of our planet's biodiversity).  However, once we get social momentum for this issue going, for people making every day choices for the planet, things will change.  We need this now.  50 years ago, when the USA saw the importance or value of putting a man on the moon, they mobilized resources and made it happen.  The USA can also solve the climate crisis by developing technology to capture carbon and turning toward clean energy.  In fact, as the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, you could say the USA has an obligation to do so.  \"Those with great ability have great responsibility\".", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "ScottyBallz", "channel": "UClR5NgK1xGgwHk2Ou5yua-A", "votes": "72", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRnmVgUoP26Fiboq_McwPaJyGWRN6Bc782YbdHsm0aExbdrFH6PnkzsNuiWHCft=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
