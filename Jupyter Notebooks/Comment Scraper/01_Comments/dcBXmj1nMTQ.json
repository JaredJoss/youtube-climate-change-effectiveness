Actually, CO2 doesn't drive temperature to beging with. It's the other way around. Higher Ocean temperature leads to less CO2 dissolved in water and vice versa. The only relevant source of CO2 is the Oceans. Not Volcanoes, burning forests or people in their SUVs. Mankind produces such a tiny amount of CO2 per year, that the plants on earth are absorbing it in a week. Don't forget, our food depends on CO2. Without it, we would die. So be happy we're seeing incrfeasing CO2 levels. 800-1000ppm would be great. \nI can tell you a secret that not even the IPCC knows: Our weather is 99.999% driven by the sun and 0.001% by water vapor.", "time": "3 months ago (edited)", "author": "Fuch Zenn", "channel": "UCpBXXiIb4EVqGYxnAzDcY0A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQR-3ukIdeiVxjqieL2BkNxDHDwcfz11W86X5fVgA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yeah sure guys, the batteries you need grow on battery trees and don't come from mines and old school means of creation. Has the earth as a whole 'warmed' to the tune of 1-1.25 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years. Pretty clear by science it has, as it also had for the over 8 100 year cycles before that (also not heavily science debated). The issue is the impact of man on this change, and I think its an honest debate despite social media saying otherwise. CO2 increases, as in the chart shown here, usually have followed an inverse in global temps (not shown here). I think that is at least important to note. Am I a 'climate denial freak?' No. Looking at the science the earth is warming. Am I a 'climate alarmist?' Also no. I can't find evidence in the data that is currently touted about how we are doomed without immediate action.

As for the storms we have they have never reach change, they have not gotten stronger if you refer to previous storm over the last 50 years, you would note that the death toll, and damages have been reduced by a lot in the US. I referred to the US primarily because infrastructure matters in this situation, the storms haven’t gotten worse, compared to thousands of years ago, you can clearly state that our current weather isn’t bad or worse. In addition Oil actually help to reduce our carbon footprint, cuz it means we rely less on coal, EV- electric vehicles also do not help with carbon emissions as they pose a great manufacturing carbon emissions during production period and the continue use as most power grids are powered by coal, also the fact that Lithium has to be Mine, processed and transported, and manufacture into a battery. This also remain true for wind turbines, so the Us has reduce it carbon footprint by almost 40-50% over the last 4 years. However the Eu, Africa, and Asia has increased their carbon footprint by almost 40-50% so essentially we are like a dog trying to catch our tail. \nThe proper process would be research, and funding for renewable energy, followed by implementation of those energy across our grids, as well as maintaining our previous grid through the phase out in case of failure. This would help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel, also very important is to allow private companies to manufacture these good and equipment that rly on these good, because the number way to get everyone onboard is cost of service so if it’s cheaper the gas it’ll catch on fast", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "M Dynasty", "channel": "UCzT62iO1YYqnCOR2g5Zvlog", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTq966F2R7yyNg7pxQN5sAwQAWO4vSuI5nZ1UxcfbU=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Big companies need the most resources and make up the biggest polluters, so local and smaller is better.\n\n4) universal basic income so people dont have \"to make a living\" at any cost and follow their passions- no damaging, stupid or unnecessary work\n\n5) make hemp biodiesel (and other biodiesels) make up 30% of all fuel compulsory in the economy and make investments. Tackle food waste and make it maximal 5% of all produced. Go towards 0% fossil fuels with improved technology. Swap most plastics for hemp-derived materials\n\n6) sustainability index- make an index of the worst environmental offender-practices. Ban those that are not needed and bring within limits those that can be made sustainable.

I have not physically been there, but the Indian govt. does keep records on temperatures which I can easily look up from anywhere in the world today! It shows that over 200 years it has gotten warmer there by around 2 degree Celsius in Mumbai itself. It further shows it has gotten .3 degrees Celsius in Delhi since 1930 (no data for that time frame in Mumbai specific). So 1. an average 2 degree Celsius over 2 centuries with data showing most occurring well over 100 years ago doesn't fit a post saying winters have gone away. 2. Most 1st and 2nd world countries have reduced carbon emissions in the last 40 years, making still up and coming nations like China and India the ones who are greatly increasing emissions. No blame there, as cheaper energy to lift up a population is a major reason the others exist today. \n\nTo cut it short, all I am saying is that the observation of temperature in Mumbai over the course of your lifetime in no way supports your post stating that winters 'went away' in Mumbai. It appears by data you don't or have never really had a 'winter' there anyway. All I know of Mumbai is sadly the negative... a lot of scammers. This does seem to be a far too common reality there, but anyone I have met from 'that region at least' has been amazing. If you are there I wish you well.

However let me put it this way, as kids we wore sweaters to school for it used to be cold enough to say winter was there. Now when I visit Mumbai around that time, I feel I’m in a desert climate, too hot, even early mornings in winter. Indian winters vary a lot by the state you live in & Mumbai used to have mild winters. The weather has drastically changed not in a 100 years but in 3-4 decades due to overcrowding, uncontrolled development, loss of green cover, increase in the number of vehicles, pollution, etc. Indian Meteorological data is unreliable & often manipulated.

Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of “eco-refugees,” threatening political chaos, said Brown, director of the New York office of the UN Environmental Program.  He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human…\r\nAl Gore predicted the end of Arctic ice sheets by 2004, causing severe rises in sea level.

There was no combustible engines or industry back then. That's climate change. Now let me ask you this: I'm a banker. You want to buy a house on the coast of Florida or England lets say. Now, according to most of these people who say the best case scenario is that the oceans rise 10' in the next 20yrs. Worst case 100'. Now, how stupid of a business man would I be if I gave you a 30yr mortgage? Now multiply that by 100's of thousands of people. The banks don't care because they know its a scam. And notice the one's who push the message the most are the one's leaving the biggest carbon footprint. Lol. There are scientific facilities at the North and South Poles. Did you know all the scientists laughed when they were asked about global warming? Its a money making scam. Wake up. Do you know how many people I've heard tell me that its too late in 5, 7, 10, 12, 15 years to reverse it? Well its been about 20 years and here we are. Lastly, fill a cup with ice. Now fill it with water to the brim. Now let it sit out till the ice melts. Guess what. Your cup didn't overflow. Its the same with with the earth. Did you ever think maybe these scientists are told to tell us that or other wise they lose funding? Wake up. It is so arrogant of man to think that we can raise the tempature of the earth from greenhouse gas. Amazing. Its a scam.

{"cid": "UgyfLmfEotJba9m4Vkp4AaABAg", "text": "What is the cause of climate change and how can it be solved?\nMany people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.\nThis is a bit convincing, but not correct.\nThe exact cause of climate change is \"thermal excess\" on the earth.\nTherefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the \"thermal excess\".\n\n\"GREEN NEW DEAL\" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. \nThe biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. \nTherefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. \nThis is a fundamental problem.\nAlso, waste is another problem. \nWaste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.\n\nAlthough there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.\nTrump should publicize the effects of \"One trillion trees\" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.\n\nWhy is \"One trillion trees\" so effective?\nFirst of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. \nforests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.\n\nIn addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.\nPhotosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.\nIt absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.\nOne trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. \nThe reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally \"overheating,\" but rather carbon dioxide.\n\nHow can you get a lot of land? We have to use the desert.\nBut how to supply a huge amount of water? \nThis is a solution --> @.\nIf you like the movie, leave a comment.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "지구백신 발명가", "channel": "UCe5pmwfw2FLokGj2gw_T2_w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTAej7aNBYB__-DwqsLt1jDx6JtiqsLPvknvHdgOg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

'Each year, [Strong] explains as background to the telling of the novel's plot, the World Economic Forum convenes in Davos, Switzerland. Over 1,000 CEO's, prime ministers, finance ministers, and leading academics gather in February to attend meetings and set economic agendas for the year ahead. With this as a setting, he then says: 'What if a small group of these world leaders were to conclude that the principle risk to of the rich countries? And if the world is to survive, the rich countries would have to sign an agreement reducing their impact on the environment. Will they do it? And Strong, driving as I take notes, looks at me. Then his eyes go back to Highway 17. The man who founded the United Nations Environment Program and who wrote parts of the Brundtland Report and who in 1992 will try to get the world's leaders to sign just such an agreement, savors the question hanging in the air. Will they do it? Will the rich countries agree to reduce their impact on the environment? Will they agree to save the earth? 'Strong resumes his story. 'The group's conclusion is 'no. ' The rich countries won't do it. They won't change. So, in order to save the planet, the group decides: Isn't the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse?

(Jeremiah 7, Psalm 48, Romans 1-3...) God gave us His written word, originally in Hebrew and Greek, and called this book the Bible, to show us how to live and be; The Bible was written by holy men of old, many years ago, as God moved them through the Holy Ghost (2 Peter 1:21); And all scripture was written by inspiration of God, for us to be corrected, and reproved, by walking in His truth (2 Timothy 3:16,17); We have a most loving, and merciful God, to be praised and obeyed, from the moment we arise, til we go to sleep at night, yet much of the world won’t take heed, and go their own way; (Psalm 113:3, Ezekiel 39, Jeremiah 12, Ephesians 5, Titus 3, 2 Timothy 3..... ) He is the King of kings, LORD of lords, He is our Savior, Creator of all, but most won't even acknowledge Him, and mock Him with much gall; We’re in the “Great Tribulation” now of Matthew 24, the LORD has opened up the seals (Revelation 5-22), so we can see truth more; In Daniel chapter 12 vs 9, God told Daniel the seals were closed til the end of time; If you study from Isaiah to the book of Malachi, hopefully you will see that this is all about the end times; Too many false gospels, signs and wonders, none have the truth, since God has allowed Satan to take his seat in the temple, and now rules, according to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 (2 Corinthians 11, Revelation 2,3, 17-22)Judgment has begun on the house of God, in 1 Peter chapter 4, God is starting with the churches, and then to many more; (Ezekiel 9, Jeremiah 25...) God is our Faith, our Baptism, our LORD, and Father of all, and only He can save, not the pope, priest, you, or me, and none can come to Him, unless He draws, and only by His mercy; (John 6:44, 10:30, Ezekiel 36, Romans 1-9, 1 Timothy 2:5, Titus 3, Ephesians 1-5...)So as the days of Noah, because of too much sin, when the floods came, and took most everyone/thing away, except for the animals on ark, and Noah's family of eight, So shall our LORD and Savior, Jesus Christ (both the same), come and destroy this earth with fire on the dreadful Judgment Day, with only a remnant saved (Isaiah 1, 10, 11, Jeremiah 23, 31, Ezekiel 6, Joel 2, Malachi 4, Romans 9, 11, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Revelation  11, 12, 18-22….), and He alone is the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2);Please come soon LORD Jesus, please come soon, let Satan and sin no longer rule, for many are suffering, more and more each day, especially the children, LORD we pray; Please come soon dear LORD, please come save (Revelation 18-22)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "MAMA J", "channel": "UCCDeXATZbrIA2KvO5jGRG0g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTKNMvERnftU0kNb8od-O_VmaMhA6EnT9fcQQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

US healthcare is and has been a mess, but that can truly be said of any country you cite. Most of those countries and the US all seem to be able to ensure that their populations were able to get assistance for this disease. So this particular pandemic isn't a good 'thought exercise' for healthcare overall imo. You can however look at plenty of less developed countries with various ways of dealing with health issues (this pandemic in particular) and draw some basic conclusions around type of governernance and  rights protections of the people.", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Kemp Kennedy", "channel": "UCD5vgEzR8jIEny0baPaqaow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTd9-yWBOQMbROFPk0VDVUZssUz599Np-paXMBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzO-R10hMAGyh59F_p4AaABAg", "text": "TOP 10 FACTS CLIMATE CHANGE FANATICS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW\n\n1. The current global warming started about 12,000 years ago. That's how the last ice age ended and the current geological period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won't last forever. Interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years.\n\n2. The rate at which the sea level is rising now is much lower compared to how it rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago – a period in which the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the Early Holocene Sea Level Rise if you want to learn more.\n\n3. The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the \"stability\" of the climate, you might want to look up:\n– The 8.2 Kiloyear Event\n– The Little Ice Age\n– The Year Without a Summer (1816)\n\n4. Chaos Theory tells us why the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum. No one can predict the climate, because the climate is a stupidly complex chaotic system.\n\n5. Compared to water, CO₂ plays an insignificant role in the global greenhouse effect. Because – and I'm not making this up – 95% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor. \n\n6.  During the Hirnantian glaciation the atmospheric CO₂ levels were 10–16 times higher than today. \n\n7. CO₂ is not a pollutant. CO₂ is plant food. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis – a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO₂ and water. Without CO₂ plants die. Without plants, we die. CO₂ is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO₂ is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery. There are real pollutants out there we should be worried about and CO₂ is not one of them.\n\n8. Compared to astronomical factors like solar activity or the Milankovitch Cycles or terrestrial factors like volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We're not a type I civilization.\n\n9. This may came as a shock to you, but we're actually in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation – the Quaternary Glaciation – look it up!\n\n10.  There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of anthropogenic climate change. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who said that \"Global Warming is pseudoscience\". Freeman Dyson said that \"Climate Change predictions are absurd\". Wikipedia has a List of scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming, but it only contains the names of those scientists \"who have their own Wikipedia article.\" Keep in mind that science doesn't work by consensus. Science isn't a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:\n\n“Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.”\n\nIn general, when you're convinced of your truth, make an effort to get out of the echo chamber and listen to a skeptic scientist who doesn't share your beliefs on the subject.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", "channel": "UCtvj8-yqUr9qHpRZLXO5V1g", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1bOB9AnngP3Pl3u1PVE_lXsj_UmDBvRxF8InHKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugwy4mU4Pi-wFqctMWN4AaABAg", "text": "Climate change is the current pretext to justify halting use of the land resource. Building upwards and ceasing expansion outwards causes home prices to skyrocket and places the lifetime earnings of citizens extracted through rent squarely into the hands of the International Socialists. Within a generation a nation is turned into a vassal. \n\nA similar campaign half a century ago employing agricultural land as the pretext caused home prices to launch from the ten thousand dollar to the million dollar level pricing homes beyond reach while simultaneously making million dollar an acre land unfeasible to farm.\n\nOrganized protest, including pleas from children, attends each attempted use of land.\n\nEach time another tract of land is “protected” the public cheers. Those most affected tighten the snare on their own demise. Thousands of homeless in each city. \n\nAll of the land on this planet was promised to the chosen few, together with the increase that it yields. It is being redeemed.\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\nPreserving farmland inspired a movement to protect all land from development instead of making forestland that we have in extravagant abundance available for housing. This restriction caused farmland values to skyrocket making it uneconomical to till. Homes that were $10,000 to $60,000 with the average price ranging from $10,000 in most cities to $24,000 in the more expensive regions rose to multi-millions as a result of the artificially created shortage. A mile width of forestland over a short distance near cities would eliminate the housing issue permanently. Saving a forest is ill-conceived. Nature ignores man’s declarations and continues on its usual course of cleansing by fire the forest of its dead, dying and diseased to make way for new growth, as it has been doing since time immemorial. \n\nA generation prevented from acquiring a home and becoming established lives for experience that soon devolves to escape by taking drugs.\n\nCitizens whose income enabled them to purchase a ten thousand dollar home with a value that now exceeds a million dollars are doomed. Their home must be sold to cover deferred property taxes and to repay loans secured by equity upon winding-up of their estate. The freedom that derives from owning your own home is ending.\n\nCivic governments reap a bonanza from property assessments generating billion dollar surpluses. This is “invested” in the equivalent of municipals that return $3 in forty years time for each $100 spent on acquiring them now. Young people work two shifts daily in order to keep a roof over their heads, one that they will never own. A third of the world away a hill of sand is transformed into a metropolis. \n\nCitizens have been conditioned to view with anathema and as evil National Socialism in which the resources of a nation and economic output of its population benefits their own country.\n\nAn enduring legacy of Communism as well as its ulterior motive is the departure of residents from family dwellings into highrises enabling International Socialists to capture their lifetime earnings through rent and for all time to subjugate these nations. Democratic nations enact regulations that are a bottomless pit in order to frustrate and end the construction and private ownership of homes.\n\nEconomic distortion arising from this deliberately created artificial shortage with all earnings going towards rent that enriches the chosen few acts like a cancerous tumor destroying its host.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "the Unrepentant", "channel": "UChs3Bej3QXicdThw5poQ23g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJ74K-mdnMtayccBimfvotKR-xZIixSM8WtA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You would not believe how many folk actually believe that co2 generates it's own heat. Now having got that out of the way. What happens when you put a blanket over you on a cold night? This is the same effect that co2 has on the planet! Now ... hang that same blanket about 5 feet above you. That is the effect that methane has on the planet! Now, instead of you being under the blanket, place a hot water bladder on the bed (pre heated to let's say 45 degrees Celsius). Time how long it takes for it to get to ambient temp. Do the same  with the blanket laying on top of it, and again with a blanket (5x thicker) hanging 5 feet above it. These are the same effect as greenhouse effects on our planet.  Now of course the ambient temp needs to be at a minimum one half of the original temp of the bladder! \nBoth co2 and methane are weak greenhouse gases!! With water vapor being considered to be the major player!\nThe original scientist that worked on this project in the 80's have already stated that they made a mistake in their calculations concerning the amount of water vapor increase with the increase in co2! The water vapor rate did not change enough to have the amount of effect that they had projected! This is the reason why the computer models dont work, they still have the water vapor formulas in their calculations!\nThis is also why, a lot of these scientists are backing down from their original claims. The global heating, is effective by having a larger volume of co2 in the atmosphere.  But, not enough to cause any concern!!!\n\nThis is the main reason why some people are trying to push a methane propaganda!

Go figure. Bad science in other words via a badly flawed model. \nThere is a new IPCC model tho that has existed since 2017, it isnt used much as it removes the fear of climate change. Its the solar forcing model, and it will be the only legal version to use for IPCC science starting 2022. \nA few more years and the hysteria can vanish. Lets hope global carbon taxes can be resisted that long, as in the end this conjured fear and hysteria are used to enslave us all. These evil people even abuse a spacal needs child, Greta, to promote that sinister agenda of global taxation to crush freedom. \n\nMeanwhile the destruction of habtable parts of the world with pollution, distributed poisons and related chemicals and overuse of resources is continuing unabated. Never mind devastating the seas with nitrogen and overfishing which will lead to outright destruction of the seas as something nice. Look forward to blue green algae taking over the oceans... and the sea stinking like a sewer. Even oceans in the end.

Just be aware that with the change in climate, CO2 levels also increase so CO2 emissions are actually an outcome of global warming. The problem is that we're currently releasing CO2 that isn't supposed to be released so we're switching that cycle around and therefore being the main cause of  our current change in climate.\n\nEdit: we can't perceive the Milankovitch cycles because they happen over thousands of years.

This is no cause for alarm,  and is definitely no reason to destroy the planets economic future!! The greenhouse effect does not change the daytime highs.

You add the two numbers together and then divide by two. This will give you the average daily temperature.  You then track this temp over time. The greenhouse effect, has almost no effect on daytime temperatures, your atmosphere conditions do, like humidity, cloud cover, wind patterns, and the jet stream. At night however, ground then saturated with the daytime heat that it absorb from the sun; then radiates with infrared heat. The greenhouse house gases then, and only then effect the cooling process of the environment.  It acts as a blanket making it harder for the ground to cool down.

Qatar is an oil exporter, which means that the country does produce a lot of pollution, but all the oil it produces is exported to Europe, the US, China, etc.  Thus, Europeans, Americans, Chinese, Indians, etc are all indirectly responsible of the pollution produced by Qatar since Qatar produces the oil OTHER COUNTRIES consume.  Then, Qataris seem to pollute much more than other countries, but it's only because they produce oil consumed by other countries and also because their population is only of 2.6 million.\n\nI'm not saying that Qatar and other oil producing countries aren't responsible of pollution, but they aren't responsible of the entire problems on the planet.  Remember that corporations produce what consumers buy.  Thus, all individuals are responsible for the pollution on our planet.\n\nIf the US, Europe, China, India and all other countries all reduced their oil imports, then oil producing countries would reduce their oil production and they would thus produce less pollution.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "P.

Thus, even if you don't believe in climate change, you should still try to adopt a more simple way of living.  It doesn't need to be radical either.  I've seen a research (it's in french, so I won't send it to you as I don't think you speak french…) that said that to reach the Paris agreement on climate, North Americans and Europeans should go back to the standard of living in the 1970s, where people traveled less, generally had 1 car per family, cooked their own food, bought less clothes, etc.  I'm pretty sure that the quality of living in the 1970s wasn't that bad.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "P.

Yet are also told that countries like China and India must be allowed to increase their CO2 emissions. Whatever reductions are to be had in the west are more than offset by increases in the developing world. \n\nAnother example. We must transition to wind and solar, yet the environmentalists oppose the extraction of the minerals and resources needed to build all this infrastructure. They oppose the opening of mines and smelters. In some cases they even oppose the building of wind farms and have launched legal challenges that delay their construction.\n\nWe are told we must decrease CO2 emissions, then the zero emissions nuclear power plants are shut down, which increases CO2 emissions because gas and coal-fueled electrical power plants are used to make up the shortfall. \n\nThe more you understand these contradictions, you come to see that many of these environmentalists are not genuinely green, but use environmentalism for ulterior motives. Environmentalism becomes a scare tactic of ever-egged claims and catastrophisation to push forward socialism and the transfer of jobs and wealth to the developing world.

There are many scientists (prominent with PHDs from various prestigious universities) that have questions and problems with current climate models. Not YT conspiracy nuts (though plenty of those around), but real, empirical data founded scientists presenting tons of data explaining this global 'crisis' is unfounded. Are they the majority? No. Not that science is dictated by vote. Could they be way off base? Sure. Though they at least present their data with verifiable stats. \n\nMy problem isn't with seeing a large consensus of scientists citing global warming over the last 100 years. Or their speculating what 'may' happen by models over the next 100 years. It is the silencing of scientists disputing those models (and some/many of the stats present and past). These guys show their data and make it available. It is usually the same data mainstream scientists used to make their claims. If they got it wrong, fine. Have the major climate crisis scientists show their mistakes. Problem is they don't. SERIOUSLY. They slander dissenters and never 'bother' to explain how they got it wrong or correct when others say they manipulated data. That isn't cool.

Even if those worse case scenarios are unlikely, even their possibility is worth taking seriously. We won’t get a best case scenario if we don’t do anything about the track we are headed down. We can’t keep arguing about whether the problem is really happening when people are already feeling the effects now. We can’t say for certain how well those models match reality because they extend into the future (a time when we can’t take measurements until it becomes the present). But just because there are more tweaks to make to the models doesn’t mean they ought to be thrown out wholesale. Their predictions are useful. Science is always evolving and there’s always room to improve, but the level of consensus on the issue of climate change is near the level of consensus on Evolution as concept. It’s not worthy of debate, especially when debate is being used to hold the conversation back from exploring actual solutions to the problem.\nAlso scientists don’t owe randos on the internet or fringes of their community a thorough debunking because the work they put into proving their claims and constructing and testing their models serves as enough refutation.", "time": "4 months ago (edited)", "author": "Julia Donati", "channel": "UCWekWQEZTnG6VmsY9gA7gGA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTLQWGhe-H4bki0JA7q9ferT1nCPaZjlhg_BA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

[9] The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. [10] But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
