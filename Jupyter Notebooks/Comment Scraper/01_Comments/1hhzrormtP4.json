Every time the Earth has had an abundance of CO¬≤ in the atmosphere, and the climate was significantly warmer, life has thrived. In contrast, when CO¬≤ and global temperatures have declined, life has struggled to survive. CO¬≤ was on a steady decline before the industrial revolution. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere was reduced by about 90% during the last 150 million years. If this trend had continued, CO2 would have inevitably fallen to levels that threaten the survival of plants, which REQUIRE a minimum of 150 ppm to survive. Considering the atmosphere was down to 280 ppm, pre-industrial revolution.

In fact it's what all societies have intended all thru history. Further, in full reforestation we'd be replacing two integral parts of the base of the whole global economy: Lumber/finished wood products & fish n the sea too. Economists know resource extraction as the primary layer of the economy. So we need a full switch to selection logging with stewardship consideration.  Still we'd get an adequate supply to fulfill demand.  This would greatly serve the building of local economies. Forests are known to be the great climate stabilizers. Forests were nature's carbon sink, prior to their being mowed down like lawn. Forests are also the key to nature's hydrological cycle. Reforestation would boost continental fresh water reserves, which is of utmost-ish importance.  A full switch off of petroleum combined with reforestation would be like the first thing to do for the oceans, along with plastic capture and global regulation of fishing. All this helps restore ocean pastures, as they're called & restore phytoplankton to its natural role as oxygen production.  Then micro-algae is known as the fastest growing plant, so makes oxygen & sequesters carbon fastest. Does it rival phytoplankton? The ozone layer still needs repair, as it is only the thin layer created & kept by the abundance of oxygen, floating upwards, getting split by UV as reaches the atmosphere into single O's then merges with an O2 to make O3, then falls back to Earth often as H2O2. Micro-algae grown in deserts awaiting to be reforested can be used as a fuel crop that doesn't displace arable food cropland, which would be within the zone of hydrological cycle adjacent to forests.

Did you guys do even the tiniest bit of research before prepping this. CO2 levels are LOW. At under 250 ppm, plants no longer conduct photosynthesis. They all die. At least, 1,000 ppm would be much better. The flowering plants, from which we derive most of our food, emerged at around 8,000 ppm CO2. CO2 is NOT causing climate change and the temps have NOT gone up 2 degrees per century due to humans. The weather temps were considerably hotter in the 1920s and 30s and mid 1800s. The climate is indeed changing. It's getting colder and fast. Before making a documentary, it would be prudent to actually understand the science: solar cycles - both long and short, solar forcing, ocean circulation, the Earth's electric circuit, Atlantic conveyor, and WORLD HISTORY. What we are currently seeing are NOT anthropological changes. It's going to get worse, much worse. By putting out utter non-science based propaganda, people will be wholely uniformed about what's truly going on and left totally unprepared when the SHTF. Stop listening to brainwashed Greta and deceptive Al Gore and actually read the science put out by experts not government-funded (or government threatened) to tow the NWO's New Green Deal line.

{"cid": "UgxWIUyg4qofqmpyzv94AaABAg", "text": "TRYING to get the attention of someone that can help humanity. They are lying to us about solar  Geoengineering clouds, the only thing they are controling is our Health, getting us sick for profit. We were fine without their help with putting toxic chemicals. Leave the earth without these Crooks killing us and using this GRANDIOSE lie and you all Believe the great lie. A chemical engineer told me that this is nothing more than Agent orange, this is the same thing they sprayed in Vietnam war. Someone NEEDS to compare the compounds that they sprayed in the Vietnam war. Compare the soot that falls on our cars, what in our blood stream and with what they sprayed in the Vietnam war. They aren't fooling anyone. Engineers told me the above information. Don't believe the Hype.\n\nDuring the spring and summer the geoengineered clouds look like SMOG and a HAZE/DIRT and in the Winter these massive clouds come from behind the mountains and the start at 8 am and the spray throughout the day intermittently. Pay attention behind what appears to be clouds which as I said starts at 8am. They geoengineered clouds are perpetuating these fires that run hotter than a normal fire due to the chemicals and the aluminum that is in these. We NEED TO STOP BILL GATES BECAUSE THESE CLOUDS ALSO ARE MAKING US SICK, CANCER, HEART DISEASE, BLOOD CLOTS, BLOOD DISORDERS, LEUKEMIA, CANCERS, ANXIETY, ALZHEIMER'S, MEMORY LOSS ETC. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WR6uSXW-8p4\n\n Holy Experience:¬† You missed my point entirely. You will live long enough to see the atrocity of this vaccine that they are trying to give us and eventually enough people will tell the tale of the mass destruction that this vaccine and all the chemicals they put in the clouds and all the junk that they're putting in her food because there's going to be a huge and there's not a better word or bugger word to describe the atrocity that is going to happen to the masses due to this vaccine and how much cancer we're going to start seeing due to this vaccine. I drop the mic and rest my case. \n\nYou all who have the money better start a lawsuit now. I would have but I lost my wealth in 2005  because I was diagnosed with cancer\n(Leukemia) and lost everything I owned. My computer is being messed with due to my post becauseI am right on point with what the elite is doing to us due to Bill Gates eugenics project. this is a project of the elite and then you can also look up on YouTube by someone named \"anonymous\" subject is the Georgia guidestones and the other subject would be the geoengineered clouds. \nThen look up on YouTube a show called \"Vice-killing Cancer\". \nI get biotech engineers in my cab for many years now and they've had the cure for cancer for many years and still they do the barbaric act of giving all of us including kids and babies chemotherapy and radiation which is so toxic when they've got the cure for less than 7 weeks by doing both immune therapy and stem cell therapy. \nWake up!!! Your house is on fireüî•. \n\nBelieve it or not Greta thunberg got that quote from I am sure reading my posts because I've been posting on YouTube video since 2010 about the geoengineered clouds and finally someone had the gumption in them to talk to the UN and funny to me that she ended up using my expression because I'm sure she had been reading my post because I've been trying to wake up people since 2010 after beating cancer naturally by using CBD oil, super green powders from walmart.com (only use the super green powders from walmart.com by Country Farm because that brand has the compounds including mushrooms and cordyceps that help with cancer, I used Black seed oil capsules, Pau D Arco-from Nature's way-this product after a while must be used for 7-15 days as directed the stop for 3,5,7,10 days then repeat as bottle suggests. It was trial and error with me. I also boil a cup of water and add a 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda-without aluminum. If you have other types of cancer you can use cat claw from The Vitamin Shop and use as directed but you can not use cat claw if you have Leukemia because it might make the leukemia worse but I used Pau d Arco and it worked. \nI also used tumeric. I used vitamin C Nature's made brand and cranberry pills by Nature's bounty and last but not least chaga mushrooms by Nature's way. Even though the super greens that I took has chaga mushrooms taking an added chaga mushrooms only by this brand works. I've learned with trial and error. \nDisclosure you must check with your doctor before taking anything period This is not FDA approved. This is not meant to cure anyone from anything. I am not a doctor and do not profess to be one.\n\nWatch on YouTube: Bill Gate's Eugenics project \nAnd the video: \"Anonymous- geoengineered clouds\" this is part of getting us sick and the Elite profiting of of us. \nLook up \"Anonymous- that Georgia guidestones. These Elite have the audacity to brag on these stones that they paid a lot of money for to kill us and get rid of us meanwhile making tons of profit.. Bill Gates and the elite are part of that program. Forget about who they say paid for these stones, I believe it's Bill Gates and the elite. \n\nThen look at the video of \"Vice-killing cancer\" they get rid of a man stage four brain cancer by immune therapy and scientists that I talk to and biologists tell me that they can get rid of most cancers within 7 weeks by immune therapy and also stem cell therapy, meanwhile they still use chemotherapy and radiation to our loved ones including children and this is barbaric and should be against the law. the biotech engineers told me that the only reason why they're still using chemotherapy and radiation is because of the profit they're making with chemotherapy and radiation and people should be in prison behind this. \nWe've been giving money for cancer research and all they've done is found out what causes cancer and they're putting it in the air we breathe with these geoengineered clouds and in our water in our food period our fruits and vegetables have carcinogens in them with these chemicals that they're using and they're saying it's to keep the bugs away from our fruits and vegetables and yet their carcinogens that give us cancer. \nI am putting my life on the line but I am 62 years old and I fought cancer naturally and these Crooks will not shut me up because I feel sorry for the young people that are getting vaccinated and they are giving us the illnesses that we're suffering from by all these things that I've mentioned above and vaccines. \nThe americanfrontlinedoctors.com the people that publish the autism magazine, Dr Bartlett MD from Texas, Dr Buttar, Dr Shiva need to be used in a lawsuit against these Crooks.\nThey are ALL incarcerated without bars WITH THIS VIRUS, WITH OUR RENTS AND MORTGAGES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO HIGH PERIOD THIS IS ALL A FORM OF CONTROL PEOPLE AND WE MUST FIGHT AGAINST THE ELITE THAT ARE UNDOING LAWS THAT WE HAVE PASSED TO HELP US WITH LESS TAXES, ETC.\nThey have Syrian and Latino children incarcerated right now and this must stop. They are trying to VACCINATE us all to make us sick and this vaccine is the MARK OF THE BEAST and We Believers must push the devil's plan back. We must not be sleeping and we are. Wake up and start a lawsuit against this VACCINATIONS for profit and give us illnesses, they are suppressing this information. \nVice- Killing Cancer:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FlK-PeCfezM\n\nProphecy and the times we are in right now: Wake up!

{"cid": "UgyAnFk12PxD3V2R_1V4AaABAg", "text": "It would be interesting to know what happened in the Arctic during the 10,800 BCE abrupt climate change. We know there were two ice sheets - smaller Cordilleran and bigger Laurentide on North America. The Laurentide perhaps 3 - 4 km thick at some places. \r\n\r\nThere was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.\r\n\r\nAdjusted quote: \"Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ‚àº9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ‚àº10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.\"\r\n\r\nIf interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ‚àº9% of world terrestrial biomass on ‚àº10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km¬≤ in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps CO2 released by burning of ‚àº9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ‚àº10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. \r\n\r\nThere is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.\r\n\r\nWhat mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?\r\n\r\nOne simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. \r\n\r\nRecent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. \r\n\r\nThe paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w\r\n\r\nImpact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. \r\n\r\nThere are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // \r\n\r\nIt is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible \"string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)\r\n\r\nIf you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000‚Äâm‚Äâin diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. An encounter with such a million-km-wide debris cluster would be thousands of times more probable than a collision with a 100-km-wide comet or a 10-km asteroid.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "George Davidson", "channel": "UCtyV7Beit_SWdT2KNr1vfyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTx4xXk1jpkfSZ8o717Z5OWTte0w6J1Mh0riw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugyd4Q6MnWOwfZpayJN4AaABAg", "text": "The truth is, TERRAFORMING via GEOENGINEERING / WEATHER MODIFICATION and anthropogenic overuse of POLLUTANT SULFATE AEROSOLS is our most prolific problem, NOT C02/carbon emissions...so why are we discussing FOSSIL FUELS (FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION; AEROSOLS) and CLIMATE CHANGE without the most significant denominator(s)?!?!\r\nThe potential NEGATIVE effects to control Earth's temperature by TERRAFORMING our planet...SPRAYING/INJECTING small AEROSOL PARTICLES into the STRATOSPHERE, is NOT being diligently characterized! Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are recognized by the IPCC as the MAIN SOURCE of \"uncertainty in present radiative forcing and climate models.\"\r\nWhy not share the truth, relevant facts and, EMPIRICAL DATA instead of BS \"settled science\" of causal inferences, obtained from the ARRHENIUS FORMULA for CO2 (only 0.04% of atmosphere), then apply that change of temperature to the WHOLE [global] CLIMATE SYSTEM?!?!?\r\nEMPIRICAL DATA has been collected, and connected in new ways to give a COHERENT, and LOGICAL illustration, to better understand our ATMOSPHERE, and CLIMATE SYSTEM...and how human manipulation via CLIMATE ENGINEERING, and POLLUTANT AEROSOLS affects the ENTIRE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM.\r\nNucleation of new AEROSOL particles via 'gas to particle conversion' has been studied for 50 years and is responsible for around one-half of global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which affect Earth‚Äôs radiation balance via AEROSOL-CLOUD interactions. The involvement of oxidized organic molecules in the process, alongside SULPHURIC ACID, was proposed in early studies and has been WELL-ESTABLISHED for some time.\r\nThe truth is, that human deposition of SULFURIC ACID via stratospheric GEOENGINEERING with SULFATE AEROSOLS, PERTURBATED (ie. heated) in our atmosphere, resulting in Secondary Organic AEROSOLS (SOAs), and combining with carbonaceous (PFOS) AEROSOLS...both, major component of our FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION, and the most likely contributing factor to CLIMATE CHANGE!!!\r\nThe truth is, that human [anthropogenic] sources of ATMOSPHERIC SULFUR OXIDES, including SULFURIC ACID deposition from STRATOSPHERIC CLIMATE ENGINEERING utilizing SULFATE POLLUTANT AEROSOLS and burning of fossil fuels, accounts for 75% to 80% of the HUMAN PRODUCTION of SULFUR OXIDES, in our AIR...the US ALONE, releases about 20 MILLION TONS of SULFUR DIOXIDE into our air, EACH YEAR...to put it into perspective, the large eruption of the volcanic Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, released between 15 and 30 MILLION TONS.\r\nThe truth is, that THERMAL DIFFUSION of CO2 shows it LOSES the ENERGY, absorbed almost instantaneously, leaving NO PLACE for any kind of STORAGE of THERMAL ENERGY by CO2, in our ATMOSPHERE! SUN ANGLE, which affects BACK RADIATION through WATER VAPOR, increases ATMOSPHERIC TEMP...the effect of BACK RADIATION through WATER VAPOR, is as high as 200 TIMES that of CO2, and WORKS CONVERSELY. Therefore, CO2 has a NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT (if any) on ATMOSPHERIC TEMP and CLIMATE...limiting its consumption will have, as NEGLIGIBLE of an effect!\r\nThe truth is, the planet has shown itself to be FAR LESS sensitive to increases in CO2 than the CLIMATE MODELS suggest, and much more sensitive to CLIMATE  ENGINEERING our ATMOSPHERE,  INJECTING AEROSOLS/POLLUTANTS, AND OTHER CHARGED PARTICLES (to include military/civilian rockets, craft/vehicle's and munitions exhaust/pollutants as particles) comprised of METALS AND TOXIC CHEMICALS, such as BARIUM, NICKLE CARBONYL, SULFUR OXIDES, SULFUR HEXAFLURIDE, BROMOTRIFLUOROMETHANE, etc...to then PERTURBATE these POLLUTANT AEROSOL particles into our ATMOSPHERE...utilizing HIGH POWER RADIO WAVES (HAARP, Arecibo Arecibo, EISCAT, Tromso, etc.) from SPACE, and GROUND STATIONS! Consequently, creating Secondary Organic AEROSOLS (SOAs), combined with CARBONACEOUS (PFOS) AEROSOLS...both, major component of our FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION, and the most likely contributing factor to CLIMATE CHANGE!!!\r\nThe trick of climate doomsayers is to draw their conclusions, obtained from the ARRHENIUS FORMULA for CO2 (only 0.04% of atmosphere), and then apply that change of temperature to the WHOLE [global] CLIMATE SYSTEM; this is BAD SCIENCE, at best...closer to FRAUD! Is the ATMOSPHERE ONLY composed of CO2...then why CLAIM the change of temperature of a mass, of TRACE GAS CO2, now becomes the change in temp of the ENTIRE, GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM?!?! Even if Arrhenius was right, ANY CHANGE obtained from his formula, is EXCLUSIVELY a change of temperature of the MASS of CO2, NOT of the ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE!!!\r\nThe truth is, SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) itself is a POLLUTANT, and major culprit in the deposition of ACID RAIN, and our CLIMATE CHANGE. SO2 is a dense, colorless, TOXIC, non-flammable gas, which oxidizes, via several chemical pathways, to SULFUR TRIOXIDE (SO3). At normal temperature and pressure, oxygen-rich SO3 is liquid...however, it is highly REACTIVE in the ATMOSPHERE, combining with WATER VAPOR/droplets to produce SULFURIC ACID DEPOSITION (H2SO4), known better as ACID RAIN! The source of the increased RAINFALL ACIDITY is NOT industrial emissions of SULFUR DIOXIDE alone, but  SULFATE AEROSOLS/POLLUTION often carried several hundred kilometers from where \"INJECTED.\"\r\nACID PRECIPITATION accelerates exchange processes at all surfaces, and causes leaching and mobilization of metal ions (especially Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, and Zn) from soils, and bedrock...both aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems have been affected by ACIDIFICATION, but the most OBVIOUS EFFECTS to date are on FRESHWATER systems.\r\nSince the 1960's, collection of rainfall at recording stations has led to the recognition that the CHEMISTRY OF THE RAIN HAS CHANGED...especially in its INCREASING SULFATE and hydrogen ion content...the pH DECREASED, and areas receiving ACIDIC RAIN have EXPANDED! INORGANIC ACIDITY contributes to the acidity of the rain, with SULFURIC ACIDS and nitric acids accounting for 95% of this acidity...SULFURIC contributing 2.5 to 3 times MORE than nitric! \r\nThe concentration of SULFUR DIOXIDE in clean air is around 0.01 ppm or less but in heavily \"sprayed\" (INJECTED; then PERTURBATED), POLLUTED urban environments, the concentration RISES to between 0.1ppm and 2ppm...10 to 200 FOLD INCREASE! Most fossil fuels (including aviation/jet fuel) have SULFUR, and when burned, COMBINES with oxygen to generate SULFUR OXIDES. \r\nExcess SULFUR OXIDE (SO2) has been linked to abnormally LOW OZONE LEVELS...SO2 DEPLETES the OZONE LAYER by reducing the solar flux it absorbs, between 180 nm-390 nm...the same range for the photolysis of O2, which is NECESSARY for OZONE production..since photolysis is reduced, OZONE production is also REDUCED!\r\nThe truth is, over exposure to SULFUR can DAMAGE the internal ENZYME SYSTEMS of humans and animals. SULFUR can also cause IRRITATION of the eyes, and throat when INHALED, while in the GASEOUS PHASE. Due to the possibilities of DESTRUCTION, of the SULFUR BONDS, the DAMAGING EFFECTS of SULFUR is mostly BRAIN DAMAGE...through malfunctioning of the HYPOTHALAMUS, and DAMAGE to the NERVOUS SYSTEM. Research has indicated, SULFUR can cause SERIOUS VASCULAR DAMAGE in veins of the BRAINS, the HEART and KIDNEYS...these tests have also indicated, certain forms of SULFUR can cause FETAL DAMAGE, and CONGENITAL EFFECTS...MOTHERS can even CARRY SULFUR POISONING over to their CHILDREN, through BREAST MILK!\r\nThe truth is, most SCIENTISTS studying our CLIMATE are \"EXPERTS\" in only a SMALL AREA, and NOT AWARE of Earth‚Äôs OVERALL CLIMATE SYS...nor of the endless RESEARCH studies, PROJECTS and implementations of different technologies/techniques being developed and utilized. \r\nThe truth is, existing international law only imposes a few PROCEDURAL DUTIES, on States who are responsible for CLIMATE ENGINEERING field research...as well as a handful of particular prohibitions, and constraints. These CLIMATE ENGINEERING / GEOENGINEERING methods pose a FAR GREATER RISK to humans, and the environment...more than any current law/regulation could curtail...and far, FAR BEYOND any WISHFUL outcome, associated with manipulating our CLIMATE SYSTEM!!!\r\nBottom line (AKA \"THE TRUTH\"); stratospheric GEOENGINEERING with SULFATE AEROSOLS, is the most prolific and significant factor, in our Secondary Organic AEROSOL (SOA and PFOS) FINE-PARTICLE-POLLUTION, and our CLIMATE CHANGE!\r\nSTOP WITH THE DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN TO PUSH A CAP-AND-TRADE, CARBON CREDIT/TAX FRAUD...AND START TELLING THE TRUTH!!!\r\nhttps://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/ \r\nhttps://unoda-web.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/documents/library/A-C1-PV2088.pdf", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "getreza", "channel": "UCIG6QTs3t6J2UIYnuAQ4ehA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT_bZNWA4AA6Uwgy0LrtBS3-P_oRQCnEnkyVg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgztlaLz41RPng1QYFZ4AaABAg", "text": "It's the measure of a collectively sick society when the concept of \"geo engineering\" is more socially acceptable than something like drastically reducing consumption and production of non-necessary items (e.g. A thousand different model of cars with a new model every year, a thousand different phones, etc) and production includes voluntarily controlling our population.\n\nFirst of all, there is a major delusion and myth that is a large hindrance to rationally tackling this crisis, and that is the myth of \"techno-optimism\", namely how 99% of people, despite absolutely zero empirical evidence to suggest its even possible, walk around ignorantly believing that technology will miraculously solve this issue, all the while, ironically forgetting that technology, especially short sighted techno-fixes, are what largely created this crisis to begin with.  The issue goes much deeper than that however, down to the very basis of civilization itself.\n\nWithout exception, every single civilization since agriculture began 10,000 years ago, has collapsed and largely due to, if not entirely due to, environmental degradation, and it's only hubris that makes us believe our civilization is any different.  It's anthropology 101 (I have a bachelor's in anthropology, PhD in molecular neuropharmacology that I recently completed), that civilization cannot exist without agriculture, and that as far as we know, we've yet to see a single example in all of civilized history, of a truly sustainable means of Agriculture.  For instance, soil samplestaken from layers predating the Spanish invasion of Central America demonstrates conclusively that thrle Aztec had just about completely destroyed the nutrients and productive capacity of their soil and that had the Spanish never arrived, their civilization most likely would have collapsed like the majority of civilizations, because of environmental degradation.  We know now that our modern agriculture has destroyed the soil on an even more thorough level to the point of rendering our soil basically as dead material in which we have to spray petri-chemicals upon to even get crops to grow (and BTW, organic agriculture, which has no proof of being sustainable in the longterm, cannot come close to feeding the world's excessive population).  What this demonstrates is that whether zero technology is utilized, or all the advanced technology we have today is used, Agriculture CANNOT BE RENDERED SUSTAINABLE. If civilization cannot exist 2ithout agriculture, then it follows that civilization itself is inherently unsustainable.  So you see, this crisis must force us to question the very underlying myths of our civilization, namely that we're someone different or apart from a history of civilization failing without exception, and the myth of linear human progress.  On another level, we also have to ask whether civilization and technology have been a NET gain for our species. For example, everyone likes to defer to medical science as an example 9f civilization and its benefits, but that medical science only applies to those who can afford it first of all, and if that medical science requires a destructive apparatus that has completely poisoned our air, food, and water and has unleashed an epidemic of industrial diseases like cancer than we cannot cure even when you can afford it, can that really be considered a NET benefit.... When medical science cannot even solve the side effects produced by its own creation?\n\nI strongly sugge anyone doubting me to take five minutes and Google an essay by Jared Diamond (author of the famous book \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\") called \"The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race\" which scientifically lays out how civilization hasn't been a net benefit to our physical as well as mental health, has not made us happier, doesn't make us more materially affluent (a book called \"The Original Affluent Society\" by anthropologist Marshall Sahlins makes this point in detail) and has basically destroyed the long term viability of our species.\n\nBasically, we need to drop any notions that we can somehow solve the greatest threat facing our species and somehow maintain our egregiously excessive and illogical way of life too... We can either have a viable, sustainable existence or our precious iPhone, but not both....

{"cid": "UgxE2pZPntZVdrR3_nl4AaABAg", "text": "Geoengineering is a stellar example of the ignorant, religious-like faith and techno-optimism that has so many incorrectly believing that technology will miraculously solve the inevitable environmental crisis when it absolutely will not and there's absolutely zero empirical evidence to suggest otherwise.  First off, when a society is more willing to resort Geoengineering, yet another techno fix in a long line of techno fixes that created the environmental crisis to begin with, than to simply reduce consumption and production (perhaps the two easiest and guaranteed methods of tackling this issue), there's a profound disturbance in our thinking.\n\nThe undeniable fact is that since civilization first emerged with domestication 10,000 years ago, literally every civilization prior to ours has collapsed and largely due to, if not entirely due to, environmental degradation. It's only hubris, ignorance, and sloth that makes us believe we're any different. What that history of failure means though, is that as a species we have yet to identify any means of making civilized existence environmentally sustainable.  Civilization cannot exist without agriculture, and unfortunately agriculture is inherently sustainable, as whether there's absolutely zero advanced technology involved as in ancient civilizations, or all the advanced technology involved as with the present, we are incapable of making agriculture sustainable and there's a growing consensus among scientists that NOTHING can ever make agriculture environmentally sustainable... Meaning civilization itself can and will never be sustainable.  And despite the completely unfounded belief in many that a technology will miraculously solve this problem, the truth is that technology CANNOT solve this problem and in fact has created it.\n\nFor instance, there's literally not enough lithium on the entire planet to convert all the vehicles ALREADY IN EXISTENCE to electric power, let alone for future production.\n\nThere's literally not enough fine grade silica of the quality required to create all the solar panels necessary just to meet CURRENT electrical demand.  And even if we  had the silica necessary, we'd have to cover every usable surface of the earth in those solar panels just to meet CURRENT electrical demand... Meaning there'd be no land left for growing food.\n\nSo you see, no amount of green energy or technology will solve this problem, the only thing that will solve it is a profound, radical and fundamental questioning and reassessment of every facet or our current existence, including such ideas as voluntary population control and asking whether the capitalist paradigm of infinite economic expansion and production can realistically exist on a planet and reality limited by finite resources.

{"cid": "UgwTGqgzRk7s7eejBEF4AaABAg", "text": "Also as experienced by the Vikings when settling in Greenland around 1000 years ago, there are undeniable scientific proof that global warming is a cyclical phenomenon, partly as explained by the sun's irradiance and the Milanovitch cycles, precision of equinox, etc. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/4GUcn07enz4\n\nIf it is mostly related to human made CO2, IPCC's scientists need to explain why are the ice-caps on Venus melting, and why is Mars and Pluto warming up? The common nominator is Sun irradiance, the difference is that there are no human created CO2.\n\nYes, it is not being denied that we recently are witnessing record high CO2 levels in the atmosphere. This may well stem from the increased temperature, releasing stored CO2 from the oceans. \n\nBlaming humans for the global warming, however, is FRAUDULENT and CONSPIRATORY. If human history proves anything, then it is that the future as a rule proves mainstream science WRONG. \n\nTrue science serves humanity by moving boundaries, creating new frontiers. While in the hands of a global conspiratory power elite science turns fraudulent and suppressive through bribery.\n\nLike what we currently are witnessing, a new global climate religion is being socially engineered, hatched by a conspiratory power elite operating at the core of UN.\n\nThe prophet being a well spoken mentally disoriented child, lies and fearmongering being the gospel, pseudoscience it's saviour, politicians and main stream media the disciples, while a geopolitical power elite acting as the hidden God. \n\nThose in denial of natural variations of the global climate are the first victims. But the real victims are those unaware of the unprecedented conspiracy in modern times, now taking place, namely the precursor to the long planned New World Order. \n\nUN's Agenda 21 is sought financed through ever increasing taxes on energy, a modern day 'indulgence' ultimately aimed at bringing worldwide poverty, starvation and elimination of 80% of the global population (look up: 'the Georgia Guide Stone'). The 'lucky' 20% is planned to serve as slaves to the one world government. \n\nIt follows the well-known blueprint of the old Hegelian dialectics:\n\n1. Engineer a problem (i.e. global warming) \n2. Harvest a reaction (fear of extinction) \n3. Introduce solutions (CO2 taxation)\n\nFollowing the perpetual war on terrorism, global warming appears being a 'noble' cause of war that may easily engage people, especially when the brainwashing starts in kindergartens and primary schools. \n\nIt is about supressing and dividing generations of people by creating existential fear. Thus becoming easy pray for the dynasty blood-line families¬†and their controllers. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/iX13Dx-7Zko\nhttps://youtu.be/hr1hisvjoAI\nhttps://youtu.be/5rtRL0vvUBQ\nhttps://youtu.be/1uxJoOekxMI\nhttps://youtu.be/xasfYpvVMM0\n\nThese have systematically been suppressing advanced none-polluting quantum based energy technologies, first introduced by Nichola Tesla 100 years ago. Being eliminated from the history books, few are aware that he actually harnessed free energy from the air via an antenna, powering his electric car without need of charging. In doing so, he was breaking the fraudulent law of physics. \n\nBeing a grave threat to the establishment, like D. Rockefeller, and his company Standard Oil (now, ExxonMobil), Rotschild, JP Morgan, and so on, he had to be stopped. Since, humanity have been stuck to primitive, fossil fuel dependent technologies - all controlled by these. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/klXj198vY4A\nhttps://youtu.be/ecni9SjkWoM\nhttps://youtu.be/Nl5NW9KcMt0\n\n\"... we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States... If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\" \nDavid Rockefeller (1915-2017) \n\n\"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!\" \nMayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) \n\nClearly, the mere difference between conspiracy theory and reality is the awareness of the observer. \n\nOperating from the top of the power pyramid, they keep controlling science, financial, political, religious, educational, medical, civil, military and geopolitical institutions, as well as main stream media. Among those are the ones president Eisenhower, JFK and others warned about...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Gg-jvHynP9Y\nhttps://youtu.be/qvSD6If3zds\n\nAs a self-regulating living planetary entity Mother Earth would thrive tremendously with benign technological development. But¬† the hidden trough is that she also would thrive with substantial increased levels of CO2 as well. And so will we, as the nature will flourish and provide foods for an ever growing population. \n\nNow gullible and ignorant people are being brainwashed into ignoring the real dangers, namely pollution of our food, drinking water, air, rivers, seas, forests and land. Like the immune system attacking benign tissue in the case of auto-immune syndrome, the climate alarmists are led into attacking the social web of the global society. \n\nIn classrooms across the Western world, this essential plant food, the nurturing gas our collective human existence depend upon, which we exhale appr. 22 tons each annually, is currently being brainwashed into the minds of our children as being a pollutant, despite being a vital part of the photosynthesis that make our greens grow, thrive and produce fresh oxygen for us to survive in the polluted air. \n\nWe would have evolved past using fossil fuels long before nuclear fuel was invented. But since neither Rockefeller, Rotschild, JP Morgan, nor others could put a meter on Nicolas Tesla's abundantly and freely available quantum energy, it had to be eliminated and buried before rooted in the modern society.\n\nA century later, seen from Tesla's perspective, we have definitely not advanced by any measures of significance. Quite contrary, a gullible child now keep telling the world we got to return to medieval means of transport. While those in the know are simply demanding the release of the long kept forbidden technologies. Something like what a recently retired Air Force general talked about \"that can take us from one part of the planet to any other part within an hour.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31445/recently-retired-usaf-general-makes-eyebrow-raising-claims-about-advanced-space-technology\n\nThe future of non-pollutant energy does not come to us.

But what I am definitely saying is that various leftists factions around the globe have used it as a fulcrum to attack free market capitalism and advance the cause of power centralization and decimation of individual freedom. And the propaganda campaign is fierce!! \n-\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the huge problems with most of the \"technologies\" proposed in this documentary. For instance. If you run a HUGE fan to suck air into a system to comb out C02, just the power consumed by the fan would likely generate more carbon than the Rube Goldberg device is removing. And then, if any energy is spent in some sort of catalytic or heat based extraction process, MORE carbon footprint. And are any heavy metals or other toxins being used in the process? Because it's going to be a gargantuan effort if it's going to make ANY difference. \n-\n\nThis all points to the need for clean energy production, achievable through LFTR nuclear reactors ... which ironically, this documentary didn't even touch on. - Why? POLITICS! \n\nLFTR technology is being developed by the Chinese, but the Western world is too steeped in cronyism to abandon Uranium based nuclear energy and fossil fuels and invest the billions it will take to get LFTR off the ground. - Once you can make clean power, you can run these goofy machines without the carbon feedback loop issue. -- So then, we'll just be left with the fairly obvious truth that despite how powerful man is, the Earth is a BIG PLACE and we lack the resources to affect this planet very much. -- Think about it. We'd need to run machines to effectively negate ALL OF MANS OTHER ACTIVITIES, THUS FAR!

Like having more Earth Quakes & much more Volcano Activities on the whole planet! (am not even mentioning Cosmic Gamma Rays fluctuation hitting the Earth in highs & lows) ... and they want to DENY all of that happens without human help without human interference ...\n\nSo who is the real climate denier and who is the climate-realist? ... The scale of non-human effects on Cyclical Climate Change is so vast and so big they decided to IGNORE all of it to demonize anyone who challenges their version of human climate effects. At the same time they willfully ignore different types of overt & covert GEOENGINEERING projects creating artificial local weather extremes and blame it in CO2 what plants breathe for f sake!\n\nThey even deny Global Cooling & Warming (Change) trends happened for millions of years when we had no human created pollution of any kind. The MASSIVE FRAUD (and systematical brainwashing) that is going on is NOT only how much the scale is we humans affect the climate trend also how much we suppose to \"correct\" it with our so called CO2 emissions that ALL plants need to breathe! ... This \"Global Carbon Tax\" aka \"Global Governance\" Agenda is connected to A.I. 5G Smart Surveillance Grid Micromanaging everybody to \"Save The Earth\" BS ... Pushing for a Totalitarian Collectivism punishing everybody who is against it ... Just study what happens in Chinese \"Social Credit System\" (Black Mirror Episode going for real!) that soon will be implemented everywhere between now and 2030. You losing privileges if you do not bow down (comply) to their Orwellian system based upon massive lies & deception. Tyrannical Agenda 21 is real and ignoring it will not make it go away. You can ignore all what I just said but you can not ignore the consequences of what is to come. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to see what their true motives are.\n\nCheers,\nJohn Kuhles", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "UnslaveHumanity", "channel": "UCMKOcK17io6sRGl-2Q8G7vQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlI1OxvwPRpha5imcFi4p98Zy7kPJd3YC_RToV=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugxu8aWT4ZrvcEHfTMt4AaABAg.92wXZfdP6wq9F2amqoTjFy", "text": "Actually, the timber industries improve forest growth by removing dead trees with Root Rot which will spread and kill surrounding trees. The removal of both dead and healthy trees maintains overgrowth and ultimately prevents mass forest fires that would otherwise destroy entire forests spanning several acres. Like in California for example. Their laws restricting timber industries from collecting fallen and standing dead trees and reducing the number of healthy trees they're permitted to cut down per hectare has had terrible consequences we've observed over the past 2-3 decades. Besides, CO¬≤ has increased L.A.I. (leaf area index) worldwide by 70% over just 30 years. CO¬≤ was on a steady decline before the industrial revolution. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere was reduced by about 90% during the last 150 million years. If this trend had continued CO2 would have inevitably fallen to levels that threaten the survival of plants, which require a minimum of 150 ppm to survive. Considering the atmosphere was down to 280 ppm, pre-industrial revolution. I'd say we're damn lucky we discovered the benefits of burning fossil fuels.

That makes no sense. \nI will use a cancer as example. If you determine someone has cancer, you have to act or not act. By not acting, you have a slim to 0 chance of survival because the cancer will grow and spread. If you do act, you have the choice of how. Chemo may be successfully but may also hurt you too if the chemo is damaging a lot of your living cells as well. Knowing all that, the best choice of action is always to act. The pain of going through chemo can be analogous to our country adjusting to closer to a zero emission nation. \nLastly, I completely disagree with the premise that the government owns the scientists. If that was so, trump would be able to demand that the climate change is labeled a hoax. The scientific community may rely on grants from the government, but 1. its not the only source of funding. 2. they publish what the evidence supports. 3. the consensus is worldwide independent of one countries agenda or motive. \n\n\nI find it laughable that you believe the whole world is part of a conspiracy. And your choice of red flags is just a test on a plan Z when shit hits the fan, the most desperate of solutions. Has planting trees alone helped? Just look at the data on the CO2 increase and production by countries around the world. Theres measured data of CO2 in the atmosphere and in the cold waters that can store them.

We all know the environment is precious, that it is beautiful, that it is important. A lot of us who argue about it, for an example in my country Australia, climate change protesters stand in the streets, blocking traffic in important sectors of the city. It is causing conflict, and the conflict is destroying the environment conversation. The truth is, climate change is real. Whoever denies a change in our climate is at a loss.The Earth is changing, but they are not telling us why. Greta Thunberg is one of many puppets who is being used to push the agenda. Just search UN Agenda 2030. For some time now, they want to weaponize the weather, and tax us for it, every step of the way. Through the means of HAARP technology, which involves reflecting heat off the ionosphere, they can shift and change temperature, wind flow, everything, and with metals in the air that they spray on us, the chemtrails we see in the sky, 'death dumps' Ted Gunderson called them, this technology works much better. When you look up at the sky for long enough, you begin to see small spark like spots in your sight. You can see it in the air, and we are all breathing it in. The media will never cover this topic. Cooling the Earth is the cover story. Even this video, completely dismissing the term chemtrails. Vice is controlled garbage. The elite who are behind the oil industries, the banks, the corporations, do not want to change. They will try to bend the Earth to their will, and make it change for them.

Geoengineering has been being carried out for decades. Do keep in mind that blocking out the sun's rays will only serve to make the planet even colder and the growing environment even less favorable for plants and food crops as the planet continues to cool. The planet is NOT warming. CO2 dors NOT cause any significant warmjng. C02 is a trailing indicator, NOT a leading one. Increases in CO2 only follow increases in temperature. Please people READ the science. And READ Agenda 2030!  Sustainable development is a code word for NWO and total control over all humans and global resources. It's incredibly frustrating watching humans beg for their own demise en mass. And the ocean is NOT rising (try taking real measurements). Vice needs to actually do research and understand what the F you are actually talking about. And stop dumping toxic aluminum, barium, and strontium on the planet. CO2 is plant food. CO2 levels are VERY low at 450 ppm fir plantlife. Maybe you idiots can figure out a way to completely eliminate ALL CO2 in the atmosphere and along with it all biological life on the planet. And there are periods in Earth's history when the poles were ice-free long before humans were here. At least learn what the normal Earth cycles are. Or is the point of all the warming non-sense to line the pockets of a few by taking advantage of the majority that don't bother to read or can't understand the real science.

Jobs never ending through climate initiatives aimed at adaptation, shoreline stabilization, environmental renewal. Atmospheric solar reflective engineering and direct air capture represent the nexus of militaristic and corporate opportunism for a problem that cannot be solved by high tech engineering alone. Negative Emissions technology that proposes to sequester carbon \"underground\" through down hole pumping ignores the fact that CO2 is actually needed by plants to grow at the surface, to produce carbohydrates, to build soil carbon through photosynthesis. If we don't lower the pH of the ocean through land applications of the basalt and other alkaline rock dusts through mineralization climate stabilization doesn't happen, no matter how many solar panels and wind mills we build. We need to intervene in the upward spiral of the carbon cycle, reversing 200 years of industrial emissions. We can do this through active land management and maritime restoration.

That's all part of what will be required as we give birth to the first global civilization\".\n\n‚Äú World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.‚Äù - Jacques-Yves Cousteau, oceanographer and humanist, The UNESCO Courier, Nov. 1991, page 12 \n\n \"The commitment of government to deal with the population issue is of course essential...There are many ways to make the death rate Increase. Action will necessitate a propaganda campaign of global proportions. ‚Äù - Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense, New Solidarity, March 30, 1981\n\n ‚ÄúOne of the least understood strategies of the world revolution now moving rapidly toward its goal is the use of crisis as a major means of obtaining the consent of the people who will be subjects of the New World Order.‚Äù ‚ÄìK.M. Heaton, National Educator \n\n\"Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.‚Äù ‚ÄìDr. Henry Kissinger, Evians, France, 1991 \n\n‚ÄúThe truth of the matter is that you do have those standby provisions, and the statutory emergency plans are there whereby you could, in the name of stopping a terror or environmental threat, apprehend, invoke the military, and even arrest Americans and hold them in detention camps. ‚ÄìU.S. Representative Henry Gonzalez, Aug 29th, 1994", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "WizardofCause Hoc", "channel": "UCawDONb163npCxJhA7REq1g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTg5GSYqavKOiqXaFoKvCNSlQfp6JjL759OZQQM1Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This is silly to think that everyone can continue to consume more and we will simply use technology to fill in the blanks. As an electrical engineer, I do understand. Take heating for example; try to heat your big@$$ house explicitly with electricity, and then also add heating your hot water to the mix. If you have a 1500W (which all real heaters are) heater in every room and have, say, 8 rooms in the home (3 bed, 2 bath, kitchen, dining room, living room), that's 12000 watts just for heating rooms, then the 9000 watts for your water tank. That's 21000 watts for heating alone. Most solar setups for homes don't exceed 10000 watts. Also, homes consume energy most when the sun is not up, meaning you have to store the amount of excess energy in batteries, or a form of potential energy other than that... Now I know that heaters and hot water aren't always on, but say if they were to all come on at once, you would need a 175 Amp service feed coming into your home on 120V (actually 87.5A on three phase 240V) and would need... wait for it... to draw 1750 amps from a 12V battery setup, and on a more practical setup 437 amps from a 48 V setup.

None of these technologies have any chance of just being slightly relevant when the culture and attitude of people does not change towards this problem. In their niche they focus on engineering solutions to lessen or eventualy reverse the impact the climate change. That's what they can contribute. There are other people to consider socio-economic, cultural and political aspects of it. And of course we need all of those to make great progress in the end. I don't see why they would think of their solutions as the only or most valuable one. Actually I don't feel like they think like that at all.

What I understand through my years upon years of University is that 90% of engineers don't actually do the work because they intrinsically believe in the work they do; they do it for the money. So many of my peers didn't talk about what they would do after they left University and how they could impact the world; they talked about how much money they could make once they left school. They weren't interested in saving the planet; they were interested in buying cars and properties. I think it's cool that these old engineers are trying to help out now in their senior years, but we don't need a few octogenarians donating their time; we need tens of thousands of young engineers dedicating their lives to the cause. They won't though because there just isn't money in saving the world.... yet. I know everyone is going to jump down my throat over that last comment: don't you know how much money is in solar panels and wind turbines!!!??? To which I reply: don't you know that the video game industry is far bigger than either of these industries, that the USA spends around $700 billion every year on its military (and the world about $2 trillion); the global oil industry is worth nearly $1.7 trillion while the global Solar panel industry is worth only about $50 billion. More engineers are going into the defense sector and into the petro-chemical industry.... so I would posit that engineers are more aligned with destroying the world than saving it.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Northern Drone Werx", "channel": "UC6UFFRXL8aBC8_S3B8mvTrA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQUnScnZyERmw65eLWoVUWA8Mpj-aTUi7SU71QE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And arrive at a more accurate balance of understanding of the issue.\nThere are tough questions crying out to be asked about the feasibility of the near-immediate emissions cessation and arrival at negative-emissions that is being described as needed for stopping the warming and its feedback loops; and whether that would be sufficient even if in theory feasible. There are tough questions crying out to be asked about the probable actual consequences are of such catastrophic reductions, which could include societal upheavals, leading to wars and greater emissions and abandonment of the whole program.  There are tough questions crying out to be asked about the actual meaning of the emission reductions programs, when they are at the same time obstructing and often shuttering nuclear energy, the most effective available method for emissions reductions. There are tough questions about the costs and energy needed for carbon capture and storage, suggesting it may become scalable only after we harness fusion energy to power it.\n Also, there are tough questions about the consequences of the failure to research, test, and implement solar radiation geoengineering (SAI-SRM) fast enough. What will be the effects, as the warming feedback loops keep operating? What would be the optimal timeframe for doing SAI-SRM , weighing the costs of further delay versus the costs of imperfect preparation? What have been the costs already of the long delay on testing and implementing it? Will further delay in the Western part of the world lead to incompetent and geopolitically competing SAI-SRM deployments by other countries? This risk of competing SRM programs is something that you treat, illogically, as if it were to be blamed on SAI-SRM research, rather than on its delay and the ideological pressures against ever doing it. The basics have been known of how to do SAI-SRM for decades.  It should be obvious that, as the warming continues and countries get more desperate, some are going to go ahead with it. If we keep dithering on it, the most desperate countries and least prepared countries will inevitably be the ones to go ahead with it. And then others really will take their own geoengineering measures in response. The only thing that could seem to stop this kind of competition is for the West to hurry up, start preparing seriously for doing it competently, and start building the needed international support to keep it to a single program. \nYou could be asking all these questions.

{"cid": "UgzSSzO_s-ngxJ6UBXh4AaABAg", "text": "The mindset of liberals who refuse to even consider the possibility that maybe we need to address the structural, systemic problems inherent to capitalism that drive not only emission of greenhouse gasses, but producing toxic chemicals that go into the water, air, and consumer products (Johnson & Johnson just was discovered for putting asbestos in their baby powder, a huge proportion of popular baby foods contain arsenic, Taco Bell cut their meat with silica and dusting agents‚Äî the list is endless‚Äî and then there‚Äôs the toxic waste and chemicals like C8 that get dumped into our water and end up in toxic concentrations in almost all of our bodies, rising cancer rates). Depleting vital resources, destroying important ecosystems and biomes, wiping out species so fast that we‚Äôre in a mass extinction event...\n\nIt‚Äôs important that we pursue technologies that can help‚Äî we MUST transition to a green energy infrastructure (we literally just can not afford to keep burning fossil fuels), and at the same time, we NEED to develop materials and devices that can suck a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere, because by all account we have to achieve net negative emissions (at this point within ~10-11 years) to stop climate change from spiraling out of control before it‚Äôs too late. And that‚Äôs all just to address climate change alone.\n\nIt‚Äôs delusional to pretend that we can address ALL of these myriad environmental crises without dealing with the systemic root of the systemic problem, or that you‚Äôll find some silver bullet like geoengineering that will make all this go away without us having to think about that aspect. And yet I‚Äôve never seen Vice, or CNN, or MSNBC, or Fox, or Vox, etc., do videos reporting on whether we should be coming up with an alternative to capitalism that won‚Äôt destroy the planet. I wonder why that is... Could it be because these are huge corporations owned primarily by wealthy (disproportionately billionaire/hundred-millionaire) investors, who are part of the tiny percentage of the population who profits ENORMOUSLY and enjoys a position of ruling class power & control over large swaths of the economy predicated on maintaining this system, even if it destroys us in the middle-to-long-term? Hmm. \n\nJust like the oil corporations place profit over the future of humanity and will continue to suck oil out of the ground and put it into the air until the day there‚Äôs none left, knowing fully well that it will be an end of days scenario if they do‚Äî all other corporations have the same kind of stake in maintaining capitalism as a mode of production, and to the extent that the structures, incentives, institutional imperatives, processes, and social relations of capitalism are causing our ecological catastrophes (I‚Äôd say they 80% of the source of the problem), by continuing to place short-term profits over human well-being, over the decent survival of the species, over sustaining the environment we live in, they are playing an instrumental role in the degradation of our future just like the oil companies. The role of media in this is unique, because when they‚Äôre the ones playing this role, the consequence is that they put out content that manipulates the masses into complacency, into not doing anything about it. The message is essentially ‚ÄúWell, if there‚Äôs a solution it‚Äôll be some scientists somewhere else making a new technology or geoengineering our way out of it‚Äî so just keep recycling your toilet paper tubes and shopping at ‚Äòeco-friendly‚Äô corporations and you‚Äôre doing all you can,‚Äù when the reality is that pursuing necessary social system/policy changes will very likely make or break our future.

Meaning, that capitalism and capitalist theories came first. So laughing them off as ‚Äú18th century‚Äù is pretty funny. Just like capitalist theory, anti-capitalist theory has been continuing to develop for the last 250 years. But you would have to actually have bothered to familiarize yourself with that body of work to know that. \n\nI absolutely agree that capitalism has some good qualities and has done some good things. Karl f*cking Marx agreed about that. What capitalists don‚Äôt have a theory or appreciation of is that capitalism was just one more step forward in a process of historical development that started with the rise of civilization and slave economies, through feudal economies, through capitalist economies, and there‚Äôs no reason to believe that process will stop there, any more than feudal lords were right to claim that anyone going on about capitalism were delusional idealists, and actually society would always be feudal. History is on the side of those who recognize that.\n\nThe unfortunate reality that your Pinkers and Miseses and Friedmans and Hayeks insist on putting on blinders to is that, along with the production of unprecedented wealth, capitalism has also produced an unprecedented form of mass poverty, where even in one of the richest countries of the world, a huge proportion of the population is below or barely skimming the surface of an already misleadingly low poverty line, where most people will go bankrupt if they have a single injury, illness, or other hospitalization because of a capitalist, for-profit healthcare industry. Capitalism is trending towards working poverty for many‚Äî a condition where even if they work full-time it‚Äôs not enough to survive. I know many people who are having to work 80-100 hours a week like this is Dickensian England, because real wages have been falling for 50 years under policies far more free-market oriented than the social democratic ones capitalism flourished under from the end of WWII to the early 70s. Capitalists as a class have been leveraging their political power to totally marginalize workers (the majority of people) from having political representation, they crushed the labor unions that enabled workers to even negotiate a decent standard of living. \n\nIf you actually develop a materialist analysis of capitalist institutions and how capitalism works, all of this, all the data we have to work with about how our economic history has unfolded, makes perfect sense. It all comes back to the social relations intrinsic to the capitalist class system, the profit motive... Right-wingers will come up with these mythologies where actually all that is just ‚Äúcrony capitalism‚Äù and the problem is ‚Äútoo much government,‚Äù but if you think like the major capitalists actually do‚Äî that paradigm completely breaks down. The fact is, if you‚Äôre a capitalist, you benefit from public policy that maximizes your profit (regardless on its effect on anyone and anything else). To shape public policy you need to control the state. So if you can afford to buy influence/control over the state, that‚Äôs what your rational self-interest dictates you should do, and that‚Äôs what they do. That is just the reality of what happens in capitalism based on the principles that make capitalism run. \n\nSetting mass poverty aside, setting aside the threat to democracy as the state inevitably gets subsumed by billionaires and multinational corporate conglomerations... Capitalism IS destroying the environment and driving climate change. Whatever you think about capitalism, if we let that happen then no amount of ‚Äúprosperity‚Äù or ‚Äútechnological innovation‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket efficiency‚Äù will matter, because it will ruin life as we know it. \n\nI have read many different capitalist theories. I have read many different anti-capitalist theories. I have read about the various alternatives. I‚Äôve done my due diligence and come to an informed conclusion. And in my experience, 98% of the people who make vacuous surface level arguments like the ones you‚Äôre making just don‚Äôt have a lot of frame of reference. They learned the most basic principles of Econ 101, they heard one particular version of capitalist theory and all the assumptions that go with it, and they just took that to be God‚Äôs truth, unquestionable science no different from physics. This is delusion and it is delusion largely brought on by dogmatism (an unwillingness to challenge or even recognize your own ideological assumptions, or even that those assumptions are ideological and not objective realities) and an unwillingness to actually expose themselves to opposing theories in good faith, with the genuine desire to arrive at the best possible understanding of the world. Most of the people who prattle on about how socialism means state control, and communism is totalitarianism, and capitalists/corporations/capitalism represent freedom and are totally at odds with the state, and that people who have contrary analyses just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt understand economics‚Äù hold those beliefs because they haven‚Äôt learned enough theories of capitalism to realize how much they don‚Äôt know, and how much the jury is still out on. Even within pro-capitalist spheres, you have neoclassicism, Austrian, Keynesian, social democratic... Many capitalists themselves disagree with your assumptions about capitalism.  But people in institutional roles of power as capitalists are bound by the need to compete, which means to maximize profit and accumulate capital, so even when they recognize the very real (and tbh in most cases obvious) problems I‚Äôm bringing up, they can‚Äôt act differently in their roles as CEOs or board members to solve these problems. And the people who control the state, who are financed by the wealthiest capitalists, their donors in our privately financed electoral system, so they can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt break out of that to solve these problems either. They both benefit from maximizing their own profits at our expense, and if that means driving us off a cliff as far as climate change is concerned, then that‚Äôs what will happen. Oil industrialists won‚Äôt stop of their own volition, and the corporate bag-men they pay to serve them in government won‚Äôt either. As long as we refuse to look at that reality, we‚Äôll edge closer to the point of no return and jeopardize all of our and our descendants‚Äô futures. \n\nThe only left-wing economic theory I see that has failed on a large scale for economic reasons has been the kind of state-capitalism that Leninist-derived authoritarian states have implemented‚Äî in the USSR, in China, etc.. But as a left-libertarian who opposes that and has a whole different theory of what we should be moving towards, I have no problem criticizing that‚Äî I find Leninism and it‚Äôs antecedents extremely destructive and counterproductive to the goal of achieving a stateless, worker-run society. It just installs a new ruling class, the class who controls the state, and puts them in charge of the economy.\n\nVarious historical left-libertarian movements have not failed because of economic inadequacy‚Äî in fact, studies of the kinds of worker co-ops that would make up a substantial part of a worker-owner economy show that they‚Äôre more resilient and in many instances more productive than corporations. These revolutions have virtually always been crushed by military force by states who didn‚Äôt want examples to emerge which demonstrate that people can live effectively, prosperously, and freely in the absence of coercive, exploitative, and authoritarian institutions and ruling classes. It was capitalist republics alongside fascist states and the Soviet Union who historically played the biggest roles in sniffing these movements, which had real potential, out. But we continue to learn from history and adapt, to understand how to better defend the seedlings of a decent future society.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you don‚Äôt see the suffering taking place because of the form and dynamics of capitalism, you have to be incredibly insulated from it, because it affects most of the population to some extent or another (many of them horrifically). But you‚Äôd have to be a billionaire to be that far removed from the reality most people face. Far more likely is that you‚Äôve just bought into the ruling class mythology: ‚ÄúOh, sure, there are (massive numbers of) people suffering and toiling in our economy... Bit it‚Äôs actually because of ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô government [an argument immediately debunked by history]. Or it‚Äôs okay because it wouldn‚Äôt been worse without capitalism, so we shouldn‚Äôt try to improve the systemic roots of the problems.‚Äù Or ‚Äúit‚Äôs all totally ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô when propertyless workers agree to work on someone else‚Äôs command for someone else‚Äôs profit because they know that if they don‚Äôt they‚Äôll starve/go homeless/get sick and die.‚Äù Nothing at all coercive about agreeing to serve someone because you know you‚Äôll die if you don‚Äôt. Totally free, ideal arrangement, that. But then, the same right-wing libertarians who buy that also often argue that a parent has every right to sell their child into slavery, and has no problem with the development of totally unaccountable private tyrannies which can do virtually whatever they want to rip workers, communities, and the environment we all depend on apart, because their ‚Äúright‚Äù to do so is the highest form of freedom.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Matthew Fodell", "channel": "UCie7vF-tG0ZWiznfT6x_aMA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTONdG5vEM6XIAWtJ82qQ70hejyC7WkYr3gDC4kMQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwYJZLRNKNqlJMSEgV4AaABAg", "text": "The obvious political, financial, and religious motives for spreading climate hysteria are the real drivers of our irrational anti-carbon policies, not science.   Apocalyptic doomsday religions have been popular since the dawn of man, and climate hysteria is an ancient phenomenon that has plagued our past.  Five hundred years ago the weather was so extreme that Europeans burned alive thousands of people accused of being \"weather witches.\" Through \"weather cooking\" they were believed to have caused terrifying storms that destroyed crops and killed farm animals. Only a few citizens objected to burning their neighbors and using torture to gain confessions. The dissenters believed that weather is controlled by Nature, not by man. If you express those exact sentiments today even United States senators and congressmen will brand you a \"denier,\" a term historically used in different forms by virtually all intolerant religions around the world.  See Dr. Baliunas on Weather Cooking (YouTube video).\r\n\r\n     Scientists ‚Äî devout true believers ‚Äî at NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC have been caught distorting data to increase our level of anxiety.  You can argue with science, but you cannot argue with religious fervor.  Thus, we see the Orwellian spectacle of Americans protesting ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù during record cold and snow, and after Niagara Falls froze two winters in a row.  Humans are 18.5% carbon by weight, eat carbon based food, and live in homes made with carbon.  A war against carbon is a war against the essential fuel of life our own families. \r\n\\\r\nPlease carefully read New Climate Discovery at http://renewable.50webs.com/Zeller.Nikolov.html  Think about it.

To be clear im not saying it can't be done, just that it isnt effective. Basically it's been known for the better part of the last century that pumping fluid or gas back into crust creats fissures in the rock that lead to quakes. Think fracking here, same concept. In order for the recapture to be effective Co2 needs to be held out of the atmosphere for thousands of years. Because these fissures are highly unstable they coukd leak Co2 constantly and that basically renders the whole process a wash. It becomes a big waste of effort time and money. \n\nHere's some literature:\n\nhttps://www.climatecentral.org/news/the-earth-shaking-consequences-of-burying-carbon-underground (there's a hyperlink in there with the actual source of the study done, but this article is a good read.)\n\nAlso I'd like to point out that there have been new feats accomplished in this field that do allow for safer forms of recapture and burial but none so far have proven to be able to work on a global scale and so although it might work in tandem with say a power plant, its not exactly a viable solution to climate change.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Mikerphone", "channel": "UCbLixUU_RaddvMgW2gUUOQw", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRKmie3rrS8OBhMjkwTpe78SVW8w7IF7oA8HROF=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Most potential solutions to climate change are impractical. But there are no simple or practical ideas to solving climate change.

Let's assume the Co2 is buried and there is a small chance that a fissure could cause a leak back into the atmosphere.

You guys might be aware that the majority of carbon that is removed from the atmosphere naturally is eventually converted via sunlight into particulate complex carbon molecules (through photosynthesis). Much of this carbon capture happens in the oceans, where CO2 dissolves into the ocean water and is converted into biomass by algeas and cyanobacteria, which then eventually sinks to the ocean floor (effectively sequestering it from the carbon cycle for billions of years). \n\n\nThe Carbon Engineering company is doing something similar; it is using the power of sunlight to convert gaseous carbon into more complex carbon molecules (in this case, fuel). What if, instead of fuel, we produce huge amounts of new biomass, which can then be spread into the oceans and sequestered (i.e. by sinking to the ocean floor, in a similar manner that happens naturally).", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "PhageLord", "channel": "UCifi3PVe0s9ZoS3PPiq2xCA", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSQUL_wreilYKLlvuQO58kxyXPBepC3qLGfkb4Z=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It becomes a lot clearer that failure is much more of a factor than the likelihood of success. Considering the massive amounts of resources that have to go into the implementation of something like this to meet a scale which could create any noticeable net positive diffrence in the atmosphere. We really need to sit back and do a lot of thinking on rates of success and the risk factors at play. I find that the risk of causing more earthquakes and high likelihood of leaking large amounts of co2 back into the atmosphere far outweighs the endevor into trapping supercritical co2 in the crust. \n\nIf more science comes out on the mineralization and subsequent solidification process. Then at that point im all ears on making this work as a viable solution. Because i do believe that there are practical low risk solutions to geo-engineering. Someone had already mentioned using biomass as a solution. There is a ton of research into that which looks very promising, but there is also a lot to be said about low orbit dispersions and other processes that could be immediately effective in at least cooling the earth. As long as the chemistry pans out, they could also be completely harmless. So why not? \n\nIn conclusion i would say we should always pursue multiple avenues of a solution even when some appear bleak. Though we shouldn't be so hasty to accept those which come with underpinning downsides and risks just because the clock has run out. In the end we may find that it wasted precious resources, time, and ultimately left us either where we were to begin with.

If you study history, you will find out that most of human history is filled with people trying to accomplish one thing and failing and simultaneously causing all kinds of problems in the mean time. A good example of this would be the Army Corp of engineers attempting to keep Niagara Falls from eroding too quickly, so they blocked off the US side of the falls, did a lot of \"engineering\" and ultimately all the work collapsed and was eroded by mother nature making a mess while the Canadian side of the falls just eroded naturally. Guess which side people consider the majestic natural beauty? (Hint, you'll almost always only see a picture of the Canadian side of Niagara Falls).\n\n2) Most of the CO2 on the planet is absorbed in and out of the oceans. What these clowns don't tell you is that atmospheric CO2 increases AFTER temperature increases according to the historical temperature records (proxy records for millions of years based on ice core samples for example). You're almost onto something in your last sentence. All of this CO2/climate change nonsense is really about money.\n\n3) Volcanic eruptions are natural and unstoppable. They are not good for humans if you're too close, other than that, they're just part of the planet's complicated natural processes that we will never be able to influence. They are a large source of CO2 emissions as well.\n\nThe thing to remember is that plants absorb CO2 as food. Greenhouses actually pump in CO2 to have better crop yields. The CO2/climate change hysteria has been going on for a long time under a lot of different names but it's generally all about people who are nihilistic, overestimate their own personal significance in the universe (in terms of affecting the entire world).

That's kind of a problem when you consider the fact that there is only one body of water on earth.

It was true.  He didn't lie.

I used to laugh whenever I would here someone be accused of working for the Oilagarchy because they had a different opinion on the reason for \"climate change\".  In any case, you can believe what you want as well.  That's ok with me.   Ultimately, time will tell.  All I know is that the US has seen 100 and 300 year records for cold and snow over the last two winters.  We aren't even into winter 2019/2020 yet and we have once again broken records for cold and snow.  Repeatedly.  So if the earth is actually warming i guess that means more cold and snow.  In fact, the NYT carried a headline the other week that went, \"Why Global Warming Means More Cold And Snow\".    Wow.  lol.     That's what we call, \"doublespeak\".  \n\n\nps.... I have been called an environmental extremist ever since presiding over the E.L.F. at UW Madison.  I have spent a great deal of time living off-grid and even 8 years vegan.

Condensate evaporates after about 20 seconds.  The persistent trails started in the late 90's, when the geoengineering started.  Water vapor clings to itself and doesn't smear out like powder, except under exceptionally windy conditions.  (makes rounded clouds).  Water vapor doesn't precipitate unless it is dense, which looks dark.  I have seen many white chemtrails precipitating along their edges.  Jet engines don't turn their condensation off and on, like the chemtrails that appear as dashes (I noticed they won't do that anymore though, it was too obvious).  So, there are some answers.
