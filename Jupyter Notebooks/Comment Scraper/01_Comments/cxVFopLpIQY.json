High frequency.\n\nTerra hz generation Terra hz can be easily achieved with occillator settings of squares. In dual channel frequency generators. This because a leftwards gliding square A. Hitting a stable square B. When both signals are combined. Will make a massive frequency at double volt when the two squares touch. Followed by a sweep through the radio band to base frequency of the squares.\n\nThe effects in the Terra hz and above range. Look to be biologicly dangerous and radioactive. Photon particles.\n\nShorting A and B to conductor. Setting the smallest increments of the two squares together. Like 10.00 mhz with 9.999 999 mhz. Will give you 10 times frequency pr new 9. In this example 100 thz. If setting fore instance 473 thz. Setting A to 10 mhz. B would be set at 9.999 999 473 mhz.\n\nGeneration of this type of signals may be able to interfere with IR by modulation. Like the 400 thz. Global warming ionosphere IR block frequencies.\n\nHigh t hz and p hz is dangerous. Meaning biologicly dangerous even at occ low volt. Resulting in radiation effects. A Geiger counter held near the short wire will respond.\n\nSince two shorted wires fed A and B. Can be injected into a human. The high range p hz. May allow x ray treatment direct inserted into cancer cells. Because of x ray capable electron volt. Has potential to counter brain frequency capabilites . In mid 80s russian capabilities.\n\nTo make possible continues signal at frequency. The two squares or two same waveforms must be restarted simultaneously. Synced. Fore not having the shorter pulse glide.\n\nDesinfection may be possible with UVC. Generated from radio. Virus resonance may be possible with peta hz at diameter. Can be counterproductive. Frequencies is set at virus diameter nm. Fore heating virus.\n\nSplitting of CO2.\n\nBy setting oxygen radius or diameter.\n\nNOTE CARBON ATOM RADIUS LETHAL TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS.\n\nSplitting of H2O. Fore regeneration of atmosphere pressure. By rf to cloads. Note ozon depletion potential.\n\nFore oxygen resonance.\n\nA is set 10 MHz Square. B set 9.999 999 999 94. MHz square. Or set 10 MHz square. With 180 degree 9.999 999 999 940 MHz square.\n\nSimply explained. 9 MHz square with 180 degree 10 MHz square. Will generate 0 volt fore the duration of the shorter square. When both waves are present. When the shorter pulse ends. A volt lasts fore the duration of the remaining of the longer. Making a 100 MHz pulse volt in the exsample. Add 9s 10 times frequency achieved. All this depends on the short length accuracy.\n\nThe idea here is to shake atoms. Generating their sizes in wavelength.\n\nA BACKWARDS GLIDE ON THE SCOPE OF SQUARE A WILL PRESUMABLY MAKE ALL FREQUENCIES POSSIBLE DOWN TO BASE FREQUENCY PR SWEEP. WHEN THE LEFTWARDS GLIDING SQUARE. HITS THE STABLE. A EXTREME FREQUENCY AT HIGHEST POSSIBLE ELECTROMAGNETIC IS MADE. THAT MEANS ALL ATOMS ARE AFFECTED BY RESONANCE. MEANING POSSIBLE ALL ATOMS FROM SMALL TO LARGER ARE SHAKEN.\n\nTHERE FORE THE CO2 SPLITTER MUST BE SENT OVER OCEANS UPWARDS IN THE ATMOSPHERE. TO BE ALLOWED TO HIT ALL CHEMICALS TO SPLIT. NOT OUTWARDS TO BIOLOGY OR GROUND.\n\nAn apparent reduction in water moisture is present at use exo hz synced squares. Appliying hydrogen radius atom resonance. Giving the possibilty of repressurization of the atmosphere. By splitting H and O from H2O. Fore hydrogen production and air mass replenishment. Due to recent lost atmosphere pressure.\n\nCan you tune the high frequency trick?\n\nFore 72 GHz. Magnetic field width vibration. A 10 Mhz square with B 9.9972 Mhz square. This fore geomagnetic shielding or space craft shielding. A repulsive magnetic field. In this the accuracy of shorting red plus red. Needs to be 0.5 mm.\n\nIf you were to test much more demanding stuff into Terra Hz to Exo Hz. The glide of the shorter square. Would sweep maximum physical potential down to base frequency over and over again. However if you had a stable setup. If you wanted to hit B 9.999 999 999 94. Fore 4 Exo Hz. Oxygen resonance.\n\nCould you with measurement. Tune the systems inaccuracies of short? Compensating fore inaccuracies?\n\nDeimmerse from Russian/Chinese terra hz signals at. Mayby 1 or 10 terra hz?\n\nNOTE FORE NUCLEAR EFFECTS. FIFTH HARMONIC OF RADIUS OR DIAMETER OF ATOM.  FREQUENCIES AT 9. 999 999 999 900/980 MHZ B. FOR EFFECT OF UNLEASHING ELECTRONS FROM ATOM SHELL. POTENTIAL REDUCTION OF RADIATION. ANTI GRAVITATING THE ATOM. SET PR COMPOUND PICO mm. Test fore radiation reduction. Both radius diameter and both fifts 4.5 ca times higer frequency. \n\nThe application of 10 mhz square shorted red with 20 mhz square red. To antenna or rf amp inlet. Looks to enhance combustion effects and reduce co2 levels at distance. Due to gliding squares. When the two squares meet on the occilioscope. A extreme frequency is made before sweep down to base frequency and up again to highest electromagnetic potential. Meaning a short duration in atomic renonant frequencies. Long enough to split molecules. Base frequency pair should be chosen to not penetrate to ozone layer.  I belive a borrowed transmitter of 1 k plus watt. Should be gotten. Some calculation be done on ozone layer interference. Then the signal sent. \n\nBecause of the evident ability to diminish water moisture or reduce co2 levels. Aplifying or increase oxygen levels. One may wonder if it is possible. To generally split molecules. Potentially of solid matter. Therfore make possible seperation of molecules into basic elements. Therfore increase by extremes.

Plants' ability to store carbon long-term is practically non-existent unless they get compressed into the earth/beneath the ocean and turned into coal/oil over litteral millenia. We don't have that kind of time.\n\nWith plants you need more and more area to store more and more carbon from the cycle, and their efficency at that task is crap both energy-wise, area-wise, and time-wise.\n\nWe'd need to set aside a massive amount of area to the task, and dedicate massive amounts of manpower to accomplish it, and even then it will take years - if not decades - to truly get going.\n\nCompared with that, a carbon capture plant is more efficent, more effective, cheaper, easier, and takes up less space.\n\nIn other words, yeah. Bill Gates does indeed know more than god at capturing carbon from the atmosphere. As do I for that matter. Nature never evolved with the efficency of carbon capture and storage in mind.

We could potentially get to a place where the carbon emissions we produce are equalised by carbon capture and other technologies. Along side this, we can still have robust environmental regulations to avoid destroying vulnerable habitats and ecosystems. Will we ever have zero impact on the environment? I doubt that - look at the processes to mine minerals which go into creating wind turbines and solar panels. Surely a small impact compared to fossil fuels, but an impact all the same. The same goes for our incredible production of waste year on year - that's not a problem which is easily resolved. \n\nPersonally, I have reasons to be optimistic. Governments (including states within countries, and local governments) and even corporations around the world are jumping on the green bandwagon and committing to net zero carbon targets, so I believe that we can use carbon capture as one piece in the puzzle of a cleaner, greener future for all of us. \n\nCorporations are not blind to the PR nightmare of environmental catastrophe and degradation, and today more than ever are conscious of what lax environmental standards do to their brand - why else would they engage in more expensive, greener approaches to their business models if all they were thinking about was profit? Take companies who buy carbon credits for example - there is no business reason to buy them, and no business reason to be environmentally friendly. Now granted, part of that is to avoid government sanctions, which must surely be a big part of their motivations.\n\nI would have a look at some of the data on per capita CO2 production, which in the Western world is leveling off or declining, and in China has leveled off over the past decade, for example, all while per capita economic growth has boomed. What this shows is that economic growth (on a per capita basis) has been decoupled from CO2 emissions, i.e. it seems like we don't need to increase our CO2 emissions and accept all the environmental drawbacks that come along with that to generate economic growth.\n\nNow if this is the case, and governments are aware of it, then why aren't they starting to turn the corner and loosen up environmental standards and emissions targets? Are you predicting that once the problem of carbon neutrality is solved, then they will start polluting more? If we reach a stage where economies are profitable under a net-zero scenario, then why would they care to start polluting again, especially if there is no political will to do so? If the concern is encroachment on natural habitats, perhaps consider the fact that over the past number of decades, marine and terrestrial protected areas have been increasing in size, not decreasing. Given what I mentioned above (and with what you know), do you see any reason for this to reverse?", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Callum Hair", "channel": "UCHTnzS7zwpAhiugOy6j0NCQ", "votes": "6", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTG1QTqf5yI5RfkDNjkM4AOWhDgYrWVlKnPPg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxeK9AeiqJkQCSun7J4AaABAg", "text": "You all do know that not a single climate change theory, hypothesis, and prediction has been right? Not a SINGLE one. You people think we're God and can control the entire Earth and Nature. I'm an engineer who works on renewable energy and even I think most of those green heads are stupid. \"Nuclear bad, but solar good.\" When nuclear is more efficient and cleaner than solar, and solar only gives less than 10% return efficiency. Then you have John Kerry who takes private jets everywhere and Al Gore whose mansion puts out more CO2 in 1 month than the average American household does in a year.\n\nIn a Duke University study, from the past 35 years, 95% of CO2 has come from the ocean. 4-5% is from nature (animals, volcanoes, etc.) And less than 1% is human (with 90% of that coming from cows/farms).\n\nIn a Green Peace and University study, carbon readings show that the Earth is actually in a CO2 deficit ranking lowest in the past millions of years.\n\nAlso, it seems that the only solution to climate chage is more government control. I've seen private business say they'll implement cleaner initiatives, only for the local or federal governments to say \"no, we don't trust you. We have to do it for you.\"\n\nToo many of you all are being brainwashed! Have some common sense and think for yourself. Yes, cleaner more efficient energy is better. Yes we shouldn't pollute. But it is absurd to believe all these lying politicians and \"scientists\" (quotes because they've been caught cheating experiments, being bought off, and showing little to no scientific integrity) on everything. If it was up to them and their beliefs, we'd either be under water (Al Gore's prediction for 2010) or we would lose our entire facility system as they try to have us run everything off of solar panels and wind... imagine Alaska or Sweden when the nights are days long, etc. (And before you say they can \"store the energy\", no you can't. Storing energy is and has always been an issue. And if you know anything about engineering and science, you wouldn't be arguing that)\n\nThanks for listening to my TED TALK. (P.S.

It temporarily changes the location of co2 from air to its mass, but when it inevitably dies, it will return this co2 back to the atmosphere via rotting, burning, etc...\n\nThe main issue with co2 is that we extracted \"it\" from the depths of the earth where it would have rested indefinitely and pumped it into our atmosphere via burning. Amount burnt or transferred from depths to the atmosphere has little effect on that 1,5 C. Our main \"enemy\" in that regard is the sun which heats our planet at a rate of 1kW per meter square and subsequently the fact that the heat has no way of venting out because of the glasshouse effect.\n\nThe real solution lies in developing fuel that by burning leaves more net atmosphere cooling parts than heating parts. That way, the effect can be delivered by the same vehicles that caused our problems - distributing our effort globally rather than localizing our co2 fighting efforts in the few locations where these plants have been built - which ultimately don't even turn out to be carbon negative, but carbon neutral.

Bamboo does not grow fast enough to retrieve the co2 that releases from a dead bamboo. There's a reason why most experts aren't looking at bamboo as a solution.

The goal should be to generate the lowest carbon energy, while improving the lives of all humans worldwide. Obviously oil and gas companies are involved with the sequestration aspect of this tech because they’re the ones with the subsurface knowledge to properly store CO2. It’s not as easy as just pumping it in the ground forever. Furthermore, no one discusses the emissions and environmental issues associated with green energy materials, but that’s a story for another day... Lastly, to the Stanford professor’s point, CO2 doesn’t store at a 1 to 1 ratio to hydrocarbon produced. Rather, due to a process called adsorption, reservoirs are able to store more CO2. In fact in some coal seams, the ratio can be as high as 10:1 (CO2 stored to methane produced). All in all this is a good video and it’s important to draw attention to this up and coming tech, however, I can definitely sense a tone of bias towards oil companies producing lower emission hydrocarbons which could be used to improve the lives of people without adequate access to energy and displace higher emission energy (coal) in places like China.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Jeremy Wolf", "channel": "UCOayX67UaUaMh1xUyU3bdaw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQpF_bIQmhR-GQIJsaLpgJVFPfisAxPQMWrLw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Or maybe more to the point solving the cost prohibitive part of direct carbon capture would also lower the cost of competing solutions. The primary cost driver is  cheap renewable energy. And we are already fairly close to the maximum expected efficiencies of pulling carbon out of the air. This is very different than the situation with solar panels 20 years ago. They were cost constrained by efficiencies well below the theoretical maximums and manufacturing costs. And of course if you solve the cheap renewable energy problem then why not just replace the fossil fuel emitting plants. \n\nCarbon capture may be important for handling a few specific high value carbon sources. For example it can be used to make green aircraft fuel. But this is sort of the last hardest problem. There are many many problems that can be solved much cheaper for much higher impact. And it may be worth some level of investment now so we will be ready for this.\n\nThe big worry though is that these projects will be used as excuses to continue emitting. People who just want to profit off of fossil fuels will point to carbon capture as a reason its ok. People not very interested will take their word for it, not realizing that it will almost certainly be more expensive than investment in better batteries and electric grids.

If they did our planet would be like Venus. But CO2 and the other greenhouse gases are enough to keep our planet at a moderate temperature. Consider that the Earth and Moon are both the same distance from the sun. The only reason the Earth has a warmer climate is the very small amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It's the very fact that Earth's CO2 is only 0.04% that makes this such a big deal. If CO2 were abundant our emissions wouldn't be significant enough to impact it.

If life absorbed it at the rate we emit it, the concentration in the atmosphere would be static. The very fact that CO2 is 50% more than it was before the industrial revolution is proof that trees, other living things, and other carbon sinks are not absorbing it fast enough.  The Ordovician ice-age wasn't the only such event, but it goes to show a common fallacy that climate skeptics make with arguments. That's the \"single-cause\" fallacy. Greenhouse gases are is one of three basic things that regulate the planet's temperature. The other two are the sun and aerosols. You can have levels of CO2 and still get an ice age if the planet is getting less solar radiation or has more aerosols in the atmosphere. Similarly, I can regulate the temperature in my house by turning the heat up or opening a window. I can turn the heat all the way up, but if the windows are open it won't warm up. You have to consider multiple factors. We know CO2 is one factor. Currently, the Earth is warming even as solar irradiance is decreasing. That's a tell-tail sign that humans are causing the problem.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Adam Bram", "channel": "UCP9X1QVvqfvwSzm6GCf6Xdw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSHr4YRjL1NgRQA99qiHkZHTjg6cm6306A6pWxIng=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You are correct in mentioning albedo. Albedo and aerosols fall in the \"Reflectivity\" category. The point is that these three categories (or things) work together to maintain temperature. Within each category are multiple things. For example, greenhouse gases include CO2, but they also include water vapor, methane, ozone, etc. Solar irradiance takes into account the energy from the sun, the Earth's orbit, the tilt of the Earth at a given time, etc. Breaking into three broad categories makes it easier to digest. You mentioned the oceans. That would be part of the greenhouse gas category because oceans can be a carbon sink or carbon source depending on other factors. But the ultimate thing that matters is how much greenhouse gas is in the atmosphere. You said, \"The earth has trended sideways for the last 20 years. The last 5 slightly down per NOAAs web site data.\" What is it you are referring to? The temperature, CO2 concentration, or something else?

So if we currently are living during the warm period, AND we have a historically very low reading of CO2 in the atmosphere, would it not be reasonable to conclude that OTHER things dictate the climate, such as solar cycles and Earth's orbit oscillations? And if there were periods of earths history with 5000 units vs current 400 units of CO2 in the atmosphere AND Earth is not currently Venus, then isnt it blatantly obvious that we have a LOOOOOOONG way to go by adding one twenty-fifth of total CO2 emissions in the atmosphere? During the 1990s they promised all major port cities in the world to be under water if we didnt stop producing CO2 as we did back then, however, since then people are making almost twice the amount of CO2 and none of the coastal cities are as much as half-flooded.
