Therefore no observable change. That is why the CSIRO could not present any empirical data for climate change when requested to do so by Senator Graham. The only thing observed to date is natural variability. \nAlso looking at your other statements your conflating issues.

There are a small handful of satellites in space that monitor solar particles, and their data is yet to enter mainstream climate science. There are 30+ factors of solar and cosmic influence on earth's climate, and only 1 (direct visible sunlight) is included in mainstream climate models. The strongest greenhouse gas on earth by far is water vapor. Meanwhile, water vapor condensed into clouds is a cooling factor. Water vapor requires a particle to condense into clouds, and this particle is often a cosmic ray. The amount of cosmic rays entering the atmosphere is influenced by the strength of solar wind, which greatly fluctuates. The sun also electro-magnetically heats the earth through atmospheric electric circuits, the same system that helps energize thunder storms. The sun outputs many high energy particles other than direct sunlight. In some cases, so many high energy particles are emitted that they dim visible sunlight by 1%. Despite these high energy particles having a strong heating effect on the earth the climate models count these events as a reduction in solar power, as direct sunlight has dimmed. Those are just 3 major factors that are conveniently ignored by mainstream climate science. This isn't about a grand conspiracy, it's about career scientists towing the line and protecting their cushy jobs and funding.

No humility, no critical thinking, no intelligent unemotional answers with facts that show any consensus with the entire scientific community. No scientist is that sure about such a complicated system that even can muster a valid and or even close to a close simulation that turns out correct even 10% of the time because the ocean convections are almost impossible to predict, much less understand by these ego centric personalities that obviously do not like to even be questioned without throwing back some stereotypical insult and generalizing an entire political party, which has nothing to do with the debate. This man is an insult to the scientific community and I'm not even concerned about what the correct answer is our even guess from someone with the inability to think like a skeptic or let anyone else do it for him. This man doesn't practice the much needed humility to admit errors, and learn from them to move closer to anything brought on by wisdom he will never come close to achieving in anything with that educated ego that puts feelings above honest observations or admitting incomplete data facts that cannot be achieved in important areas. Forget his education creditability, his failure to value rational thinking or even feel it is necessary, shows he's not what science needs on a complicated study such as climate change. This guy pushed an agenda to further his name or bank account, who knows. He is far from the man he invisions himself to be to push his sponsers agenda as the priority. True climate and physics scholars laugh at this character and probably never take him seriously, like he does those who are skeptical of his work or statements.

For thousands of years there have been trends of climate change in both directions. The amount of measurable climate change in recent years is way too small to definitively say the trend is heading toward disaster. That is Lindzen's opinion. Other experts on atmospheric CO2 claim the increase from 180ppm to 380ppm in the past 150 years is good for the atmosphere by increasing green plant life and O2.

{"cid": "UgxG6af0WWvED8GxItJ4AaABAg", "text": "I didnt see him schooling anyone, what i seen was someone coming up with excuses, if it is that clear cut and dry then all the rest of the climate scientist would be on board. almost half of climate scientist  /a meteorologist do not agree in manmade climate change. Is the climate always changing yes anyone that denies that is an idiot. Before someone says that is inaccurate u better do some research. I forgot how many thousands of the worlds climate and meteorologist scientist were polled in 2019 if they believed man had an affect on climate change, barely over 50% believed that. Then we get into other scientist around the were geologist and many other fields and that number is even less in favor  of man made climate change, and one of the main points of contention with them is they all say they do not include solar activity in there models  That 97% of the worlds scientist believe in manmade climate change has been proven false many times now yet many keep spouting that nonsense.  I believe there is a lot we still do not know, I also believe we should start striving for cleaner energy, I dont have a problem with that, but the ruining of millions of lives by making the change so drastically without that gradual change is not the way to do it. I believe people need to clean up after themselves and stop polluting the ocean and the land, and stop killing and abusing everything in this world . But the bottom line is if u still have not convinced the rest of the scientist or atleast the majority of them then u shouldnt expect there to be enough to convince normal people. I can even post u several videos one of which, a main stream news channel digs into the story, shows where the 97% myth started, and went around interviewing  climate and meteorologist scientist that did not believe in man made climate change. She was asking them why they didnt believe that and talked about  research done i think at cambridge university and a prestigious american university, where they polled thousands of climate and meteorologist if they believed man was affecting climate change, and just over half believed man was affecting it. Many of them said the same thing i said that solar activity is not taken into account in climate models. That they know for a fact solar activity has been high for last couple decades. So how can concencensus be reached if leaving out important information. There is also the fact that Nasa changed the data and has admitted as much on global temperatures, there reason was that they believed there were inaccuracies so they were trying to account for that. There is another group of scientist of several thousand that formed a group to prove man isnt affecting the climate, and they say the data was accurate, but the data didnt help man made climate change agenda because, the pre changed data shows without a shadow of a doubt that there is no man made climate change. No correlation between co2 and rise in temperature. That group consist of climate scientist, meteorologist, geologist, ecologist, astronomist, oceanography, and atmospheric  scientist. Quite a big group that looks at more than one point of data that looks at it all and comparing it. So its not just as simple as one group denies it with no evidence, the burden of proof falls on the one claiming it, and the vast majority have said that has not been done. You have a lot of scientist in those fields u need to convince before u can convince an entire population of the earth.", "time": "7 months ago (edited)", "author": "Rollack", "channel": "UCSMr9Q6Jek2D0-xXUSUXT-w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8ENcjStVF5Q_PCjKQDBrspj36as_ABTiEzg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If the earths temperature change by 2 degrees over 10000 years, we can deal with that and adapt. If it changes more than 3 degrees over 200 years we're in a lot of trouble. We've set up our infrastructure for a world that is a degree colder, and temperatures are still rapidly rising. This is what's the danger, that houses we built  a few decades ago will get flooded, fields and wells we've been relying on will dry up before we can move to new water sources or set up new transport lines for food, that storms and wildfires destroy towns because we didn't know these areas would be at risk when they were settled, or that cities in the subtropics will simply become to hot to live there, never mind the fact that it's harder to supply them with food and water.\nWe can deal with all these changes, even very rapidly respond to them. For example the Netherlands have built an incredible dam system, but that is incredibly expensive. Climate change won't end human civilization, but it will force us to change a lot of the stuff to protect ourselves from these new problems. Divorcing fossile fuels and preventing emissions is simply the better deal. It's cheaper to build renewables now rather than fixing the damages later.\nSo with all of that, even if in 10000 years that climate has changed and the renewable plants we have now aren't as effective, because there'll never be a point where they aren't effective at all, the sun always shines, the wind always blows, if they aren't as effective well adapt because we have time to do so. Right now we don't have that time, or at least not without paying for it in trillions.\nAnd just because this illustrates the point nicely. You expressed the worry of being dependent on these natural cycles, were already dependent on them. Coal and oil don't last forever. They were created by these cycles and everything that were digging up right now was once in the atmosphere. Now were putting it back an dealing with the subsequent consequences.

If that sort of thing happens we just have to suck it up. But I don't see why renewables would be less useful than other forms of energy acquisition in that scenario. \nEither way, the main difference between those kinds of events and the scenario we are in right now is that we can prevent our climate from shifting. We have the control of and pretty much the sole responsibility for climate change. So we should definitely do something about it.\n\nDoes it makes sense though to use the term \"wiped out\" though when speaking about time spans of 1-2K years? Because I would argue we don't really care about that sort of stuff. That is the gradual change I talked about. In those case we can adapt and I imagine that's what the people who livied there did. After all, the probably didn't get on big drought and then all either die or flee elsewhere. They probably noticed over the course of generations that their fields yielded less and less, until some son decided not to follow the example of his parents and grandparents and simply decided to live and try his luck elsewhere. We can deal with that sort of thing. What we can't deal with is when these fields dry up in a single generation. \nOf course wind- and hydropower are ultimately also solar energy, but as you said, while they might change a bit, there'll always be a lot of direct solar energy to go around, which also means that there will still be wind and rivers. Maybe a wind power plant won't produce as much but that the wind will completely stop in that area is pretty unlikely. Renewable energy sources aren't as reliable as others means of generating power, because they can't be controlled as flexibly, but despite fluctuations you can still rely on them producing a lot of power.\nWhen it comes to nuclear energy, I'm also very disappointed in the environmentalist movement for disavowing nuclear power. I live in Germany and about two decades past my country decided to phase out nuclear power. I think that was disastrous decision. To me it's clear that the fossil plants should have been turned of first. That being said, I'm not knowledgeable enough on the topic to say weather it's worth investing into new nuclear plants now. After all that sector is extremely expensive. I'm not clear on the question weather to prevent climate change it's better to simply invest into renewables now or if it makes sense to muster the huge funds necessary for investments in nuclear.\n\nWhen it comes to changing the climate back to previous levels, I don't know of anyone who has that as their stated goal. I think the overwhelming majority in the climate movement would be ecstatic if the climate stayed exactly as it is now. It's mainly about stopping the trend to more warming rather than getting to a particular level. And right now it doesn't look like the warming trend will stop enough to prevent a pretty drastic shift in temperature. So I think the climate movement is absolutely necessary to get governments to act on climate protection, otherwise in a few decades we probably will end up with trillions in damages world wide because of the temperature shift .", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Xsomono", "channel": "UCERGlMls8CCaXsG45vWY3FA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEZcgR1gp0AqvcuHF2ZstSgOHY90PsxhQx5e8klQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The senator, albeit ineloquently attempts to allude to historical trends of warming that have been occurring since the Little Ice Age of the 1700s as well as previous trends throughout the millennia, since well before we consumed carbon at the level we do. Furthermore, there are other legitimate objections to the \"negativity\" that anthropogenic climate change poses to the biosphere, one being that vegetation has never been more fruitful in aggregate around the globe, despite deforestation (which is not desirable, I'll point out). Another objection being, is that the activity of the star we orbit has a much bigger impact on the warming trends than the state of gaseous carbon in our atmosphere as we are supposedly due for the most impactful solar minimum in centuries as well as other potential game changing climate events. Our carbon \"taxes\" and Paris Climate Accords are posturing and nothing else.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "LegendKiller0084", "channel": "UCkr2ZeKyEtWTfQxOtFqyNsA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTuQrlHRdzhhhXNwXzIRfvl3pXxXEFCuEAcqQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

To argue that would be akin of being diagnosed with cancer by 97 doctors, only to find 3 who would disagree, 2 of which are probably funded by Dupont or Phillip Morris, and the other just not good at his job.\n\nThird, the US contributes 1 of every 25 deaths in this country to air pollution.

Science is a debate, not a consensus as many believe today. \"Well. 97% all believe\".....We are scaring the world into believing that life will end in 10 years if we do nothing, which is shameful.

The primary difference between past cycles and the current one, though, is the rate of change of co2 concentrations and associated temperature. The simple kind of \"series of events\" and questions that have led to our current understanding of climate is something like this: \n\nClimate is warming. Why? Well there are natural cycles in solar insolation, earth wobble, orbital eccentricities etc. Well, we tested those ideas and found that changes in astral sources of warming don't explain all of the variability in temperature. So there's likely a source here on Earth. Researchers then turned to ice cores, tree rings, fossils, formanifera, and other long term natural record keepers and found that atmospheric co2 seemed to track climate extensively. They found co2 levels and temperature have fluctuated wildly before human beings even had axes.\n\nOkay, so co2 is associated with temperature. Are we just in a natural cycles of co2 fluctuation then? This is where we are currently at; the answer is maybe but probably no. Recent rates of co2 concentration increase and associated warming are much higher than observed over previous natural cycles. This is where many of the current complex \"ensemble\" models come from. Now we are using models of movement of energy and radiative forcing to try to understand the sources and consequences of co2 and other greenhouse gas emmissions, and all models point to an anthropogenic source that far outpaces natural variation. \n\nThis is not to say that natural cycles still aren't occurring. We are simply exacerbating a natural change. \n\nThere's very few conservatives that deny climate change entirely. They are just asking the scientific and economic question of: What % of blame are human beings at fault given the data on thousands of years of average global temperature and what can we do about it within the bounds of money?\n\nhttps://shepherdgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/youngerdryas-holocene.jpg", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "readyshredyspaghetti", "channel": "UCrJOwcs8XZkGah79_t3z0rQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSYrXOsXhIZ4dFYN16GaISTHeyVu3IMnsyM8vOy=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Climate change has been investigated for over a century now. Not by 1 group of scientists, but by thousands of scientists of different universities and the majority of countries around the world. \nAre the above scrutiny? Absolutely not. They are under constant scrutiny by other scientists.\nIf 3% of scientists would claim that the Earth is flat, would you claim that 97% is wrong and that 97% is in on some conspiracy? \nIt is clear that you don't know the scientific process. \nI have done scientific research for years at a university in Belgium. The biggest goal was for me to prove my results to be wrong. It is what scientists do. Trying to prove your own hypothesis wrong.

The Earth must re-radiate the energy it receives from the sun. We can measure the energy Earth receives from the sun and then use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate Earth's effective emission temperature.\n\nDoing so we obtain a value of 255 K = -18 C = 0 F. This theoretical value was confirmed by satellite observations in the 1960s.\n\nBut if you look out your window you will see Earth is not frozen. In fact Earth's GMST is ~288 K = 15 C = 59 F. The difference of 33 C was noted in 1827.\n\nYou can also work out something weird is going on by looking at the Moon. Why is the lunar surface so much colder (on average) than Earth's?\n\nIt took about two seconds for people to suggest that the fact Earth has an atmosphere and the moon doesn't might play a role. The question was: how?\n\nWe have already seen a big clue. If you were high above Earth and pointed an IR telescope at Earth the reading you obtained would NOT be surface temperature. The upper atmosphere masks the surface. The same is true for Venus - the IR readings from Earth are very different from Venus's actual surface temperature.\n\nThe opacity of the atmosphere to IR is reflected in the atmosphere's optical thickness. You can only see one optical thickness into the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the temperature at that altitude is fixed at 255 K.\n\nNow we can answer the initial question. If you add CO2 to the atmosphere you make it optically thicker. So the emission altitude moves higher - closer to the top of the atmosphere. But in the troposphere temperature increases as altitude decreases. So moving the emission altitude higher increases surface temperature.\n\nAny questions?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "PhD Tony", "channel": "UCzhfDMZzZktbrvQQ_7VN81w", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRE_si971sDqyJouA69LpdJWjyys33xRBNPg8PUgQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The fact Earth is not trapped in a snowball state is due entirely to CO2.\n\nDuring a snowball event albedo is much higher so nearly all solar energy is reflected to space. Also, there is very little water vapour available. So such phases are very cold and tend to stay cold.\n\nThe only mechanism that can break Earth out of a snowball event is volcanic outgassing of CO2 - which is VERY slow.\n\nAlso, we know there was liquid water on Earth's surface 4 billion years ago when the sun was 30% dimmer. This is called the \"Faint young sun paradox\" and the solution again is the greenhouse effect.\n\nYou can find detailed discussions of these observations and many others in any textbook on planetary climate.\n\nI will also draw your attention to the fact that one of the major tests of CO2 radiative forcing was observations of Venus.

I think maybe one way forward is to bring the discussion to the fundamental subject of truth and facts. We know that nature does not care about opinions. The laws of physics does not change based on someone's opinion. Anyone who will subscribe to this fact could also realize that two opposing beliefs about what happens in nature cannot both be true. After agreeing on that, we can start talking about methods of gaining knowledge about what's really happening in nature. We can agree that we need a method with as much objectivity as possible (removing as much human bias as possible). With that established in our conversation, we can learn that science applies such a method. We can talk about the scientific method and why it's important, it's strengths and limitations.\n\nJust my five cents on the subject.

The end is the end and what will bring it around should be irrelevant. \n\nAs far as telling you exactly what will happen, I can't. I'm not a fortune teller and even if I was, I wouldnt be very effective because fortune tellers are charlatans. There are ideas about what will happen. Increased casualties due to extreme weather. Mass migration as a result of these extreme temperatures, precipitation, hurricanes, rising sea levels. \n\nAs far as finger pointing goes. Nobody is pointing the finger at just the US. But the US has been incredibely uneager to do their part. China, however, is the biggest investor in renewable energy. The average Chinese person produces about 1/3rd of the carbon emissions the average American does.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "svennie pennie", "channel": "UCset_Kkn_K4kO-Zs5bS-r1w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTKuNjxZgOUAXQYD7wvKWQl8EayCn1JXo5suA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(it is good, that the greenhouse gases exist, without them our global surface temperature would be -18°C on average according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law)\nsince humans caused an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere, and since CO2 is a greenhouse gas, humans are responsible for the increasing temperatures since 1850. thats the short and simplified version.\n\nnow to my question \"can you evaluate what mistake johnson did there when he said \"so those variations just end right now, so its all man made?\"\nhe ignores the time needed for those variations to occur. (a one word answer with \"time\" or \"time scale\" or \"time needed\" would have been enough for me)\nthe orbital elements of the earth cycle in ten thousands of years. those variations dont stop, but if you only observe them for a few decades, they will appear to be constant and will not have any impact on the climate.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "tom thecasual", "channel": "UC1yhtLraXctZpL1pDpn0uKQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS7OD3uJP5NXP-Wz9TEqHqrcgy4ll5m0N94FA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I believe that he made this prediction in 2004, which would indicate that the seas should have risen 1.4 meters by now.  According to National Geographic website, they have risen 10-20 centimeters. \n\nDr. Hansen proposes carbon taxes while admitting this would only mitigate the problem. Of course, such proposals don't consider the negative impact to US and world economies resulting in lower research funding and perhaps less opportunity for a technological solution that could actually solve the problem.\n\nDr. Hansen has written extensively in favor of nuclear fuels. His writings were challenged by reputable scientists as using data that was \"incomplete and misleading\" and \"lacking credibility\".\n\nDr. Hansen's assertion that \"the man-made effect is now dominate\" is disputed by many reputable climatologists.\n\nPolitical activists like Hansen create chaos with exaggerated claims. They throw gasoline on a dispute that is already burning out of control. We need reason, not inflammatory rhetoric.

{"cid": "UgwKFlw81g4GHrQgrM94AaABAg", "text": "I didn't see any \"schooling\" evident in Hansen's testimony. What I saw was an ignorant, bullying political activist attempting to question the Senator rather than answer the questions.\n\nFor example, at 0:38 Hansen tries to assert the PDO explains a 16 year \"pause\" in global warming (it is now up to 20 years). Umm, no. PDOs do not last for decades.Try again. Oh, and Hansen did try many times over the past 20 years to come up with some ad hoc explanation. He failed with every attempt.\n\nAgain, at 2:00 Hansen tries to assert the warming experienced 10,000 years ago, which took us out of the last Ice Age, was due to orbital mechanics. Umm, no. Orbital mechanics investigated by Milutin Milankovic more than 100 years ago is insufficient to explain why levels of CO2 at 5000ppmv did not keep us warm. Three of the last 10 deglaciation periods occurred while earth's eccentricity was decreasing from its maximum, and two of the last 10 deglaciation periods occurred while earth's eccentricity was a minimum. So fully 50% of the last 10 deglaciations do not fit the theory. In science we call this a \"lack of correlation\". Look it up. Pure chance has an equally good result as to why glaciations and deglaciations have occurred over the past 10 climate cycles. This is why mainstream science ignored Milankovic's theory until about 1976, which immediately preceded Hansen's campaign to convince the world we must stop using fossil fuels. In other words, the sudden increase in interest in Milankovic's dead theory had nothing to do with science, and everything to do with concocting a case against humanity to blame us for causing global warming. \n\nDoubt this? Svante Arrhenius was also discredited by his peers, leaving his theory about a trace gas in earth's atmosphere languishing until the 1980s. Then pseudoscientists (like Hansen) who were studying climate ignored 60 years of established climate science to begin popularizing Arrhenius's idea (it wasn't a theory, because it wasn't developed sufficiently to qualify). The liars were counting on years of cleaning out libraries to bury the evidence against Milankovic and Arrhenius so that their false climate models would withstand criticism by all but the most persistent research scientists, and these could be easily dismissed and discredited as a \"fringe element\" by those in control of the scientific journals and major organizations.\n\nThe problem? The pseudoscientists went too far in their predictions, and more real scientists started to take notice. Now that every global climate model based on warming due to the increase in CO2 has been fully discredited, and the idea of warming due to a tiny increase in a trace gas in earth's atmosphere has been debunked, the pseudoscientists like Hansen are running around like Chicken Little screaming, \"The planet is warming, the planet is warming!\" They aren't doing any more science, they are attempting to silence their critics.\n\nThis is not science. Scientists never attempt to silence critics. Fascists do that, and fascism is a Leftist tool to gain and consolidate power.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "johndaddyo444", "channel": "UCiIb_kan2VaxoMe8Ec-dBrg", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQgdvstKmwcj6XMESyGUJlI8hgJ--vY1P-PG6ZL=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

A prefix of \"Drastic\" or \"Disastrous\" would make the point better.\nBut although \"Anthropogenic Global Warming\" can be exposed to the trivial objection \"Well it's not happening here\", it is more totally accurate, and James Hansen in one particular sentence made it clear.\nHuman conversion of fossil carbon sequestered by the Carboniferous period, consuming oxygen from the same origin, to make the persistent infrared-absorbing CO2, is changing the rate at which the planet can radiate as much energy outwards as is coming in. \nIt is therefore retaining daily enough of the prodigious solar radiation to which the oceans especially are exposed, that overall it is retaining more heat. That is Global Warming.\nWeather prediction is fiendishly difficult, climate predictions almost as bad (or maybe worse). But the global sum of radiation in and out is comparatively easy.\nPeople whose idea of climate is merely historical are hampered even to understand that the planet's atmosphere for 3500 million years was nothing at all like ours. Physicists, chemists, and  biologists generally believe that the oxygen in the atmosphere is a product of photosynthesis and tectonic burial of drowned vegetation, as are the fossil carbon and hydrocarbon fuels. That immense change took somewhat more than 60 million years.\nBefore that, there was a time when the chief \"greenhouse\" gas was methane at a concentration  of tens of ppm, not the hundreds of ppm of today's CO2.

{"cid": "UghfeUn9fElSLngCoAEC.8NKNQgeeHvM8OIeAKuKhni", "text": "Tim Nemec  the only thing I need to know is that the same stuff has been said over and over and over again and again for the past 50 years, the world climate is changing, and we must do something about it, as humans. Let me ask you this, how many of you believers in this new false religion, would give up your lattes, watches, phones, iPads or tablets, computers, homes, cars, or even reading glasses. You blame fossil fuels for the leading cause to climate change, but everything I mentioned was made with the process of fossil fuels, that makes you hypocrites. You want to change the human race and the progress we have made over the last 2000 years, then let's put everything back to as it was 2000 years ago, so say good by to all the medical advancements do to fossil fuels, good by to all the safety features on our cars due to fossil fuels, so good by to that child seat due to fossil fuels, say good by to the light bulb due to the fossil fuels, and most of all, so good by to the lights, because we would not have had the advancement in electricity if it was not due to fossil fuels. So you want to blame individuals, and tell individuals we all must change, no, you change on your own believes, because the only proof is statistics, and every model is just a theoretical model, such as the  Big Bang theory, just that a theory, but all of you just want to pass theory as truth just because you believe it is. And then when christians calls on his God, you claim false hood, and proof. I hear and see the numbers, but no actual concrete physical proof, is that not what you ask christians, proof. I have proof of my God Yahweh, it is the Bible, plus thousands and thousands of concrete evidence, which date back to 5000 b.c. My evidence is my God, Yahweh, my credentials are my God Yahweh, you want to have truth go speak to Him. You people are right, the climate is changing, and yes it is due to Man, but for not the reasons you say, it is due to mans sins, and as we move forward, the weather will get worse, there will be famines, there will be bigger storms, all the ice caps will melt, and earthquakes will continue to get worse and yes one of mans worse fate will be nuclear war. Because man will continue to see himself as his own maker, his own creator. You will turn lies into truths, evil in to good and shrug at the one true living creator of the entire world, solar system and galactic galaxies beyond our own. And if you keep denying Him and continue down your path of self righteousness and self proclaiming yourselves as gods, this world will continue to get darker and darker, and there will be nothing in this world you can do to change it. You then will bow down to a leader who will deceive all, that such this world has ever seen, the liar of all liars and you will call him as your one god, and then it will be to late and when my God Yahweh, His Son Jesus Christ returns, you then will know who the one true God is and you will bow down before Him. These are not my words, these are the words of my God Yahweh, the God of Noah, of Moses, of Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob.

The sudden changes in weather or directly explainable by CO2's ability. To begin with the warm climate we had for milions of years was thanks to increase in CO2 in the atmosphere (but lower then what we have now). The current CO2 content of the air is much higher then what was in there in past milions of years. If i remember correctly the CO2 increased due to seismic activity and eruptions in the pat but even those didn't manage to create such a high CO2 content as we did.\n\nAlso god damnit how many times do i have to say it.\nPLANTS DONT BREATH CO2\nTHEY REQUIRE OXIGEN: What are you doing at schools cmon. Plants just as anything else need oxigen. CO2 is simply required for photosynthesis. And photosynthesis is about manufacture of SUGARS.  Oxigen is just a byproduct. It's the most basic thing taught in schools.\n\nAll of your arguments here were already proven by scientific research in past hundreds of years (photosynthesis, CO2 effects, development of earth, chemical composition of air during the centuries, chemcical properties in climate development). The fact is you lack even the simples understanding of photosynthesis which is taught to 10 years old kids yet you think you are right. \n\nNoone is trying to remove all CO2 from air. Entire plant ecosystem can sustain itself with no other sourse of CO2 other then themselves. SO much for your argument \"We decrease production cuz plants need it\". \nAlso i shall repeat myself. PLANTS DONT BREATH CO2 and PLANTS PERFORM BETTER WITH OXIGEN RICH ATMOSPHERE. \n\nAnother scientific fact, there was entire stage of earths development when our atmosphere was way more rich in oxigen and smallest of plants grew into some really big proportions. That type of atmosphere was unbreatheable for humans by the way. \n\nWhy not start with educating yourself on basic scientific knowledge first.

Historically co2 has helped regulate the temperature of the Earth's crust by retaining the heat of the Sun as it passes through our atmosphere and reflects off the Earth's surface. As co2 levels in our atmosphere increase more of the sun's heat is trapped, warming the planet. This effect helped end the last major ice age. co2 is not dangerous, in fact it's good for the planet as it helps maintain a steady atmospheric temperature. What's bad for the planet and many of the species that call it home is a change in the ppm. This change as explained above will warm (or cool if the ppm were in the reverse and falling) the planet and force thousands of less adaptable species to the brink of extinction. The ppm of co2 in the atmosphere has been recorded for hundreds of thousands of years through the clever use of onstage air pockets from ice samples across the globe. we can see the natural rise and fall of co2 in the atmosphere and compare it's effects with what the planet was going through environmentally and geologically at the time. An example being the end of the last ice age as I mentioned earlier. what isn't natural is the rate of ppm increase over the last hundred years, where we have seen a massive increase in atmospheric co2.

Callendar, who speculated 30 years prior that the rising co2 levels in the earth's atmosphere was the cause of a warming global average temperature. These scientists through studies and experiments of their own (which are very well documented and easily searchable online) helped them prove Callendar's 30 year old prediction. Callendar wasn't the first to speculate that c02 in the earth's atmosphere could effect the climate however. In Victorian England, a small group of scientists gained an unfortunate reputation for suggesting that the carbon from human industry could one day lead to a rising global temperature. The effects of c02 in the atmosphere have been studied and recorded by humans for a long time.\nThat's the history behind the notion that c02 is 'bad' - which I'd like to point out is false. In nature there is no such thing as good or bad, as the idea of something being better than something else is a human concept not a natural law. The same can be said for the planets 'health.' The health of the planet is judged by how healthy the planet is for us (humans and other species) to live on in relative comfort. So for the sake of my reply I'm going to refrain from using these sorts of concepts and stick, as you have to numbers.\nYou mentioned the earth once had an atmosphere of nearly 4000 ppm of c02. I assume to don't have an issue with the way this number was acquired through drilling into Antarctic ice like many who challenge the science behind global warming. Through the use of geological surveying we can observe that during this time of high atmospheric c02 concentration that the earth was experiencing heavy volcanic activity, and had been for some considerable time. This was before the last great ice age. In fact, so much ash was launched into the atmosphere that it blocked a majority of the suns light, giving birth to said ice age.The long and the short of it is, I can verify why adding c02 into the earth's atmosphere has an effect. Linking all of my resources here however would take far too long and I think rather spoil the joy of discussion. Instead I ask that if this is something you find interesting, you fact-check my statements in your own time and come back with your own findings, be they in agreement with what I say or not. The earth does have natural cycles. You and I agree on this, as we agree levels of c02 change throughout earths history.

I'm in a lose lose situation here so do me a favour and just listen read this part carefully please I'll try to summarise it for you. \n\nThe equations describe radioactive decay with respect to time. Scientists observed that the amount of radioactive material decreased overtime.

Any idiot that did even an iota of physics knows that this can be described mathematically in the form of a straight line equation. \n\nNOW READ THIS PART CAREFULLY THIS IS HOW IT IS RELEVANT \n\nBecause C-14 within fossil fuels decays there will be a lower C-14/C-12 ratio in fossil fuels as compared to the C-14/C-12 ratio in the atmosphere (atm). Therefore when these fuels are burnt into CO2 there will be more C-12 pumped into the atmosphere lowering the ratio. This is common sense. It also happens that the fall of this ratio coincides with the start of the industrial revolution. You could say that correlation does not equal causation but then that would mean this is one massive coincidence. \n\nThere are other evidences that elucidate the fact that climate change is spearheaded by CO2 emission from fossil fuels but this one is a good one.\n\nI was wrong about C-13 though. The reason the C-13/C-12 ratio is decreasing is because plants prefer to collect 12-CO2 as opposed to 13-CO2.

I can't believe you actually used the \"muh plants\" argument while ignoring everything else. So what if will increase plant growth? We are still privy to floods and ocean acidification which will make our lives much worse. In addition to that, when CO2 is no longer the limiting factor in photosynthesis something else will be, eventually slowing plant growth anyway and even still there are other ways scientists are trying to increase plant growth for example the enzyme Rubisco is not very efficient at all. It costs the plant at most 50% of it's biomass due to this inefficiency. I'll give you a little bit of credit though. The amount of C-14 in the air does not stay constant, the C-14/C-12 ratio does. It only changes over long periods of time. I have stated this countless times before in previous comments yet you wait until I got lazy and made a mistake to attack that point. Quite disingenuous if you ask me. \n\nAgain CO2 increase has to be by via man made climate change because if it were indeed natural, the C-13/C-12 ratio would not fall due to the carbon cycle. Please give me one reason to believe that the C-13/C-12 ratio would just fall naturally which all the while just happening to coincide with the start of the industrial revolution. It is true that correlation does not equal causation just like if a detective is suspects a random Joe of being a midnight serial killer because he's never home at midnight doesn't mean he is a serial killer it could be a coincidence but it's worth investigating. However, if it is further revealed that he has had a bad history with women and all of the victims were women then that really increases suspicion. It looks more and more likely that he did it but it could still all be a coincidence and now lets say this random joe used a chain saw on all of his victims and we find that he usually works with chain saws and thus has easy access to them. This piece of evidence by itself does not mean he is the killer but combined with all the other pieces of evidence it looks like he is, more than likely, the killer. \n\n\nIt's the same with climate change. C14/C12 ratio has been decreasing since the start of the industrial revolution. Now volcanoes could have caused this but that is ruled out due to the fact that C13/C-12 ratio is also decreasing. This could only be due to fossil fuel combustion as plants prefer C12. This fall has been found to have started during the advent of the industrial revolution. \n\nWhy CO2? Why doo we think CO2 is the culprit? Well it's a greenhouse gas. This is due to the fact that CO2 is polar. Thus is able to absorb IR strongly. It could be solar radiation causing the warming but that does not explain the change in the C13/C12 ratio. Nor does it explain why it's occurring so quickly. The relationship between  CO2 increase and temp change is a natural log one. Basically if CO2 is doubled temp increases by 1 degree C.

Why isn't it being considered as the cause. Well because it's a cycle. The amount of water in the atmosphere a kind of constant due to this plus the fact that we don't actively pump water into the atmosphere like we do CO2. Although more water may end up in the atmosphere due to the rising temperatures exacerbating the problem. We are pumping CO2 in the atmosphere faster than plants can sequester it hence a net gain of CO2. \nRemember what the scientist said in this video? Solar irradiance exiting the earth is decreasing. All the while CO2 in the atmosphere (a known greenhouse gas) is also increasing. Correlation does not equal causation this is true, however combined with other evidences... it is looking more than likely that CO2 is the culprit.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Chavez Harding", "channel": "UCzPgO10Z72cbhCjIOrCNcdQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRZog6U9nPASig5Y5pMxJIHQt6OyFcUrcBahzC5xw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It was cancelled when Nixon cut funding for the AEC, and indicated that he wanted bomb making science.\nThe fast neutron wing began a project called the Integral Fast Reactor, and by April 1986 had a reactor that could reliably and safely breed its own fissile plutonium, given a starter charge of sufficiently enriched uranium, and continuously produce from U-238 as much Pu-239 as the fissile content it was consuming.\nIt could therefore be fed with, and consume, not only \"spent\" nuclear fuel, but even the uranium depleted of most of its fissile isotope by the \"enrichment\" process, amounting to about nine tenths of the original chemically purified uranium or its fluoride or oxide.\nThe molten salt reactor res ipse dixit will not melt down, it's molten as long as it's running, when that stops, it would go solid,  except that there's a fusible plug, that melts when power fails or is shut off, and drops the entire fuel content into a basin designed to arrest the chain reaction, and let it go solid.\nBy deliberate test, three weeks before Chernobyl, the IFR' s EBR-2 was deliberately tested by shutting of the coolant pumping power, and it promptly shut down and continued to cool the waste products by convection.\n\nThe essential waste from both of these technologies is short-lived, because the allegedly deadly long lived waste that to date amounts to a mere 80 thousand tons or less in the USA is less than 4% fission products, which are short lived, plutonium, which is an excellent fuel, and the original uranium, most of it with a half life of 4500 million years, and the rest so evanescent that half of it becomes protactinium 231 in a mere  700 million years.\nThe radioactivity of any isotope, in becquerels, is inversely proportional to the half life.

Your skepticism doesn't mean anything if you have neither the ability to understand nor criticise the work. Flat earthers are skeptical as well and they claim their skepticism tells them gravity doesn't exist, the sun is 3000 miles up in the sky, the earth is flat. Then you have the skepticism of those who claim there are lizard people who can shape shift. Skepticism is constantly employed in science by those who have the skills to employ it and use it correctly, not by some randoms on YouTube making nonsensical claims.\n\nWe have established processes to lay the foundation for how science is done, a massive part of that peer review. You can't flout those central principles of the scientific process then claim that any dismissal of your nonsense is \"appeal to authority\". As stated before appeal to authority only works if an unsubstantiated opinion is stated. Scientists who've spent decades studying in great depth their field of study can substantiate their views and have. Pointing out the great deal of work that goes into this and the clear rift between them and Tony is not an appeal to authority it's a stating of the obvious. You consider the comparison valid because you have no understanding of the work and no appreciation for the science. I point out the comparison because I have a younger brother at Oxford in his 4th year of studying quantum gravity reading for his doctoral thesis. I have a masters in topology of the universe. \n\nThis idea that somehow a flat earther can understand physics to the same degree as I do given they aren't formally trained and to treat their claims as worthy of some merit  is as ridiculous as taking Tony seriously. Tony makes videos for a reason, because 1) he isn't trained in the science 2) he appeals to laymen like you. If he had any credibility he would have made something of himself and relied on the scientific method for his criticism.\n\nMaking videos on YouTube is not a valid scientific criticism. Your blatant use of appeal to authority can be used and applied to anything. A pilot can fly a plane better than someone who isn't trained - appeal to authority! We went to space - appeal to authority! Aircrafts fly due to Bernoulli's principle - appeal to authority! \n\nAt the heart of if you're anti science and have not the faintest idea about the rigour and training it takes to be a scientist, or the diligence.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Jonathan Xavier", "channel": "UCx6MST6wSvWATEiRPgUfGwg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR84-pEFbI-uH12j49IY3THCz_gKuqZ4MCaBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

WORSE CASE  we give the keys to the whitehouse to the kotchs butt boy ... mr Donald I could pick any hair piece and I still choose to looke like this trump .. and he told chieny to go out and shoot all the scientist in the world in the face and the crazy closet queers diside to launch a preemptive strike against nature and nuke the ice caps .. even after ALL that ... most of new York will still be here ... florida will lose its erection and about half its size ... and most of the places that get flooded were inhabited by liberals and poor people  anyway .. and even though of the 8% were losing .. most of it is big city /farmland/fishing transport .. and it will cut our ability to grow food by 25% by 2050 .. at a time when we will actually need doublle what we got now .. managed the way it is of course ... if your rich or live in the mountains .. what the U&^$ do you care ??.. heck if anything its just getting rid of compition .. think about it .. they could get on board ... stop make all that money ... and work hard and sacrifice ... all so some guy who live on a tiny island whos name I cant pronounce ... all so he  dosnt lose his little fishing hut  and can raise some more ugly kids to take his place ...  or... or... we could pretend we don't see nothin ... brace ourselves .. then hen the word economys all collapse .. with 50%  unemployment world wide ,,, u can come in now and buy up all that property at a almost criminal discount !! open a factory right there where to public works used to be .. buy all the equipment ... exept the safty crap lol unless OCEA says we need it .. then hire the workers back at half there original wage .. no bennifits .. and make  sure  to do everything you can to make life as fdiffulcult  as possible for as many people as you can .. then be rewarded by the fact you have a billion dollar trust fund .. as wll as enough propprty and other wealth that the is no economic deprestion that can hurt me!! I can litteraly just sit and do nothing for 30 years ... I have no sence of urgentcy !! and yes .. you could say I earned it ... or at the very least SOMBODY earned it ... and heck I have sooo much of this stuff we call money ... that by making it worth nothing exept what I say its worth ... ie gtting rid of a gold or silver standard .. giving our money  physical value .. something that nomatter how many bills they print .. each bill is  still worth that same amount of gold !!... if I'm a rich banker ... why do I want that ?? that puts a physical limit on what I can do... I mean I can only print so many dollars before people figure out there isn't that much gold anywhere ....  no.. I want to basicly OWN all the money in the world ... and the only way I can do that .. is to make it worthless .. or atleast have no physical value ... that means that there is no outside force keeping me from just say . printing 2x as much money this year and giving half of it to myself and my friends !! aww but you say wait a sec ?? where is this NEW money coming from?? I mean  before when money was attached to gold .. you could only print so many dollars before you ran out of gold to back them up with .. .. they could say rint more bills worth less then one dollars worth of gold .. but that wont affect the bills alredy in your pocket !! those were worth 1 $ worth of gold when u got it .. and it will forever stay that way!! meaning that there were no inflation problems .. because even if a bunch of gold were discovered ,, making it less valuble .. your dollar is still the same ... now instead of say 1 ounce for a dollar .. you now get 2!! meaning that even though gold is worth less overall ... you still got the ORIGINAL VALUE  of your gold backed dollar ..  now if I take that away .. ha ha .. I basicly now OWN all dollars in circulation if I'm the bank that gets to print them!!! and yes I'm aware that the is some selection prosses at  the federal reserve .. making it not a entirely private corporation .. but it is STILL a private money making venture that is quit frankly  not even affective at its only real job .. ie supply the currency ... I never understood why we needed this .. central bank?? what does having one gain us ?? why is this not just something that can figured out in te open then writeen inn stone for all to see know and understand .. because fractional reserve banking is soo complicated that even they don't really know how this magic never ending economic groth spell is supposed to actually work and how its totally not a Ponzi schem on a national level ..  economics is  hard enough without using a intangible , everchanging , never the same twice comes with interest attached to it somhow fake worthless paper.. or .. a presious metal.. or even something like oil .. or even salt .. are all valubles that could be used to back our currency", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "russell backstrom", "channel": "UC_ljsnvnPxo7SmNqaM4EQ7g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSUtl9PLcISUbWQ6nrvoKUZKf88yfqz5d6prw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'll admit that your view sounds more appealing and has merit, that it's all natural, there's nothing we can do about it, and everything will get better on its own, but when you claim that all scientists who believe in global warming (roughly 97% of them) are just lying to try and line their pockets that's like saying we shouldn't trust any of our doctors either 'cause they're just greedy elites who're trying to steal our money too.\n\nThe ozone layer is not only affected by radiation (something humans have caused a lot of in the past century) but also plenty of man made chemicals like CFCs. The ozone layer has been steadily and drastically deteriorating for the past 50 years, and the kind of climate change you're saying is causing this takes place over the course of thousands of years.\n\nYour argument and the link you provided have given me much to consider (the greenhouse gasses for one) but frankly I'm just happy you accept that climate change exists, even if you believe it isn't man made. And for the record, I've never donated a single cent to any climate change fundraisers. I do my small part by mailing representatives and city council members to address this issue, or at least acknowledge that climate change exists. \n\nBut I guess we'll just have to wait for the next 75 or so years to see who was right. If the world is still in order you can say you told me so. If not, well... I'll still probably say I told you so.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Matthew Carson", "channel": "UCeJZhZlF_JaRgIcunWZG9OA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQoe8QpnF87Ybh_Isq6UveUUhumOJT1u5ZY2orv5Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugjt0fxH2zFCkngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-15g78otu6EM0fFY", "text": " @Matthew Carson  I agree with you the argument isn't about whether the climate is changing as climate is always changing at least where I live anyway. The question is : is man effecting climate change and I again agree with you yes he is but to what extent and in what way; \n are the questions up for debate. One statement I hear constantly is that 97% of scientists agree that climate change is man made. Where did this figure come from was a poll taken of all the Earth's scientists and this is where the figure came from. If so who conducted this poll and when ? If it was the UN  I would be very suspicious as the UN has not had any credibility in my opinion for many years, as they have their own world agenda and will stop at nothing to advance it. I also agree with many people that it would be beneficial to move away from fossil fuels and go to greener forms of energy like wind and solar. However this transition can not happen over night so in the interim we are going out have to resort to the use of fossil fuels until they can be totally phased out . The other question I have is I live in an area of extremely fluctuating temperatures ie: in the summer it can be up in the nineties and in the winter -40° degrees Celsius to date there has been no indication as to what is going to heat my home. I presently rely on natural gas and some electric , and I assume in a green world we will rely on electric heat powered by wind and solar. Is this going to work in the colder areas of Canada or am I still going to require  natural gas for backup as has been the case with the Geo thermal experiment which was in my opinion a scam and a farce also some snake oil salesmen went through our area and sucked a bunch of local farmers into wind energy and today I see none of them working and they never did. Then there is the question of costs. Presently our government or should I say Communist State presided over by Comrade Trudeau who has strong ties and a deep love of the UN is paying incentives to people wanting to go solar or a EV and so the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. Another problem I have with greenies is they are always saying that climate deniers are in the pocket of the oil companies well maybe some or all greenies are in the pockets of Tesla and solar and wind power companies I don't know if this is true just as I am sure they can't be sure about their opinions.Anyway what I do know is that there is a lot of money on both sides of the argument and money always trumps sensibility and honesty so hang on folks we are in for one hell of a ride.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Robert Tucker", "channel": "UC8A54SkCjqyaOWssFIlqj5w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRggWgwR591T2heTDcrC3X4J5IXOOiExl6M0w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugib1TIMO5bLLngCoAEC", "text": "I am writing to all Members of Congress to express my extreme displeasure in Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson’s treatment of Dr. James Hansen at last week’s Senate Foreign Relations Hearing.   I forced myself to watch the entire exchange, not once, but painfully twice.  It was clear from Senator Johnson’s performance that he was not looking to learn from one of America’s top climate scientists.\n\nEvery question the Senator asked was intended to tie Dr. Hansen to President Obama or Democratic positions.  Once the accusatory question was asked, Senator Johnson rudely interrupted Dr. Hansen’s attempt to answer.  At one point he said, “this is my question and answer session”; in effect saying shut-up.\n\nI know Dr. Hansen, and he’ll one day be recognized by the entire nation as an American hero.  He was the first modern-day scientist to explain climate change, and he suffered greatly for taking a stand.\n\nI’ve read his book – Storms of My Grandchildren: The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity – as well as most of his peer-reviewed scientific reports, and I’ve heard him speak on numerous occasions.\n\nDr. Hansen is a kind, gentle, caring human being. He knows the science of climate change, and he is in agreement with more-than 90 percent of the world’s scientific community.  Senator Johnson, however,  never asked about science. Senator Johnson attacked repeatedly and closed with his  unscientific politicized statement; “the science of climate change is not settled.”\n\nI have not slept well since watching this interchange.  \n\nI will turn 76 in June, and Senator Johnson brought back memories of the McCarthy hearings of the 50’s.  Those were some of the darkest days in our history, when safeguards promised by the Constitution were trampled, just as they are being trampled today.\n\nI  spent 22 years of my life in the military, including Vietnam, served as a project coordinator on the Safeguard/Sprint ABM system at Kwajalein, and ran the White House NAPO electronic bulletin board system remotely from my living room in the 90s.  Today I am a student, majoring in climate and environmental science.\n\nBecause of Dr. Hansen’s work, the National Academy of Sciences undertook its first major study of global warming in 1979.  They looked for flaws in Dr. Hansen’s work and found none.  The panel concluded that “If carbon dioxide continues to increase, climate changes will result.”  They went on to state there is “no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.”\n\nIn 2000, the C.I.A. reported in its “Global Trends 2015” that we would be facing environment issues in the future. In 2003, the American Geophysical Union, one of the nation’s largest and most respected scientific organizations, declared “Natural influences cannot explain the rapid increase in global near-surface temperatures . . . , and if current trends continue, by the end of the century it will likely be hotter than at any point in the last two million years.”\n\nToday the Pentagon says “climate change is the greatest risk to national security we face.” Institutions like the World Bank say we’re on the road to a 4-degree warmer world and catastrophe.\n\nHow is it possible that men like Senator Ron Johnson, with absolutely no training in science, are allowed to trample on the Constitutional rights of witnesses with years of scientific training and experience? Our grand children will inherit a world with food and water shortages and storms beyond anything we have ever experienced because of people like Senator Johnson.\n\nFrom what I observed of the exchange between Dr. Hansen and Senator Johnson, I have to speak up and say his performance is, and was, unacceptable behavior for an elected official, and if allowed to continue, then there is definitely something wrong with Congress.  If America finds Senator Johnson’s behavior acceptable, then there is something wrong with America.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Joanna Clark", "channel": "UCqs27cnm0BajzlsNAQsbpRg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSNFeMzNytC3qq2Y3N9ZyqHvatOvaLPrONkYcO3=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It has a diameter of about 1,392,684 km (865,374 mi), around 109 times that of Earth, and its mass (1.989×1030 kilograms, approximately 330,000 times the mass of Earth) accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.\" -WIKIPEDIA\n\n\"The corona is the extended outer atmosphere of the Sun, which is much larger in volume than the Sun itself. The corona continuously expands into space becoming the solar wind, which fills all the Solar System. The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015–1016 m−3. The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. While no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.\" -WIKIPEDIA\n\nSo while the W/m2 of the sun has only changed from 1365.2 to 1366 (0.8 or 0.05% of scale) this translates to between 1,799,540 to 1,800,440 F (difference of 900 Degrees F) and 35,999,540 to 36,017,540 (difference of 18,000 Degrees F) at the Corona of the Sun.\n\nYOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. There is no way a change of between 900 Degrees F and 18,000 Degrees F at the Sun could equate to 0.5 Degrees here on earth. BUT a change in atmospheric composition of 0.005% ABSOLUTELY is.. \n\nLOL. Global Warming, Global Cooling and Climate change is just another hoax made by para-scientists to get funding from crooked politicians that want to tax and regulate EVERYTHING.", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "tempersne", "channel": "UCzB68igJc5t7rJPvT7Ue6Ug", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT6UJbBl36MkOGHDZJaSXZfWCG-YM9WmweY2nzZ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But they are utterly mistaken, like far too many other environmentalist organizations, in their opposition to civilian nuclear power. In a way it is regrettable that even Bill Nye doesn't get it.\n\nIt should be manifestly futile to oppose civilian nuclear on the unlikely grounds that civilian nuclear waste can contribute to terrorist or national nuclear proliferation, when we now know that China, Russia, and even South Korea have plans to build and export modern reactors of a sort that the USA pioneered and dropped for idiotic political reasons.\n\nThe total amount of not-even-spent, used nuclear fuel in the USA amounts to less than 80 thousand tons, growing at a rate of about 25 hundred tons a year. 95% of it is the original uranium 238, so weakly radioactive that the lifetime of this planet so far is about the time it takes for half a sample of it to decay. There are two reactor designs that can consume the long-lived stuff, and Russia now has a \"breeder reactor\" that can do so, producing 800 MW of electric power. That's as much as 320 wind turbines of 2.5 MW nameplate rating can do, in the strongest wind they can survive, or the 12 metre/sec,  =27 mph force at which they begin to do so.\nTo get an average annual value of 800 MW takes at least three times as many turbines, and the blades themselves are slightly longer than 50 yards.

Timothy Wirth was one of the few politicians already concerned about global warming, and he was not above using a little stagecraft for Hansen's testimony.\nTIMOTHY WIRTH: We called the Weather Bureau and found out what historically was the hottest day of the summer. Well, it was June 6th or June 9th or whatever it was. So we scheduled the hearing that day, and bingo, it was the hottest day on record in Washington, or close to it.\nDEBORAH AMOS: [on camera] Did you also alter the temperature in the hearing room that day?\nTIMOTHY WIRTH: What we did is that we went in the night before and opened all the windows, I will admit, right, so that the air conditioning wasn't working inside the room. And so when the- when the hearing occurred, there was not only bliss, which is television cameras and double figures, but it was really hot.\nDr. Hansen, if you'd start us off, we'd appreciate it.\n\nThe wonderful Jim Hansen was wiping his brow at the table at the hearing, at the witness table, and giving this remarkable testimony.\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/etc/script.html\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/view/\n\nNow let's watch you do the \"Alarmist Two Step\" and dance out of this one.

The higher and more widespread temperatures are, the stronger they are and longer they can last. You warm the oceans, you get more intense hurricanes.

It doesn't matter how many you have. Plot away that there are a large number of days between hurricanes, that's understandable.

While the oceans (primarily), land, and atmosphere warm, it indicates equilibrium has not been reached. Not all the energy incoming from the Sun is balanced by out going radiation because it is being stored primarily in the oceans.\n\n2) He adds terms to his equation that cool the surface (e.g., evaporation and upward convection) but ignores the equivalent terms that heat the surface (e.g., condensation and downward convection) so his balance equation is no longer balanced. That is why the atmospheric temperature goes so much more negative in his unbalanced world.\n\n3) The observed albedo he uses (0.3)  is a measurement of the Earth's albedo so that will already contain any additional radiation from a warming atmosphere. By adding that in he is counting it twice.\n\n4) He keeps saying that the Sun's radiation is the only source of incoming energy. That is not true, the others though very small (<<1%) include: internal heat from the Earth, cosmic rays, magnetic energy, star light, cosmic background radiation ....)\n\n5) He is confusing primary forcing agents (GHGs and aerosols) with secondary ones that only amplify temperature changes (up or down). These include water vapour content in the air, albedo change, surface emissivity changes (i.e., land use changes), etc.\n\n6) He claims that \"nobody is looking at these factors\", which is untrue they are widely discussed in the literature and so are prominent in the IPCC report (\"for example \"land use\" is mentioned 40 times in just the technical summary for Working group 1 (Science).\n\n7) He validates his model by saying it comes up with the same temperature sensitivity (1.4C) for a doubling of CO2 as does the fancier models. Unfortunately that is no the case, the value obtained by the models is near 3C.\n\n8) He shows a graph of CO2 levels and temperature going back billions of years to show no correlation by claiming it is \"the same planet\" but it wasn't. The sun was a different intensity, the continents, mountain and ocean currents were all in different places so weather and climate patterns were very different, there was more volcanic and meteorite activity, and the atmosphere did not have the same benign (for us) composition as did does now, ie CO2 was not the only agent. For most of the time the only life form was bacteria.\n\n9) He dodged the question on extinction during the Permian being caused by climate changes by using that same graph and saying \"we don't know what went on back then\" so on one hand he is relying on it for his arguments for CO2 not being linked to temperature but then says it is unreliable ... a trifle inconsistent?\n\nAnd those are just some of them .....", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "drkstrong", "channel": "UCIp0KTgnQNZJIOQZqrVDw1g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTrCiToKdD_ctHs2I3FrWjOI4SArd62fq95fJx4=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Sea ice extent remained more extensive than average within Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay. While the ice extent remained overall higher than in 2012, this is largely a result of the higher extent within Baffin and Hudson bays. Despite average sea ice extent within the Beaufort Sea, higher resolution passive microwave satellite imagery from AMSR-2 and visible-band imagery from MODIS (Figure 6) reveals that the ice has become rather diffuse (low ice concentrations) with many large broken ice floes surrounded by open water.\"It seems that in the Hudson bay the extent is larger (extent is an area where the sea is covered by more than 15% of ice) but is more diffuse, i.e. a larger area covered with lower concentrations of ice.

Thus if you removed all water vapour from the air it would get colder for a while but the other GHGs would maintain the ambient temperature and the humidity levels would rise again in a day or two. However if you removed all the other GHGs from the atmosphere the water vapour levels would drop too and not recover. The Earth would eventually become 34 degrees colder on average than it is now. \n\nIt is just simple physics.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "drkstrong", "channel": "UCIp0KTgnQNZJIOQZqrVDw1g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTrCiToKdD_ctHs2I3FrWjOI4SArd62fq95fJx4=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Actually what you need to look at is the mean free path of a photon at a critical wavelength to understand this problem better. In the Earth's atmosphere for an IR photon typically emitted by the Earth it is about 70m. Which means on average an IR photon travels 70m before hitting a CO2 molecule and being re-emitted in a random direction (scattered). At the beginning of the industrial revolution that distance used to be about 100m. So the mean free path is much shorter than it used to be so to escape the Earth's atmosphere an average IR photon has to undergo many more scatterings on its random walk (look it up) to get to escape the Earth.That makes the Earths atmosphere extremely optically thick to these wavelengths and that is a whole different type of physics. The equations become very complex depending on the type of scattering involved (Rayleigh, resonance scattering, Raman, etc) and sometimes angle dependent. They are consequently statistically based, unlike the optically thin (e.g., the solar corona) or where the optical depth is about 1 (the solar photosphere for example) \n\nPS part of my thesis was about optical depths and light scattering, so I am well qualified to call \"nonsense\" on this topic when I see it. In fact I got my green card to work in the US as \"one of the world's leading experts on resonance scattering\" according the INS.
