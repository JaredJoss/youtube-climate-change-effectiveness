Now imagine yourself as a bear, you grew up in a place where you can die from a variety of different things and bipedal hairless primates don't just drop food around and if you find a dead carcass you wouldn't just assume that bipedal creatures just dropped it there, you'll just think that they died from other causes so you won't become human dependent.

Since the mass of oxygen weighs more than three times as much as carbon, burning just two pounds of wood yields over eight pounds of CO2.\n[1 pound carbon + 3.6 pounds oxygen + 3.6 pounds oxygen = 8.2 pounds of carbon dioxide]\n\nNote: Trees, as they grow, re-absorb carbon dioxide from the air; but, with increasing deforestation, desertification, soil degradation, et al, CO2 levels in the biosphere are increasing (especially when you factor in the burning of stupendous amounts of previously sequestered carbon in the form of fossil fuels).\n\nThis strengthens the greenhouse effect and results in a steadily warming planet. And with each and every year being warmer than the years before, how is it that only the blissfully ignorant and the hopelessly naive fail to see what the future holds?\n\nSearch:\n‚Äòcarbon cycle global warming‚Äô\n\nResource:\n‚ÄúGreenhouse Effect‚Äù Physics-¬†\n62 part series.¬†\n‚Ä™https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2gX-ftPVXUNpoyWX5PeZQy5CNlPh0r3‚Ä¨\n\nSearch:\n‚Äòsamslair blogspot AGW‚Äô", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sam Lair", "channel": "UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHI0ofAQcclqyQYWFUekfrl6JC9l_6ODYX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzdP1tJn34wcLYugL14AaABAg", "text": "Weird. How do I interpret the information I will share below, and what do I do with it? What is the actual truth when everything contradicts everything else?\nThe video you all just saw was made in September, when the polar ice is at it's minimum. The documentary admittedly picked this one bear in bad shape and didn't show others in close proximity. It was debunked on numerous occasions, even unintentionally by National Geographics documentary made later that year. \n\n[edit] \nScott Sound\n9 hours ago\nIt was Sick not starving ............ \n\nExactly.\n[/edit]\n\nAfter the announcement that in March 2017 the ice shrunk to it's record low since 1979, NASA gave the next statement in December: polar ice back to 1979 levels, record high thickness recorded. Articles published in October of 2017 claiming the same were declared false. Same happened in 2014, and Here's what Forbes writes later on the subject: \"Updated data from NASA satellite instruments reveal the Earth‚Äôs polar ice caps have not receded at all since the satellite instruments began measuring the ice caps in 1979. Since the end of 2012, moreover, total polar ice extent has largely remained above the post-1979 average.\" The article was now removed due to: failing to meet the editorial standards\". One of the latest NASA statement says the thickest ice is at second latest recorded minimum while another, a few months apart shows the thickest ice is growing in thickness since 2014 and is record high for the past decade. Another thing, National Geographics, Feb. 1st 2018. \"Polar Bears Really Are Starving Because of Global Warming, Study Shows\", where the previous NG estimated population of polar bears was 21000, all other estimates were 26000, while estimates given by biologists were 31000 in 2015 (PBaC, PBSG, PBI and IUCN) with the margin of error that puts the minimum above 28000. In the winter of 2018/2019 the record high of polar bear population was recorded, and even Inuit chiefs asked the Canadian government to intervene due to polar bear attacks increasing by over 300%, and to quote one of Inuit leaders: They are EVERYWHERE. Meanwhile PBI deleted the original 2015 data and replaced it with 23000 in 2018, and conveniently, their funding got raised after that. PBI also now calls the polar bear population rising a myth (Dr. Steven C. Amstrump, USGS polar bears project leader). Extrapolated data from all mentioned suggests the polar bear population in 2019 was, on average 39000. For comparison, the largest estimate in the 60s was in 1964-1966 at 10000, while others ranged from 5000 to 8000. \"Official\" statistics still claim the polar bear population decrease ranging from 30% to 60%. Canadian Geographics research shows the population increase of 233% since the 70s. University of Alberta gives an estimate as high as 40000 with minimum of 36000, while some credible estimates go as high as 52000 and some not credible as high as 60000. If we would observe all 19 subpopulations of polar bears, only one has a decrease in the past few years, while having an increase for the past 50 years, 4-7 are steady, depending on study, and the data for the rest (usually 9 but goes as high as 12) are replaced with: outaded or unreliable, and not giving exact numbers anymore, since 2017, and since August 2019, the data from as far back as 2012 was also replaced as outdated or unreliable (one can easily compare the currently available articles and statistics with archived ones).\nWT actual F?!", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "milllosh", "channel": "UCbQyEMBb-gr211hmrDMKjIQ", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSViUxjjggQE_dZIHmOR_pkFhQAkQLBNKw5TvgH=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

His use of an obviously Photoshopped picture of apathetic polar bear on an ice float suggests this. As Susan Crockford, aspecialist in polar bear evolution, points out, there had indeed been a significant decrease in polar bear population in the past due to hunting and before that due to commercial exploitation of polar bear fur. This led to successful protective measures and sufficient recovery of polar bear population, so that hunting is again permitted.13 There is no evidence that changes in summer sea ice have had any adverse impact on polar bear population, and, given that polar bears can swim for over a hundred miles there seems to be little reason to suppose that it would. Nonetheless, for the small community of polar bear experts, the climate-related concerns have presented an obvious attraction.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "waldo99ish", "channel": "UCKV5XV9fccZfk75c638SLKw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTJNgjeqfwZTKwkQ0Hokr5bE2yTTb2T-XYdPA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Their mandate is to study HUMAN caused change, so other elements involved in change they say they are not studying.

Also we have taken their food by over fishing. What we need is a huge decrease in population. Maybe a world war or a famine or perhaps stop the African nations having too many children. China will keep exporting millions of products we don't really need and you still want your new car and other luxuries. Let's face it unless we reduce our population the poor animals will all be extinct except, of course, the ones we eat. One day when humans eventually are no longer on this planet, and that day will come, maybe in thousands or millions of years, the animal species will eventually reign again.

Global warming is something that is happening, but it is something that is not created by our emissions of fossil fuels, it is just the natural cycle of our planet.  During the Cambrian era, atmospheric CO2 was around 7000 ppm or parts per million, compared to the atmosphere today which has a little over 400 ppm of atmospheric CO2.  Additionally, the average temperature on our planet currently is 14 degrees Celsius, while it has been over 25 degrees celsius before.  The Earth undergoes cycles in temperature, and we are currently heading out of an ice age, so the polar caps are natural going to be melting and temperatures are going to be increasing.  The mainstream media will bring up the receding ice caps many times, misinforming audiences, because for millions of years there have been no ice caps on this planet, and life has still thrived.  Climate change is real, but is not caused by our CO2 emissions.  It is just a natural cycle on the Earth that will affect the environment around us, but since life was first on Earth species have died off and new ones have emerge.

In the late 1800s there were 100,000 tigers. There are now only 3,500 left in the wild. There are only around 4,000 rhinos. There are only about 800 Mountain Gorillas. None have perished because of climate change. For over a hundred years plants and animals have been decimated resulting from habitat loss and poaching. The climate change movement doesn't care. Humans do exponentially more damage than global warming ever will. In 2016 humans slaughtered 100,000,000 sharks. That isn't a typo. I doubt a single shark has died from climate change. If the Polar bear goes extinct, It will be because of human encroachment not climate change. Grizzly bear habitat is actually expanding because of climate change. Humans as usual encroach on grizzly bear habitat pushing them further and further north where they are able to survive because of a warming planet. Don't tell this to the climate change zealots though. Every predator on earth dies of starvation. They get old and can no longer hunt or defend themselves.

You cannot question someones intellect based on what you think they might've be talking about. I haven't mentioned polar bear populations at all but let's just say I did; one of the most frequent myths about polar bears is that their numbers are increasing. I'm guessing this is something you've just heard or quickly read over and not studied. Population data dates back to the 60's. \nScientists today can't rely on that loose data to determine the actual population at that time. It's not accurate and so you can't work with it. The most important point is that whatever happened in the past is really irrelevant. Polar bear habitat is disappearing due to global warming today and that poses huge threats to their future on this planet.

The snows of Kilimanjaro have melted more than 80 percent since 1912. Glaciers in the Garhwal Himalaya in India are retreating so fast that researchers believe that most central and eastern Himalayan glaciers could virtually disappear by 2035. Arctic sea ice has thinned significantly over the past half century, and its extent has declined by about 10 percent in the past 30 years. NASA's repeated laser altimeter readings show the edges of Greenland's ice sheet shrinking. Spring freshwater ice breakup in the Northern Hemisphere now occurs nine days earlier than it did 150 years ago, and autumn freeze-up ten days later. Thawing permafrost has caused the ground to subside more than 4.6 meters in parts of Alaska. From the Arctic to Peru, from Switzerland to the equatorial glaciers of Man Jaya in Indonesia, massive ice fields, monstrous glaciers, and sea ice are disappearing, fast. \n\nWhen temperatures rise and ice melts, more water flows to the seas from glaciers and ice caps, and ocean water warms and expands in volume. This combination of effects has played the major role in raising average global sea level between 10 and 20 centimeters in the past hundred years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC).\n\nAre you going to deny significant sea level rise?

First off, about the Earth going through natural cycles of climate change, yes that is totally true. However, the effects of that natural change are extremely slow, and if it was just the natural change occurring we would not see any difference in over 100 years. But in the last 100 years we have seen a gigantic difference. I myself am born and raised in Alaska, and have seen the effects first hand. It no longer stays cold throughout the whole winter. We get random warm spells in the middle of December and all the snow melts. My grandpa has told me how when he was a kid it was below zero nonstop for weeks on end in Anchorage. I've seen it get below zero a handful of times there. As far as scientist being controlled by the government, that is just simply bullshit. The goal of scientists is to prove each other wrong and discover new things, because doing that = money. But all scientists of any kind with any kind of real education agree that climate change is very real. I don't know why people like you choose to ignore the truth. There is an EXACT correlation with the amount of carbon emissions and the rise of global temperatures. Do you ignore it because you think not using fossil fuels will ruin the economy or something? The way an economy works is that as a product becomes less efficient and ethical, a new product replaces it, and the people who worked on making the first product transition into jobs making the new one. This has happened over and over throughout history. It's people like you who do nothing but divide this country & the world by spouting ignorance.
