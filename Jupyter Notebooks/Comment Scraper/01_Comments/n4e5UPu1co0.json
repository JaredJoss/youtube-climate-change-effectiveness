{"cid": "UgzgjbX4-cmQDR8GT_x4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

{"cid": "UgzOJ_-VRkNMbhdRIN54AaABAg", "text": "lol The United States is burning up to smithereens and people are saying there is no evidence of what this young lady Greta THUNBERG is talking about? lol If you get out if your own way of your own ignorance and research just on the weekend you'd be floored as to what's really going on. \nLook up the YouTube video of a scientist who has been recording the North Pole ice caps melting for 35 years and they speed the recording so believers and non-believers can wake up when they see a HUGE glaciers melt down fast to an ice cube and then down to nothing and that's the  water that is flooding cites around the world. We will never flood as in the days of Noah but we are flooding due to the greed of the rich Elite. The United States of America and the world is flooding, take your head out of the social media and Fake News and just look on YouTube. People from around the U.S. and the world are recording the flooding and posting it. \nLook up the lawsuits around the world that common folks are suing these companies that PROFIT from creating these clouds. One of the videos on YouTube is called \n\"We are suing these B@stards\" it is not misspelled. If people just take the time to research a little they'll get a rude awakening and if they love their families they'll be leaving behind, they will stand up and fight thenega rich people who only care about their money that they can't take with them when they die. Thank God people are fighting back. \nI know a lot because I am a cancer survivor. I beat cancer naturally ( which including 3 blood transfusion). I studied cancer for 5 years and eventually beat it. Thank God. \n\nI know what I know by default because I wanted to live and not do Chemotherapy and managed to survive. \nI know that they have the cure for most cancers in 45 days. but the FDA won't approve it because they SAY THEY WANT MORE TRIALS, MEANWHILE people are dying like flies from cancer but they want more data when the FDA allows toxic chemicals in our food and change the trial periods on the toxic food just to allow them to use in in our food and they shorten the regulations on bit just to pass the sticker toxic chemicals so that they can make money on us. \nDo you know what a 45 day cure would have done for me or anyone else with cancer. Look up stem cell therapy. Do you know the FDA didn't want to approve it to add Cartledge when people suffer from  bone on bone due to bad eating habits and hard work that over the years wear down to nothing. Theyve  been knowing about longevity and the fountain of youth for over 35 Years but just like there's no money in the cure, there's no money in helping people stay healthy. \nI lost almost 12 years of my life trying to cure myself and recoup from being sick for 7 years with cancer. I wouldn't have lost my house and my successful trucking business. Look up the \"Vice\" show \"The new cancer cure\" something a long those lines. They recorded a man who has stage 4 brain Cancer- and theyget rid of it within 45 days. Brain Cancer; is one of the hardest Cancers because the Brain is on a different lymphatic system than the rest of our body. John McCain died of brain Cancer- and not even him was privy to the stem cell cure, not even on a trail basis and that's sad and ridiculous when the man served our country in the war and the powers that be don't even respect that. Wouldn't you be mad if you or a loved one had cancer and was dying and you KNEW there was an easier way or a less TOXIC way to curing cancer than going the chemotherapy route which is a horrendous route to take? \nThere's a lot of ways to make a difference rather than posting here on things you know nothing about. I'm an older woman and I fight for my children, my grandchildren and the young people who are dying with cancer in unprecedented numbers. I fight the Medical system that pumping opiates to the AMERICAN public for injuries, depression, you name it, any excuse just to get us hooked (when years ago the doctors prescribed counseling and Psychotherapy of some kind and not opiates) for attention span deficit disorder they prescribe Ritalin to children and that is criminal because most opiates are a derivatives of crack cocaine, crystal meth or heroin (look up the side affects of Ritalin on a child). When my daughter was 10 years old, her elamentary teacher and the school psychologist had  recommended  Ritalin by her elamentary school  teacher and I refused. I was 28 years old at the time and I laughed and said  absolutely not!!! I told them \"you aren't getting my daughter on drugs cuz you have too many kids to handle, they said my daughter isn't focused and she gets off her seat and visits her classmates too many times. I told them my daughter is a social butterfly and I will talk to her about  that but you aren't drugging up my daughter and turning her into a zombie cuz you can't handle your class.Today my daughter is a successful Beatty salon owner in Los Angeles tht make at least $200,000 per year and If I would have listen to them my daughter would be strung out on drugs or Dead by an overdose. She is 40 years old now. \nI'm not asleep, never have been since I was a child. God has blessed me with knowledge and foresight on issues that affect us today. It is a gift and a blessing. \nWake up, before you are knee deep in the murky Waters or your house is on fire literally. Come on dud!, the Amazon is on fire and we can't afford for that to happen. \nThe rich get richer and the poor get poorer, we have got to try and stop the crooks from killing us and doing us in just for PROFIT.\nWhat you also don't know is the mist clouds/Haze/JUNK that surrounds the mountains aren't Real clouds, they are geoengineered clouds that are toxic and making us sick like dogs and even killing us. Whatever we are suffering from it's in our food and it in the CLOUDS. The soot that falls on our cars are the TOXIC CHEMICALS clouds and an attorney NEEDS TO GET A COPY OF THE LAWSUIT THAT THE VIETNAM WAR VETS WON A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT because they sprayed them with Agent Orange. Get that lawsuit and compare the chemicals soot on our cars and in our veins and the soot is all over the trees. We need to get a copy of the lawsuit and compare it to what they sprayed the Vets with. Soldiers are still dying today behind the Spraying they did way back then. A chemical engineer told me we were being SPRAYED with Bio warfare. It's population CONTROL. \nSome Attorney needs to do something", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Gmmonica godsgotthis", "channel": "UC6qlFL1HwMvEbHFLJzR-mWw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTO56yWdIpeLjkukB5Ft1xnM3dpFk1LY2vIZw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzB4qPJrd6mhHDGOPV4AaABAg.8oPaovZGY1_8qhcimyJ_dl", "text": "John Doran, much of what you wrote is true, but you got some things wrong, starting with this: \"man-made CO2 is not one of them.\"\r\n\r\nManmade CO2 is one of them.\r\n\r\nHuman activity has raised CO2 levels by about 46%, even though it is technically true that only a very small percentage of the CO2 in the atmosphere was produced by man. That sounds like a contradiction, but it isn't.\r\n\r\nThe claim that only a very small percentage (perhaps 4%, but I don't recall) of the CO2 in the atmosphere was produced by man is based on isotope studies, which distinguish \"fossil\" carbon (from burning fossil fuels) because it contains almost no radioactive 14C. However, isotope studies don't work well for estimating CO2 emission effects, because isotope ratios are greatly affected by the enormous fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere and other carbon reservoirs. Even when such fluxes are balanced, so that they don't affect atmospheric CO2 level, they still can greatly effect the carbon isotope ratios.\r\n\r\nCarbon isotopes are fungible for most purposes. The low 14C \"fossil\" carbon we put into the atmosphere is (nearly) bio-equivalent to high-14C carbon, so the plants take up whichever CO2 molecules they encounter. Likewise, the oceans are happy to dissolve either kind of carbon dioxide. So the atmospheric CO2 is constantly being exchanged with carbon in plants, animals, soil, and oceans.\r\n\r\nSo, even though our CO2 emissions have elevated atmospheric CO2 levels by about 130 ppmv (about 46%), there's been only a modest drop in 14C percentage (other than the famous 14C bomb spike). That's not because our emissions aren't responsible for the increase in CO2 level, it's because most of the low-14C CO2 we put into the atmosphere has been exchanged for other CO2 in the oceans or biosphere.\r\n\r\nIt's as if you had $280 in common $1 bills, and I gave you another $130 in Sacagaweas. At that point, almost 1/3 of your money would be in coins. But then you go play poker all night. You break even, so you still walk out with the same amount of money that you started with ($410), but now you have only a few Sacagaweas, because most of them have been exchanged for other people's money.  (The dollars are analogous to ppmv of CO2, of course.)\r\n\r\nThe best evidence is that manmade global warming is modest and benign, but it isn't \"zero to negligible.\"\r\n\r\nHere's were you can learn more about climate change:\r\nhttps://tinyurl.com/learnmore4\r\n\r\nHere's a graph of the 14C \"bomb spike\":\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G79oXdgIZC4/UnteTCVaGGI/AAAAAAAAAA0/AbSzY3s5ZP0/s1600/logc14.jpg", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "David Burton", "channel": "UC7SuPFd0W50tfE-zpVFz5cw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRp7UsZZAgN_1JrhBH_GztgMjuNI9SfpjIsvusE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Uggb4emOqwhV0HgCoAEC.8ODS9sjXaCA8ytUjKf3ezr", "text": "Because the atmosphere is becoming more opaque to infra-red, the parts that actually successfully radiate to space are actually higher in the atmosphere. This is the notional 'top of atmosphere' which is at the Earth's 'effective temperature', around 255 K. The temperature gradient (technically called the 'lapse rate') stays about the same - the atmosphere cools by about 6 K per km vertically. Therefore the surface and lower atmosphere warm.\nhttps://youtu.be/CqjbTMz5Hro\n\n(Another, possibly simpler but less technically accurate, way of answering that question is to think about why the surface gets hotter. The surface receives energy from solar radiation and has to shed that as infra-red to stay the same temperature, as in the video. That is, the temperature of the surface will be the equilibrium temperature, where the incoming solar radiation matches the net infra-red emission. Because with more greenhouse gases it's more difficult to radiate successfully all the way to space without those infra-red rays being absorbed, the surface has to get hotter. Only that way does enough emitted radiation get through the thicker blanket of greenhouse gases. http://www.howglobalwarmingworks.org/35-words.html As scientists calculated in the nineteenth century, without any greenhouse effect, the average temperature of the Earth couldn't be warmer than -18 ¬∞C or zero ¬∞F)\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases, or simplified as 'heat cannot of itself pass from one body to a hotter body': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnbiVw_1FNs \n\nEntropy of course increases because the energy from a small number of localised light photons from the sun is converted by the Earth into a larger number of scattered infra-red photons. And net heat passes from the Sun to the Earth's surface, then to the atmosphere, then to space. Don't misread the second law as meaning the colder atmosphere cannot emit heat radiation down to the ground - it must do, or all nights would be well below freezing. It's just that more heat is radiated from the surface to the atmosphere than vice versa. The sun sends light and infrared energy in the direction of the star Rigel A, even though Rigel is hotter.\n\nSo not quite sure what you're asking about ignoring the second law. If you follow physical law, such as equations for radiation or conduction, the second law emerges necessarily as a statistical property. You don't need to consider it when, for example, building bridges or even designing a heat pump.\n\nTurns out that the idea that the greenhouse effect (which no scientist disputes) somehow violates the second law of thermodynamics is a common myth brought up in confusions about climate change. Explaining in different words, in basic and intermediate versions: http://sks.to/thermo The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are like a blanket or coat that keeps you warmer even though it's not itself a source of heat. (The means of heat transfer from the Earth is radiation, because of course convection and conduction don't apply in space. Loss of heat from your body is more likely conduction. But otherwise the analogy is good.)\n\nThe more interesting and important question of course it what we're going to do about it.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Cedders001", "channel": "UCTy-XAyHBfp9BMoRXJt9JDg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT4ujXkoFNO-UFxpc0XoiKpwNxS41zU4NjsqQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The big 2015-2016 El Nino put an end to \"The Pause\" in global warming. It is still clear that the rate of warming has slowed, however. \n\nClimate activists often use various tricks to exaggerate global warming. One common trick is to cherry-pick a starting point for their regressions between the 1997-1998 El Ni√±o and the 1999-2000 La Ni√±a.\n\nIf you start your regression either before or after that pair of ENSO events, it's hard to avoid noticing the \"slowdown\" in warming, compared to the 1980s and early 1990s. But if you carefully choose a starting point just as ENSO transitioned from El Nino to La Nina, you'll low-bias the left endpoint, by including the La Nina in your regression and excluding the El Nino, which effectively hides the decline in the rate of warming.\n\nhttps://www.ggweather.com/enso/oni.png\n\nHere're a couple of excerpts about the slowdown in warming, from a National Academy of Sciences booklet (the source is in fine print at the bottom):\nhttps://sealevel.info/nas_booklet_excerpts_about_slowdown_in_warming_pp_7_and_12.png", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "David Burton", "channel": "UC7SuPFd0W50tfE-zpVFz5cw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRp7UsZZAgN_1JrhBH_GztgMjuNI9SfpjIsvusE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The environmentalists and some scientists wanted the term \"climate change\" dumbed down for Joe average.   As a quite young student aiming for a career in science but very interested in environmetalism I recall being dubious about this, thinking it would backfire because people would think it meant that the weather in various places would be too warm all over the planet, rather than that the planet ITSELF was 1 degree warmer ((give or take) on average.

They describe four possible climate futures, all of which are considered possible depending on how much greenhouse gases are emitted in the years to come. The four RCPs, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5, are named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W/m2, respectively).\n\nThe increase in temperatures quoted in the video are RCP 8.5. So unrealistic as to be risible. Plus the climate models cannot \"project\" their way to anything close to actual temperatures. The initial proposition of the IPCC that climate was a non-linear, chaotic system that could not be predicted, is much closer to reality than all of the hype that is currently being proposed by most alarmists.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Sueezedtight", "channel": "UC0j0qByuSH9dg8XiLBcP_SQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRiGeh_CDqYNiTHtCAucplS7uelF-hsGy9hZJtg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
