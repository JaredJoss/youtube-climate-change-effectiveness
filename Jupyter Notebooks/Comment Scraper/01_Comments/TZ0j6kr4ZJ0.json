What humans do is a grain of sand in the larger scheme of things. A single discharge or burp of a volcano emits more CO2 then the history of human civilization. CO2 is responsible for record plant and tree growth in recent years, it does warm the Earth but plant growth also cools it making it not as much a factor as volcanic activity. Until we can control plate tectonics and volcanoes, we can never control global warming or cooling. A carbon tax and these government agendas are profit making machines. If the spokespeople for global warming were at all worried about it then why would Obama and Al Gore etc etc buy beach front property. Why would banks give loans for Beach front property if it was imminent? People that claim to be helping only get rich off of us while promoting panic.

Sea level in Sydney is rising at 0.65mm per year and it seems that Fort Denison is itself sinking at a rate of around 4mm per year which leaves a true rate of rise of around 0.15mm per year or less than an inch per century, and  is not the reason for the encroachment of the ocean on the Pacific Islands.

Global warming/climate change will not kill off all life, nor all humans. But it WILL disrupt many, will cost much money, and will kill some (up to max 10% of) people. Just as the Kiribaas have planned to relocate to Fiji (their gov't already bought land for that), many forward-thinking people are working in many ways/areas, to protect vulnerable populations. And in 30 years we'll need again more strict measures - and again another 30 years after that even more strict limits... until we eliminate most of our carbon-polluting. The core problem is, the poorest (and the most foolish) will suffer, even die. And it's fully unfair to punish the poorest/most innocent people/nations. We in the west need to change, and take responsibility. This requires accords -- and newer accords -- every 10 years, which each adjust targets/goals.\n\nAny \"Plan for Escape\" is untenable! Where will we escape to? All other planetary bodies have more severe problems than our Terrestrial global warming. Also, let's focus, and never attack our own/thinking people who are on the \"correct side\" (solutions-oriented side) of this global problem. We must also educate (vigorously) the deniers!!! Things are NOT \"too late\". Climate science documented many recent instances of the Earth \"healing\" itself, although slowly -- and yes many ppl will still suffer. But as long as we fix our Carbon-polluting behaviors within the next ~100 years, it will not go into an irreparable/catastrophic cycle. Scientists have seen that every time we've corrected our carbon-polluting behaviors (during the last 30 years), the Earth repaired parts of its atmosphere within 5-10 years (but not entirely repaired - full self-repair will require longer times). Extremist/alarmist views is the same as infighting (attacking ourselves) - which effectively attacks scientists. Top experienced climate scientists do believe we have at least 3+ decades of time, though we must do more ASAP.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Who knew ···", "channel": "UCG91mFDxbYp-0atY5-Qtjkg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRL3Lndm14ae2s_wqACLdNu_wt9qHFY-nxvdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Because it is the nature of things and nature changes going through cycles humans have very little effect on that.\nIt is remarkably arrogant to think that we have that much control over the climate that again has been changing since the dawn of time and will continue to change until the end of time. Because the Earth is as alive as we are.\nIt is how the lands have changed in millions of years creating the mountains that move 2\" per year, creating the Mariana trench which is constantly changing, creating the ice age.\nIt's also really pathetic to try to change your atmosphere to beat mother nature because she is going to wipe you away. Instead of fighting mother nature you should have respect for her and pick up and move from the places that she no longer wants you to be... Humans need to learn how to adapt to their world, instead of trying to make their world adapt to them. Mother nature will win every time. Nature is far smarter than Humanity.\nMore proof of this is in the fact that islands have risen and fallen in the sea since the beginning of time.

Ancient volcanoes are no longer building those islands. Every rain, every storm, every breeze, every wave and every tide is washing them away. Look at these islands. All sand. How much of that island disappears in one tropical storm from rain wind and waves? losing an inch off the top doesn't mean sea levels have risen and if you actually look at the amount they say the sea has risen and the amount of land these islands are loosing, That tiny bit of sea level rise alone is no where near responsible. The thing about climate change is that they are all warning about the future and have been doing that for 30 years. They say \"rising sea levels\" and \"could rise as much as\" but the current numbers they state of actual rise barely registers so how is it constantly responsible for everything including the common cold all of a sudden.", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "Rough And Wretched R.A.W.", "channel": "UCo4O_H9wda710k9DVJxqNFQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT-feFiTgMq4HbVVZFWdQQmZSSkd1o-uigwfKF_vg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Some people say it's only for near land, but they forget that the Dutch have been doing this for hundreds of years. So most of their land is actually below sea level. \n      If you aren't worried about the land being farm able/high in salt, you could speed up the process to within days or months of the walls being completed. \n        \n       China is building islands, although how long those islands will last is another question. (Sand thrown on top of coral reefs) However you could do this to create at least temporary buffers. Allowing the waves to be smaller by losing their energy on those landmasses instead of the main island itself. \n\nGetting engineers and help from other countries espically island cpuntries would be useful as then they'd have people with experience in this. \n       This could include donated materials, ships to transport the materials, builders, and money to fund the construction.  \n         If you end up really desperate for this work, you could talk to china about funding it  in exchange for them gaining some land there for some sort of port or something. As it would allow china to gain more power in that part of the world. However, this is risky as they might just take your island over time and kick you all off. So be wary. \n\n\nWith all this combined, if done right with the right materials, you could complete the project within a year. \n\nUsing that cause way as the foundation for the ocean wall, you might even be able to speed up the project.\n\n\nI'd assume that getting land that doesn't flood is the main priority for their safety. Then preserving land for them that is futile to provide them with food. \n\nTo slow down the erosion of their sea wall, put up concrete jacks in front of it. This forces the wave to break apart before the wall losing a lot of it's energy. \n\nBeyond that there's a lot that can be done, but would require more funding. Like large apartments to help with the overpopulation. Hydro farms to increase the food output. (Would require freshwater unless you get hardy salt resistant plants, like lingenberries. Although that particular plant evolved to live on rocks on a coastline. So putting them on the wall or the jacks would be better for those. \n\nWith all this however, you are likely to lose the traditions and culture of the people living there. As the land would be drastically different in the end. However, I think survival takes precedence over culture. \n\n\n\nThis is just my thoughts on what could be done to help them. I watched the video, I k ow they don't have a lot of funds for this stuff. So again, things would have to be prioritized. Cost saving ideas would have to be used, like using the causeway as the foundation for the wall, and maybe shooting sand over it to build up land on the side that should be dry. Eventually turning the wall, into a coast.

If you visit & look beyond Metropolitan Manila, you'll realize how big the Philippines actually is! The Philippines has 81 provinces with 7,641 islands. There are so much land just waiting to be developed. Yes, it's true that the Philippines is still a developing country but it's economy is growing rapidly. The Philippines is a very livable country and it's actually known for its rich biodiversity. It may not be a rich country by your standards but it has so much potential and natural resources. At least, the Philippines has always been known to be welcoming to refugees like the way it did before when the country opened its doors to the oppressed Jewish people when no other country wanted to take them in. The Philippines also took Vietnamese refugees in Palawan and Bataan. Anyway, I wish the people of Kiribati all the best and I hope all the people in the world will take climate change seriously and take some solid actions to properly address the environmental problems the world is facing right now.

The sea levels DID rise as predicted, but the island has been simultaneously increasing in size & lifting up with this growth. Just bc the Maldives got lucky, it doesn't mean that other visibly submerging islands (emphasis: clearly visible, you only need to watch this video) will have the same growing phenomenon. A report on a University of Auckland study revealed \"it found eight of the atolls and almost three-quarters of the Maldives islands had grown during the study period, lifting Tuvalu's total land area by 2.9 percent – even though sea levels in the country rose at twice the global average.” And just bc climate always changes does not mean we should allow the unique acceleration of that change. When climate has shifted in the past, it was slow enough for communities (like the Dutch and others) to respond quickly enough to combat the issue. But due to human-caused greenhouse gases, we're seeing a level of climate change that has never been observed in such a short span of time. Nothing like this has ever occured in our history at this speed, and to shrug it off bc you prefer apathy, is lazy and just a way for you to justify your complacency.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "YourMajesty143", "channel": "UCNV-z5HXmj4ZRtiDXmPsLyA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRIZY6ykcNQCOkd6OBxP1muK1XBM23u0FV8LQi6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Do u suggest we all live like cavemen to lower carbon emissions.  Temps were a lot hotter in the 30s and that was when carbon emissions were lower.  That obviously means temps have no correlation with carbon dioxide.  Govts have finally figured out another way to scam people and that's through carbon taxes.  Soon they are going to charge you money for breathing.  Mark my words that's coming.  Human populations have risen massively in the last 100 years,  we all produce CO2 to live.  So I guess we'll have to lower the earths population to combat climate change.  I wouldn't put this past them either.

Nowadays, it is possible to melt ice-caps, trigger earthquakes, wake up dormant volcanoes, stir up cyclones, direct hurricanes, send tornadoes to destroy whole townships in 15 minutes, in short, wage weather wars without the civilian victims being able to detect the criminal origin. \nThese covert, hidden plans reveal that the instigators are nothing but cowards, who don't have the nerve to openly declare war on humanity.\nIf we could put the instigators of these weather wars, i.e. climate changers who represent 1% of the world population, in prison where they rightly belong, the winds would drop, the sea would return to its bed, calm would be restored and life for the rest of humanity, the 90% living in poverty until now, would return to normal. \nFor us, the honest 90% who do not have access to the resources used to destroy our hopes, it seems impossible to fight back. \nBut for God nothing is impossible, so prayer in Jesus' name is the first step, then action guided by the Holy Spirit. \nGod bless all the people in Small Island nations, may He visit them and keep them safe and well, and may they entrust their land to God and implore His help before it is too late. \nLord Jesus, when you rebuked the storm on Lake Galilee, your apostles learnt to trust in your mighty Word.

{"cid": "UgxwelZmS0wezXVVUZ14AaABAg", "text": "This is very interesting.  I do believe the climate may be changing.  However, in this film you have also shown other causes for the islands to be sinking.  Sand has a flow, the waves should be washing more sand onto the island to continue to build it up.  Where is the new sand?  You can see the islanders harvesting the coral to build their walls and their homes.  I noticed they are also making cement for building, what is the main ingredient of cement?  Calcium from coral and shells.  They have also over harvested all the sea creatures, which make shells, which also become sand, so sand is being depleted.  The other obvious problem is the coral reefs are dying.  This could be changes in the sea water but it could also be chemicals from all the rubbish scattered across the islands.  These chemicals absolutely kill coral reefs..  Yes, climate change may be the cause of the flooding but I suspect more than 50% of the problem is due to man's influence on the fragile coral environment and also that of healthy sea life.  If the sand isn't being replaced by good coral reefs and crustaceans then you are going to be loosing the sand you already have", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "David Melick", "channel": "UCW82bm65U2684dqg_hv1YEg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLROxcu4ZeIkRHJnZBiXJFtwO8vBBkEPcPTxkg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

These cells can be connected in series to produce 12 - 24 volt outputs. To increase Power, additional panels must be added. So the voltage of solar panels must be \"stepped up\" by transformers which incur considerable losses, when compared with a nuclear steam generator which produces power at 22,000 volts!!\n\n2) Nuclear power stations do not require as much land per megawatt as other low-carbon methods of electricity pro-duction. The Arkansas Nuclear One Station requires only 1,100 acres (1.7 square miles) to produce 1,800 megawatts operating at a 90 percent capacity factor. A study by Entergy Arkansas estimates that for modern wind and solar plants operating at the same capacity, they would require 108,000 acres (169 square miles) and 13,320 acres (21 square miles) of land respectively to produce the same amount of power.   wiki\n\n3) Extensive amounts of copper and or cadmium are required to make enough panels to provide power needs in the USA. Additionally, cadmium has serious health risks. \n\nGo Nuclear!!!!!!!!!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Bill Asbury", "channel": "UC7vfDLdkUugAHy73WqtvHxA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ99Fyj70rO4N1beyQ8CTvvFNjJ7_MUPkQKeydj7A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Climate change occurs in a global cycle of heating and cooling that has even caused ice ages in the past. However, the last 200 years of atmospheric and sea level data shows marked incongruence with the ice core samples taken in the poles, which shows how climate change normally happens and the way that the global warming we are experiencing in these last centuries is happening way too fast with insanely high CO2 levels,\n\nSo no, actually global warming and the corresponding rise in sea levels has not happened this fast in any of the data that science has about the earth's history, and they have a huge amount. \n\nAnd considering the difference between low and high tide, maybe those idiots who think soil erosion explains everything should have a look at the SCIENCE on soil erosion. \n\nSure, the high rate at which sea level are rising (according to worldwide data on sea levels - which means across the ENTIRE GLOBE) has nothing to do with a drowning island where the sea level is...rising.

Countless scientific studies, reviews and organizations make this completely clear and solid. \"It is unequivocal\"--the first three words of the latest U.N. report.  You want to pretend almost 100% of scientists from every credo and country are all corrupt, every one of them politicized in exactly the same way, to all come up with exactly the same scientific results? \nAlso, do you not watch the news, do you not see with your own eyes all the increased wildfires, droughts, floods, melting ice caps, hurricanes and typhoons and monsoons, heat extremes, rising sea levels, coastal inundations? All of these are quantifiable and proven, and available on handy graphs and maps so you can see how it's all getting so much worse. If Kiribati were an isolated case, then fine, maybe it's because stupid politicians destroyed some of the mangrove swamps. But it's the opposite of an isolated case, it is but one of countless examples in a global pattern. Many other places around the world are also submerging, and they're not little-known tiny atolls with small populations. Several of them are coastal cities with very large populations: \"So-called 'delta cities' are already bearing the brunt of rising seas. More than 340 million people live in deltas like Miami, New York City, New Orleans, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Rotterdam, Venice, Dhaka, Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City, and Manila.\" Pretty sure all those mega cities aren't flooding because some politicians cut down some mangroves. \nFor now they're protecting themselves with technology, and some of them can probably keep the water at bay with high-engineering infrastructure, like Rotterdam. But most of them are projected to lose the fight and end up underwater, some within our lifetime--especially since climate deniers such as yourself fabricate all kinds of fallacious and false pretexts to keep belching greenhouse gases into the atmosphere--the very atmosphere that keeps life on Earth alive.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Michelle Sheaff", "channel": "UCsl45rZHLVXtSwo7BdGz3gw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQuI7oOXi8RFC56FfiPrCsQUmZgV-GDvEy_Cg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwKIWbiRdMDxaNbzC94AaABAg", "text": "The sad reality that must be faced by all and that we cannot stop is that these beautiful places are sinking into the rising sea levels. So, the practical, logical thing to do is to stop bringing in so many immigrants from certain other countries but put the people from these sinking Pacific Islands on boats and move them to big dry but still solid land masses, like Australia. They are going to hate being on such a vast dry, barrrn environment like Australia, that is also very cold in the south and fire prone to the east. Compared with the paradise environments they come from, with no water shortage, lush greenery etc. But, at least they won't sinking into the sea. Best places to settle these islanders would be in the warmer, lusher tropical areas of Australia, to the north eg parts of Queensland that has lush tropical forests, tropical fruits etc are are by the sea, as these island people are very much sea people who fish etc to eat. They could work well in such industries in Australia and fit in, adapt OK. Putting them incities or on outback remote vast cattle stations or farming in temperate southen areas or mining in Western Australia in blazing 50 Centigrade heat and little water would kill them off in no time. The best way to help migrants settle into a new land and retain their sanity after so musch stress and upheaval in their lives is to put them into an area that is as close as possible to the sort of environment and what they did in their old land. Eg if they were sea and fishing people, put them near the sea, doing jobs like fishing etc. If they were agricultural types, like farmers, settle them on farming areas. If they were herders from hot dry places eg Middle Eastern people, send them outback to capture snd herd all the wild camels out there, causing havoc, breeding prolifically. These middle Eastern people would be very expert at dealing with camels and useful export and other industries could be set up culling these camel plagues eg capture our nice big fat healthy young camels and export them to the Middle East. Or breed pedigree white \"show camels\" for their novelty value, to sell to the very affluent types who like these as a status symbol, like we value a Rolls Royce to get around in for some special occasion eg a bride's wedding day transport or for other big celebration calling for great pomp and splendour that some cultures have.Asian people seem to be perfectly at ease in highly congested, polluted, noisy etc  large cities in Asia, be as are many Indians.

In fact, 17 of the 18 warmest years on record have all taken place since 2001.  \n\nThis much faster warming corresponds with levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which have been increasing since the industrial revolution. So, when people talk about climate change today, they mean anthropogenic (man-made) climate change. This is the warming of Earth’s average temperature as a result of human activity, such as burning coal, oil and gas to produce energy to fuel our homes and transport and cutting down trees to produce the food we eat.\n\nGlobal warming is causing the Earth’s average surface temperature to increase. This is not only making heatwaves and droughts more likely but it’s also causing changes to our natural climate systems. These changes are making extreme weather events more likely and more severe. For example, hurricanes and storms are becoming more intense, moving slower and taking longer to die down.  \n\nBecause of where we are, the UK & Ireland are likely to get more rain and wind as a result of climate change while New York will see more snow.\n\nIt's a commonly-held belief that renewable energy is expensive, but this simply isn’t true! Solar power and onshore wind are the cheapest ways of generating electricity; meaning the energy they produce is cheaper than using nuclear, gas and fossil fuels.  \n\nThe cost of renewables has fallen faster than anyone could have predicted. And yet the government are still backing dirty fossil fuels. Did you know the UK has the biggest fossil fuel subsidies in the EU? That’s right, they spend an eye-watering €12bn (£10.5bn) a year supporting dirty fossil fuels.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "D A", "channel": "UCT0PILMeF2feJZsNhQ_U4-A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS7c6VoCAN_92S46Yi5YZBQMOKbyEI5Cyw3xA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As time is now proving that this island may be in trouble because of its sand based footprint ,  it does NOT mean it will not be here for the next thousand years because NO ONE KNOWS . To think that anyone can prevent mother nature from taking this island is stupidity beyond belief.....Mankind is based on greed  and financial return ,  so to find the money to save this island would be astronomical and the returns would not justify those costs. How naive to think that mankind could ever beat mother nature anyway, and how stupid to think that coral stacked up against a low level wall can somehow  save the island from the sea when the REAL issue is the BASE of the island that is the real problem.

You guys are islanders just like us, and we need to stick together. Beside the Pacific Islander culture and Eastern Indonesian are identic.\n\nIdk if you guys will be happy or not moving to overseas. Speaking of migrating, while you guys still thinking about it, and wanting to stay longer in Kiribati, maybe these tips could help:\n1. Plant more mangroves to prevent the abrasion alongshore to defend the land from eroding, instead of building a sea wall coz it just wasting time. Beside you'll kill the fish's house. Coz Fish lives in the reefs or corals. So, by destroying them you'll lose the fish gradually. By the way, if the coral or reef become bigger, they could catch sand or any solid material, so by letting them grow, you could gain more island or more area in the future I think.\n\n2. DO NOT over-extracting your ground water (if you guys have) coz it leads to the land sinking like what my capital Jakarta is having now.\n\n3. The desalination plant is a good short term program to solve the fresh water crisis, but if it possible, do more environmental engineering.\n\n4. Do Planting more various types of plants in the bigger mass area. You guys could try Banyan tree that is believed could gather the ground water. Or many more types of staple food plants.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Saiful Harlindong", "channel": "UCZWSDcK_EKZJ8tSjx33PPZw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRE27UlQOj6u7IIeNN2aPkeIY1d67oRoExHdLSwYg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugxgmcm5QDLCO8Ee0wR4AaABAg", "text": "I see people all the way around the equator exploiting their natural habitats in order to get money. The natives don't need this dependency on money but they think they do. We must introduce a complete guide to independent and green living on Kiribati and everywhere in the world. When you live on Kiribati for example what the environmentalists are already doing when they are planting Mangrows they are helping the eco system to adapt to the rising ocean levels and this is already a fantastic step to make. I am very grateful that they are doing that. All natives need to plant Mangrows along the coast. Another step is to Not breed animals and Not slaughter animals anymore. The natives and every human can live fully whole food vegan. Whole plant food is the best for our health. People must question their old traditions and habits or any type of exploitation for money. Don't cook plants and don't cook palm sugar water. Don't even engage into a trade market of any kind. Stay at home with your precious resources and keep the resources whole. Eat the plants and drink the juices fresh every day. Trade work locally and trade plants locally. Another very important step is to do composting of all biodegradable materials including animal dung and human dung this is vitally important for the planet and our our health and must be implemented everywhere on the planet. We need to bring decomposed biomass material back into the eco system and the soil for healthy plants to grow and for our own nutrition. In the western world they have been taking nutrients away from the soil now for over 100 years. Rudolf Steiner warned us about the soil depletion but nobody listened to him. Now the food they grow is empty of nutrients. What we take we have to put back into the land. People need to learn to use bucket toilets which work very well and they are very clean with compost and plant clippings that fall off as a side product from trimming hedges, mowing lawns, cutting food plants etc. It is helpful to get mulch processing tools that create an easy to work with pulp or finely shredded plant material for use in the toilet buckets and also for cleaning the seats and buckets with mulch and ocean water this works very well No soap is even necessary. There are some plants that have natural saponins (which are soap elements) in them which also grow in tropical regions and which work the best fresh for washing hair and body for animals and humans. Solar energy can be stored in batteries fed with solar roofs to create self sustainable electricity for garden tools and computers etc. The toilet buckets can always be emptied into large compost areas designated for decomposing biomass materials. We use large trash containers which hold like 40 gallons of biomass. We drilled holes into the bottom for scavenger insects to get into it and worms. We also drilled some holes on the side and also into the lid for rainwater to get in so that the biomass stays hydrated for the worms and insects. The scavenger insects will decompose the dung compost quickly within just a few weeks into fertile Earth soil which then can be emptied into an open area from where it can be utilized for planting food plants again. You can create a completely sustainable system where money is not even necessary anymore. You can create your own paradise.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Clay And Putty Videos", "channel": "UCIjFeeW1ZuVi39GJwLE71lQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQc5lImq-cCS8UlrAB-MUQrc-UVmrsgAFbCD8tmIQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yet many seem to ignore the consequences of extreme urbanization and land expansion into the sea along coastal cities.\r \n(1) Urban communities that have paved roads, drainage and expansion covering all its environment make it difficult for the land to soak and trap rain water. Thus, almost all the rain water flood into the creeks, rivers overflowing into swamps, lakes, spilling more than its normal volume of water into the sea. When that happens, mud and debris end up along the river banks and lakes forcing water further out towards the other end.\r\n(2) When a large swampy land or an area that contains a body of water is being filled with hard rocks and soil to create land space, the amount of water in that area is being pushed out causing a rise in the sea level in flat coastlines.\r\nWe don't necessarily need a scientific research to verify that. Any average person can understand this natural law of cause and effect.\r\nAffluent industrialized cities should stop the expansion of land along the seashores.

If the government can allow for heavy investment in resorts, it may afford to pay for the Engineering works needed to salvage the sinking islands/atolls.

There is enough sand and coral in that sea to help them raise the levels of the whole island by at least 3-4 metres. The world can help them. Heavy precast concrete barriers/reefs followed by sand-filling, demolition of the houses and building them on the new higher ground, and finally, placing sea level monitoring systems both near and deeper in the sea for early warning, Island sinking monitoring systems etc can be done to save the Paradise even as we struggle to make hydrogen and oxygen replace hydrocarbon fuels.

Sadly most Americans & many Europeans aren't up to the task. They don't understand how they harm.

I was flabbergasted!\n\nAbout parts of the US being collectivist, your views seem biased. I'm shocked at the ignorance, about something everyone can see. I've lived in many many parts of the US, both the deep south, the \"interior\" (mid-west), both coasts, rural and city. All of America is individualistic (it's baked into our \"gold medal winner\" culture; it's why we do little to help places like Kiribati, battling global warming).\n\nBeing \"helpful\" or \"having unity\" is NOT what collectivism entails. All over the south, people try to force their views and expectations onto everyone (e.g. about family planning/abort*on onto others). The selfishness in the south and interior are now causing them to die in droves from COVID (\"_I will do what I want about masks_\").

Trash being thrown away irresponsibly near the coral reefs has killed the protective reefs that restricted the attack of the island by the sea & the constant harvesting of mangrove trees took away the soil by leaving no strong ground structure to keep soil and other plants in place. The rising population is obviously a huge problem since even with no loss of land there would be a decreasing lifestyle as it gets more and more into sardine can living conditions. I pray these people reduce their family size so it maintains the traditional population of the island  & they find ways to restore the areas where waste has affected the reefs , and plants can have a better chance of holding the island together by planting mangroves and placing other plant species between them .

It's something called... wait for it... wait for it... CO2 genius. CO2 feeds the plants and trees on the planet. If you cut back your CO2 emissions, you are CHOKING the planet, and not feeding trees and plants is how they die off, and when they die off, the soil dies and then erodes. Let me guess, you probably believe in the whole renewable energy scam, too? lol   Do some research dude, those windmills are killing MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of bats and large bird species. And they are horribly inefficient and they take alot of energy to make them, they only operate between 15-30 percent of the time, and need FOSSIL fuel energy when they are not operating and they have a lifespan of what, 20 years maybe, before they what? Get piled up in landfills? Most of them are heavily subsidized by Government, so you are paying way more for them, because they get your energy bill, and then they take more in taxes from you to pay for the subsidies. Shall we talk about all of the toxic waste that results from making and then later having to dispose of wind and solar? And China is using child labor to mine the toxic materials they use to make their cheap solar panels and their wind turbines. And yeah, the Chinese cut corners and make cheap solar panels, so they'll end up in the land fills poisoning our environment soon. China cuts corners on everything it does. Dude, I could go on for hours talking about all the ways you and your climate change nutjobs calling for immediate action are all wrong, wrong and VERY wrong. You want to help the environment, keep driving your fossil fueled vehicles, plant some trees and plant some plants, too, and do it the right way, research it first so that you get the right type of plants or trees for your area, and plant them the right way, so that they help the ground retain biomass and absorb the rain when it falls, etc..", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jason Matthews", "channel": "UC129uDSXt9ky5w6cktv-wZA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSec1Cj5yYIyVfbOZaPcO7rpDdpS8eKamWYloz5=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxxVh5TiMzSOVLm4nl4AaABAg", "text": "It is a misconception that the ocean level is rising. It hasn't changed, regardless of graphs. If levels are \"rising\" at Puerto Ric's beaches, then they would be rising around the world. They aren't. They are at the same level they have been for the last 40 years (I live on the coast and it would be seen). Like the Cliffs of Dover and the Northern European WW2 shore gunnery embankments falling into the sea, erosion of soft soil by way of tidal action is responsible for loss of beaches. Since the advent of extremely accurate digital measuring devices in the early '90s, it is proven that sea levels have not risen since '93, in direct contradiction to environmentalists' claims. If you put a large chunk of ice in a bucket of water and let it melts, the water level in the bucket doesn't change. So, the issue isn't global warming. The climate has been changing second to second since the birth of Earth's atmosphere, 4.5B years ago. The climate changes from warm to cold and back again like a pendulum, and will continue to do so, long after humanity is gone. As an example, both poles have been either temperate or tropical forests, a hundred times over, each forestation episode lasting from 1,000 to 100,000 years and then back to ice. Proof is in the fossil record from ground corings (ferns and palms in both poles). This occurs on average, every 20M to 25M years, through a combination of planetary and solar conditions. People should never build in a flood plain or tidal zone. That is courting disaster. For the apparent rise in water levels here, this island is located, like many others, on active tectonic fault lines. Plates rise and sink. This one is sinking. We have been in a warming period for the last 5,000 years, since the area around the pyramids was much more green then, than it is today. For the poles to be forested, the average planetary temperature would normally be 20'Centigrade warmer than it is today. The primate evolutionary tree wasn't even around during the last forestation period, so how is it that \"scientists\" who should know alot better, claim that we are responsible? Is the planet warming? Yes. Is it a normal and regular occurance? Yes. Will it get cold again? Yes. It's the pendulum effect. It happens in an active, living atmosphere with interactive global macro weather patterns. Think for yourselves and don't jump onto the politicized and hysterics laden environment bandwagon (someone is making alot of money off peoples' ignorance and hysteria).", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "doctorno0070", "channel": "UC65MzaF1E4boJMRmhOtxO1w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSp-Xs3HEGKz6mT4JZyIo4gWvZLISGJzm1TZfDtug=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Back in the 60`s Niwa or it`s equal , set up weather gathering stations all over the planet , over time every station`s records were interfered with or manipulated , that is all except Russia`s , theirs was the only one that gave the true and correct readings of many decades .

The oceans of the world are rising 2.1mm per year which may not be noticeable as you constantly and unconsciously adjust to seeing the sea levels in your area. Living by the sea I notice the change in my local area in Australia over 60 years. But this rise isn't a constant because as warming continues this will accelerate. The above hocus pocus about tectonics from the yokels who don't understand science misses the fact that it takes hundreds of thousands of years to affect change by plate movement. Earthquakes and localised movement CAN affect sea levels in areas. It's a factor in SAMOA but not in other areas. All scientific journals across the world agree on the warming of the planet, the melting of arctic and antarctic ice. This is CONSTANTLY MEASURED.. it's an awfully big conspiracy brain fart to think that such large numbers of scientists who are working in this field EVERY DAY would fake something so wide ranging. It shows a misunderstanding of science and a probably a lack of basic education thanks to right wing commodifying of education. We all have the right to education. However you tube videos are not where you should be learning anything other than how to change the ram in your computer or how to play \"Stairway to Heaven\" on the guitar.

Worldwide, an annual increase in sea level of 3 mm has been measured. Melting water and sea temperature rise contribute about as much to sea level rise.\r\nThere are several factors that can also increase sea level, but they have a greater local impact.\r\nFresh water occupies a larger volume than salt water. In places where the sea receives increased fresh water content, this could lead to higher sea levels locally.\r\nIf climate change changes ocean currents, it also matters. A new distribution of hot and cold water will change the sea level locally in the places affected by this.\r\nThe sea is not flat, although it may look like this. It is due to the gravitational force. Mass attracts mass also horizontally. The greater the mass, the greater the attraction. Large land masses attract more water than smaller land masses do.\r\n\rThis means that there will be consequences for the sea level locally if large ice masses on the mainland melt away. For example, when the ice over Greenland is reduced, it reduces the gravitational force so that Greenland gets less attraction on the surrounding water. The meltwater will therefore not flood the Greenland coastline. On the contrary. The sea level around Greenland may fall, Greenland's land masses will rise, even what today is under water will rise above, due to the heaviness of today's ice masses melting, and then the oceans of the world will rise, and have already startet!", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Atgeir Nyttingnes", "channel": "UCTNJZh-wHwZfRULCPaXBhJg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSUNrWL6YHbZhYd42zMw2tVyV5Olyvd21ajVgForBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

To your point, yes, are living in an interglacial period which follows a natural progression of warming and cooling. However, without the impact of human industry (and other high-carbon activities), we would likely barely notice Earth processes (like sea-level rise) because the impact would be so minimal. Of course, there have always been storms, and will always be storms, but human activity has been proven time and time again to have a dramatic affect on the natural world. With that said, I think a lot of people have trouble grasping this concept because it seems impossible for our daily choices to have such a large impact. That is partly true.. with a few major caveats... I will always advocate strongly for more environmentally conscious choices, but individual carbon footprints are not most prominent producer of climate change--for that, we look to industry. This is why we need to encourage our government to prioritize climate change--this is undoubtably the biggest threat to the human population.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "april waves", "channel": "UCf0JVT96CcnjwOUAVjVAO6A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSQ1CEHnwPdtwnGKy4a6jgsG53LUOEJAtu-7w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Pacific Coral Atolls are extinct oceanic volcanoes which formed above Mantle plumes. The plumes are effectively stationary and the oceanic plate moves over the top of them. This is why chains of islands are formed. The plume pushes the oceanic crust upwards and a volcano develops. With plate movement  the volcano is moved physically away from the plume which makes the volcano extinct and the sea begins to erode it. At the same time because the oceanic crust of which it is part cools, the eroding\nvolcano sinks. Corals seed themselves on the eroding volcano and grow up towards the light.  It then becomes a race between the coral growing and the atoll sinking. In the end the atoll wins and sink below the waves, eventually become a guyot. The cause is thermal subsidence and nothing whatsoever to do with  changes in sea level due to climate change, its basic erosion .", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Dixi Normous", "channel": "UCIrlg3pPsGDz0dAAqqr1ZzQ", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8R453vDGzIb0yQItxtqzwZ7rY14xLP0u6eb8ALg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw_M76V63AvhHWBHfF4AaABAg.8zmhj9oTwL-92Alush2_D4", "text": " @Joseph W  Climate change is an umbrella-term for the several processes and phenomenon of changes in the planet's global weather averages, including erosion, ocean acidification, rising sea level, heavier and unsustainable rainfall, longer droughts, glaciation and last but not least the rise of global averages of temperature, and many more.\n\nMany of the major geographic processes are indeed human-aided, as a result of humans' tremendous ability to affect our environment. Agriculture is literally the changing and domestication of animals and plants and land to suit the needs of food and water security. Why can't climate change be in some manner, caused or at least accelerated by human action?\n\nAnd I would agree with you, that climate change is not the fault of individuals like you or I or anyone else's direct actions.\nRather, and this has been the case for many years, that it is the fault of entrenched institutions and large corporate businesses maintaining a status quo that benefits them and stockholders in the short-term but fails to conserve the human environment.\n\nSo, please, don't go around straight up calling ideas or well-documented geographic processes lies b/c they don't fit a narrative? \n\nAs for whether or not it was intelligent of the people to settle on a island, well that's kind of a self-centered and unnuanced way to look at it. Those islands are some persons' homes, with families and past childhoods, so it seems very disrespectful and unbecoming to just denigrate some person's ancestors just b/c they settled somewhere that may not be there hundreds to thousands of years later.\nI suppose a good analogy, would be a cattle ranching family has had an estate with good grazing and open spaces to their family for generations only to be wiped away from a flash flood, just because the ranch was settled on a flood plain. \n\nFurthermore, in the wake of seemingly obstinate industrial countries unwilling to change their policies, pacific islands and small nation-states are forced to double down on adapting to a sadly inevitable force of rapid change. These countries are struggling to adapt to overcome these challenges. The most effective action we can do may be pushing our industrial governments to take action.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Mark", "channel": "UC6HMz9gSwsA5qSzYMBF7x-g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSxD4L7Kvk7iRU2_kw89lxVI0EB81-z_WuDkg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The North American plate, for instance, had a great big sea in the middle of it, which has made for a lot of nice and otherwise irretrievable marine fossil discoveries.\n\n\nWhat also helped is that back in the glory days of the Megalodon, global temperatures were higher, which melted the ice caps and raised sea levels quite a bit. It was only after the waters started cooling that the cold-blooded sharks that we love went extinct.\n\n\nThe continents may have shifted, but we can still see part of this play out as current events unfold. With temperatures rising, the ice caps are melting and the oceans are expanding due to their rise in temperatures (the hotter something is, the more space it takes up, and with something as gargantuan as the ocean, it adds up, if only in feet and inches).\n\n\nThe issue now though is that we're making that change happen way faster than normal. Something that normally takes thousands of years (such as the glacial retreat, melt, and sea level rise of the last ice age) now is being done in decades.

Simple science. Water expands when it increases in temperature.

They, too, are adding to pollution with vehicles and plastics, etc. Plates move, rise, and sink, as do islands and atolls with them. They always have and they always will. Ocean currents and the seas change, they always have and they always will. With their high population growth, they demand more and more resources to survive, more land to live on, and they have dessicated many of the mangrove groves on their atoll of which the roots helped slow the erosion leading to the atoll being eaten away by the sea at a faster pace. They are removing large amounts of coral around the atoll which would house fish and that affects their food sources. It is much easier to have someone, anyone, else to place sole blame on for these issues than it is to accept that things are much as they have always been, all things will eventually pass away, and that they themselves have also contributed to their predicament.

It is now with the age of instant communication and the narrative of the left that we are made to feel guilty with things that happen normally? This is more propaganda than actual information. I do feel for the people but building a home on the middle of the ocean is hardly what I would call a \"logical\" decision.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Frank Dijker", "channel": "UCthwhG_DVf0VO8Te4bXP80w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR81_UR0Gn6CQd23bvZrH5KWDfqd1WFmLhn-A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If we didn’t exist on this earth, the global warming and climate change would still happen. Most likely at a different, slower, rate. We may have accelerated the issue for sure, but it really isn’t possible to accurately determine how much faster. The thing that gets smaller mention, but is likely the largest issue is the ocean currents have changed in this area. This creates more erosion and also has created the heavier seas. This is something that could have happened regardless of global warming. Ocean currents are constantly changing.  \n    With all this said I cannot think of an answer. I am sure the mangrove planting will help save, and even restore the islands to a degree. They need water ABOVE their roots to survive though so there is an equilibrium point that may or may not work. Gotta try though. Eventually the growth will become so thick that it will be hard to access the ocean through the mangroves. There is always a trade off. \n     I do wish the people the best of health and luck. It is a touchy subject, but, maybe have smaller families with 1 or 2 children for a few decades to slow the increasing demand  for more land when the land is disappearing. This should be starkly obvious to the least educated there even. The government could communicate the fact that the country has less and less land for the people to live on. The population can not afford to double in the next 20 years. Probably not even the next 100 years unless ocean currents change again. Who knows? Just stop making these ridiculous suggestions without any actual thought before making them. You think you are being smart but you really look stupid saying them. \n  If the experts have no answers, and their job is to spend all day, every work day, to come up with realistic and affordable answers, what makes you think a suggestion with only a moments thought will be the answer?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "67 C10", "channel": "UCsTiDVYXVLuRwPi5AmSukfw", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTR8auhdRDLNRhXg968KAtbZ_gua-w1UgoFwwji=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Your attitude is equivalent to someone saying \"Forest fires are great, bc they provide us with heat and ash\". Use common sense, one positive outcome does not cancel out other negative impacts. According to the survey you mentioned: While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events. The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may also be LIMITED, said co-author Dr. Philippe Ciais, associate director of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, Gif-suv-Yvette, France. “Studies have shown that plants acclimatize, or adjust, to rising carbon dioxide concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.”", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "YourMajesty143", "channel": "UCNV-z5HXmj4ZRtiDXmPsLyA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRIZY6ykcNQCOkd6OBxP1muK1XBM23u0FV8LQi6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The amount of taxes you pay to subsidize the environmental costs of the fossil fuel industries and meat industries are in the hundreds of dollars annually, whereas environmental taxes are typically pennies on the dollar. Even with an increase in carbon taxes, it would STILL be cheaper on your pocket, than to continue the current system that \"pick-pockets\" your wallet. Man, they've got you brainwashed good. The best defense these industries have are folks who are scientifically-ignorant and emotionally-biased. \n\nFYI I'm non-partisan, I can't stand either the Dems or the GOP. But one thing's for sure is that climate awareness is NOT a political issue, it's a socioeconomic problem that affects all sides. Btw the taxes that would support environmental programs aren't just for climate change, they're for cleaner air, cleaner water, prevention of land desertification & soil erosion, protection of endangered species proper disposal of trash, proper nuclear waste disposal, proper regulation of industry waste like farm manure, proper inspections of ecohazardous industries, prevention of trespassing on Native reservations for exploitative fracking, better defense systems against wildfires, floods, hurricanes, etc. \n\n^ALL of these things (and others that I haven't mentioned) have been greatly underfunded for the past 2 terms. You can't be stupid enough to tell me that you're ok with manure running off into your drinking water, or a nuclear plant storing radioactive material in your neighboring town, or the your city not having clean air regulations.

There has been global warming since the little ice age, a VERY constant and slow warming from a record low point that climate alarmist scam artists likes to use as the starting point for their pseudo-scientific graphs, conveniently doing away with the Much warmer period prior, with Much higher CO2, while showing ZERO correlation between CO2 and warming. \n\nYOU are the narrow-minded easily fooled populist moron that absolutely DID NOT look at the science or listen to the ACTUAL climate specialists at all, but mindlessly regurgitate the political propaganda used by TV hosts and mass media. I SERIOUSLY doubt that you have done your due diligence in looking at the actual studies, actual data or the judgement of people specializing in quality assessment of the scientific integrity and methodology, like Tony Heller. \n\nThere is absolutely ZERO support for the claim that CO2 has ANY effect on temperature. what we DO now for a FACT is that CO2 makes plants grow faster, which we now KNOW for a FACT has RAPIDLY increased the amount of greening on this planet, and that this greening helps stabilize temperature and extreme weather, even though there has been ZERO increase in extreme weather events at all, but rather a measurable constant decline.  \n\nLiterally every single thing in Al Gores propaganda piece of shit fearmongering film claimed and predicted has been proven WRONG, just like every single other alarmist claim by \"scientists\" (LOL) has made in the last 200 years. Michael Manns infamous hockey-stick graph has been thoroughly debunked and proven to generate the same horrific predictions no matter what data you feed it. \n\nIs there in fact ANY claim by climate alarmist morons that you can stand behind and not have debunked by any remotely rational critical thinker hare? Just one. facts and sources needed to support your positive claim. i won't hold my breath though.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Calys Agora", "channel": "UCZ8VHjnuKFOrTG-q-xi9U3g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQT5-k4H33iIW8M4qJtEspEYLZX69VhvIttws5J=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's been constantly getting dryer as plant-life dissappears witch consequently traps ever less dew and trigger ever less rain as a result in a vicious cycle and a downwards spiral,  which started with the Moors ruling the area and starting to  channeling water from nature into irrigation, drying up nature as a result.\n\nThen the Romans took over and copied the Moors technology but added compulsive tilling and large infestation-prone monocrops plus large hurds of grazing goats who kept eating all young treelings which add salt to the cutting down of all hardwood to build warships and cooking firewood for an ever growing population. \n\nThis was a tradition the Spainish kingdom followed by cutting down more trees for building the Spanish Armada. (This is also why we have almost no oak, book or ash forests left in Sweden where I come from)  Nature stopped recover here from the ever more often human created  forest fires, leading to this mountainous area having eroded due to the ever rarer and more intense flash floods generating what was previously fertile thick top soil to a clay soil with no organic content  and sand in the best case, but naked rock for the most part. \n\nTHIS is man-made LOCAL climate change, and relatively informed individials keep assuming this once sub-tropic forrest was created by \"Climate change\" and most people have no clue it ever was any different than in the classic Hollywood studio Spaghetti Westerns famously recorded around here. Dusty, dry and mostly inert.\n\nWe live here and are loosing the last water in the last oasis to corporate high-intensity olive plantations irrigating millions of trees with hundreds of liters per tree pee day. We keep planting trees, and we got the nearby mountain top removal gypsum mine stopping it's operations as our house foundations cracked from their explosions. \n\nTHIS is real, observable, undeniable large-scale human  habitat destruction, with very simple tangiable solutions that we need that is being ignored and blamed on this simple minded ignorant climate change garbage nonsense.\n\nIt drives me nuts listening to those uninformed collectivist critters that can't differentiate between a falsifiable theory and an unfalsifiable hypothesis, and thinks that fortune-tellers and consensus has anything to do with science, truth or reality.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Calys Agora", "channel": "UCZ8VHjnuKFOrTG-q-xi9U3g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQT5-k4H33iIW8M4qJtEspEYLZX69VhvIttws5J=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They are very low, about 3 meters above the average sea level. I have heard first hand accounts of people seeing other people being swept away by typhoons, because the giant waves washed over their atoll. People tied themselves to palm trees, but some were lost to the sea, even so. I have even sailed through a typhoon, and I consider myself lucky to have survived the experience.\n\nI sailed my own little 10 meter sailboat to many places, including Fiji and Kiribati, on a long voyage from Seattle to Hong Kong, via the South Pacific, and I am a scientist, the chief scientist for a biotech company.

I was staying in a motel in the USA and a lady who cleaned the rooms I asked about her accent.  She said she was from south sea island that flooded with climate change and all had to move.  She ended up in Guam.  She married a US airforce soldier stationed in Guam.  He was head of maintenance in the motel.  I wonder if she was from Kiribati.  So sad many in the world today, millions more each year, are refugees from, NAFTA, wars fueled by the US aiding or selling weapons to, climate change, over population... and try to come to America.  They are only doing what anyone trying to survive would do.  Really I feel that most refugees would agree that their real wish would be to remain in their original culture and homeland, like the Central Americans and Mexicans, or the Rohinga (sp?) or those from Syria, or Africa, or Southeast Asia, anywhere, Kiribati...  Identity with culture, place, religion, language, all is very important and so sad many like here in the USA don't see that with the refugees of the world.  I saved a young man, only 19, from jumping off a bridge in my city in the USA.  He was from Somalia.  This doc is very important showing how a sense of place and culture is so important, a universal to the human condition.  I think of all the billionaires and how just a small desalination plant would help so many.

You are just plain wrong and have no idea what us Pacific Islanders in low lying atolls have to go through. It's true that many island civilizations started because of voyages across the ocean, but this isn't Moana. This is the 21st century, and you can't just move entire populations to another country.  Being a climate refugee isn't just as solvable and as simple as \"migrating as our ancestors did.\" Immigration is so strict in so many countries. In the case of moving to America, because America has a lot of interdependence in Micronesia, President Trump barely respects war refugees seeking alyssum. There's a 0% chance of him and his stance on climate change being a hoax to bat an eye at us climate refugees. Few of us like myself are lucky enough to be able to move to the states, or to another 1st world country, even if it means living in conditions anywhere from lower-middle-class to poverty, mind you in a place that discriminates against you, like how many Micronesians (including, Kirbatians, Marshallese, Chuukese, Pompeians, and so many more) live in Hawaii and get people saying we should be eradicated because locals don't like us. A lot of people on the islands are poorly educated and live in extreme poverty and bad health because of the lack of funding in medical care and schooling. They are not suited for the environment of just uprooting their whole family and moving them to a different country where they can barely speak the language. We know that nothing stays the same, we know that things are always changing, it's just that our islands have to pay the price for unethical environmental decisions from larger countries for the sake of that affects us. It doesn't affect the people who mad these decisions out of greed, it affects us. Natural changes and natural variability in the climate are not as drastic. The difference of this man-made climate change that you find so misleading is that the things we are doing to our earth by disrupting the natural carbon cycle with exhausting all our resources and releases unprecedented amounts of carbon emissions. Anyway, since you seem so knowledgable in the migrations of my people, do tell me, where do you suggest these thousands of people worth of population should move to, just since you brought it up 🤷🏽", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Seona Chutaro", "channel": "UC_THATci9ZFDAGTFIm2dlEA", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/EnSR-4LqLTQevNog_sssmMz8lBwKId5cwW9Qyt938N-eQa307D5chvgbmQwzEFtluVr2ESHnbA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxMxGHlJ90wPl1i9eB4AaABAg", "text": "I’m saddened and sickened by the attitude of so many of the comments on here. The eagerness to blame the Gilbertese people for their plight speaks to a callous indifference, an ill will even, which I feel is horrifying. The casual dismissal of any Western responsibility, for the clearly visible effects that AGW is wreaking, bodes badly for world cooperation to mitigate its effects. The attitudes displayed by so many here will lead us to war, instead.\n\nSome salient points:\n1.     There is an almost universal consensus amongst the world’s scientific community that our climate is changing at an extremely rapid pace, and that this is being driven, to a very large extent, by human created pollution.The only dissenting scientific voices seem to be those employed in the petrochemical industry which, of course, has huge resources for publicising this dissent.\n2.      On a per capita basis, a number of the middle eastern oil producers are the highest polluters, but Australia, USA and Canada come in at # 11, 12 and 14 respectively, with around 15 tons of carbon emissions per head per year. The average for the whole world is 4.9 tons.\n3.      The EU, as a whole is at #49 and 8.6 tons.\n4.       China is #55 at 7.2 tons, but it is important to note that much of this pollution is created producing goods for consumption by other people.\n5.       Kiribati is #183 and produces just 0.6tons per head per year.\n\nWe, none of us, get to chose where we are born. Nor do we get a choice over where we spend our formative years. And for the vast majority of those living in places like Kiribati finding a place to move to is not a simple task. \nSome compassion and humility would be in order.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Q.

By doing this we would be cleaning up and recycling plastics and styrofoam to a place where it can actually be reused again for something needed and not thrown away. Since it looks like we are not addressing floating trash problems in both oceans, it should not be to hard to find financial sponsorship for a new project which will serve 2 purposes or more at the same time.

Which if you don't know, peer reviewed means these studies are analyzed and scrutinized by other scientists whose goal is to try to find flaws and cracks in the study, in order to make sure the data is accurate and the study overall stands up to the scientific method so if it is peer reviewed the average person who knows nothing of science can actual trust the findings. Which also means that when that sliver of studies that goes against the consensus fails to be peer reviewed, that kills their credibility. \nYou then call people who support science \"religious\"... Okay, just because you fail to grasp that systematic observation, analysis, and experimentation (which is the core of what science is) is the literal opposite of a \"religious belief\" does not make your opinion true.

I would just like to say: \n1. Could you deniers just for a second appreciate the obvious fact, that if you thought Anthropogenic Global Warming was real you would regard it as an important event? Might not disparate stories become interesting solely because of their connection to this epochal event playing out in real time? \n2. The idea that global warming isn't happening, or isn't causing the climate change we are seeing, or that it's a natural/cyclical event is the result of fossil-fuel interests muddying the waters to protect their profits. The only reason it picked up traction in the U.S.A. is that denial of global warming was turned into a statement of political allegiance, and hence not open to rational debate.

This has nothing to do with seas rising / climate change garbage. If we keep saying it, climate change, climate change, climate change, then people start believing the lie. STOP listening to delusional people that are always coming up with the next \"Sky Is Falling\" story. A few decades ago, it was Acid Rain will destroy all forests. What happened to that? Then it was Global Cooling which morphed into Global Warming which has now become Climate Change and the Seas Are Rising. So dumb. Here is your proof. 40 years ago as a boy, I made a mark on my grandfather's pier going into the water at sea level. Last year when I visited, at high tide the water is still at that same level 40 years later. How then are the seas rising? The dock should be under water. It is not. According to the National Park Service, the all time record highest air temperature of 134°F (57°C) was recorded at Death Valley on July 10, 1913. That was over 100 years ago. If the earth is warming up, this record would have been broken multiple times in the last 100+ years but it has not. Temperatures are stable, not increasing. They always show pictures of ice melting in the Arctic Circle during the summer months but why don't they show the ice forming in the Arctic Circle in the winter months? Let's face it. There is an agenda. The powers that rule need the hocus pocus Climate Change story for some reason. The Seas Are Rising lie is the same as the Sky Is Falling lie. Somebody is making a lot of money off of scaring the masses. Eventually it may be forced down our throats with a so called lying Carbon Tax - just another way to tax you (take your hard earned money to give it to people who are already rich and want more power). The rich elite on this earth who have power and control also need the masses (called The Mob in Roman Empire times) to obey them and not revolt against them so they can stay in power. They always sew fear into the media because it is a form of control. The rich elite who rule had to figure out how to control the masses (The Mob) and this is one of the ways they do it. Fear of something. Whether real or not is irrelevant and in this case, they choose the weather. Quit being a cow because that is all they see us as - cattle! We are livestock to them. If a few thousand die, so what. They don't care about you or me. When are you going to become smarter and stop listening to the lies that constantly come from your TV? Seeing is believing right?

If you're sick of hearing about climate change - and I am, too - then you should be doing everything in your power to mitigate it's effects. It's already too late for us to stop it. We should have started mitigating the damage decades ago. We're already seeing increased natural disasters as a result of man-made climate change, and those are only going to become more prevalent. We're going to see massive changes in our lifetime (we've already started seeing them), and complete societies are going to become displaced, meaning more refugees will become dependent on wealthier, better situated societies. It's too late to stop it, but we can try to slow it down, or mitigate its effects. The alternative doesn't bear thinking about.\n\nI know it can be hard for some people to accept personal responsibility for things, but we are all responsible for this. Pollute less, use greener products and technology, only purchase food that has been caught, or farmed in an ethical, environmentally responsible manner, and don't vote in politicians who care more about profit than the future of the planet, the environment, wildlife, and humanity.\n\nEven if you don't believe in climate-change (and that's a really stupid, uneducated, uninformed, unethical, and illogical stance to take), it's not worth the risk. You might as well do the things mentioned above, because they're not only far more ethical, and better for humans, animals, and the environment, they're often more economically viable as well. You have no reason not to join the rest of humanity in this plight - especially if you live in the United States, a country that contributes far more than it's fair share of environmental destruction, pollution, and species extinction. \n\nAnd if you're wrong, your descendants are going to be the ones who suffer the most - and they'll curse you for your ignorance.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Just Another Happy Humanist", "channel": "UC5_ssAjNQTp1IplPpA6vb0A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSTE2GjwwEMEGR8CMP-XDmIKQPE5AYlUnMGUiY5bA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Your comment belies both extreme scientific illiteracy, and misinformation, on your part. No one claims that the world has never changed. The problem is that man-made climate change is causing the world to warm up unnaturally rapidly and extensively. This is causing increased climate problems globally - flooding, severe, unpredictable, dangerous weather patterns, and environmental damage. We're already seeing all of this on an increased scale. On top of this, the earth has previously through five major extinctions - global extinctions, during which most of the species on earth died out. Humans are now causing the sixth major extinction, and it's only getting worse due to climate change. The effects of all this affect much more than just the environment - there are, and will continue to be, an increasing amount of food shortages, health problems, death due to natural disasters and extreme weather, and refugees as a result of the same (who will then be at the mercy of wealthier, and better situated countries' charity), and much, much more.\n\nTry learning about the actual science, instead of listening to propaganda. You don't have to listen to Al Gore, or a random dude in a lab coat - just look at the actual data, because that's all that matters. All the available empirical evidence irrefutably demonstrates that we are in the midst of man-made climate change. And because of people like yourself, who don't do their due diligence, it's already too late to stop it. If we'd wanted to do that, we would have had to start decades ago. There's nothing we can do now to stop the chaos that we have wrought, but we can mitigate its effects...but only if we start ASAP, and even then, it may be too late. \n\nI know it can be hard for some people to accept personal responsibility for things, but we are all responsible for this.

There are around 80 to 100 maritime schools in the Philippines who offer these degrees. There are around 280,000 students who graduate from maritime schools every year. It was estimated that there were more than 250,000 Filipino seafarers;, that number has been estimated to have increased to about 460,000 Filipinos employed as seamen worldwide, more than any other nationality .The Philippines is one of the primary source of seamen in the global shipping and transport market. Filipino seamen are often recruited to man tankers and sea vessels from countries, including those from Denmark, North America, South America, Europe and Asia, such as Japan, the United States, Panama, Liberia, Cyprus, Bahamas, Jamaica, Greece, Malta, Singapore, Norway and so, not only in Germany. Mr Hines how could you say that it takes one kiribati to do a job that needs two Filipinos? stop fooling the Kiribati seafarers they are doing 2 jobs getting paid for 1.

{"cid": "UgxVg7clokTi_E_1YUx4AaABAg", "text": "I feel horrible for the people and their government. With no exports or industy on the islands the government does not have any financial resources to work with. They rely on mainly international aid for the existance. You can't tax a country with high unemployment. Most are scraping by without a real paycheck. The people, with basic donated equipment, can easily recycle the plastic rubbish found all over the islands into pavers, boards (for building walls, decking, home siding, railings, fences, etc, etc), and other items for everyday life. All it takes is simply equipment to melt the plastic and molding forms to put the warm placstic mush into to create bricks, road pavers, boards (just like Trex decking), etc, etc... There is a video showing one man doing that. Video link: https://youtu.be/xRxB6lyMNZ8 The government may be able to have plastic waste brought in from Hawaii or other countries to make products to build their seawalls. Old vehicles can be crushed (after they've been stripped of everything except the metal) and other inorganic rubbish can be used as fill to raise the land. The government and/or international aids organizations could hire dredging ships to reclaim the land and build up the atolls. Perhaps countries with dredging ships sitting idle may lend them to this beautiful island nation. The most important issue besides losing land is the constant flooding of their fresh water wells. The walls of the wells must be raised higher before doing anything else. They have concrete equipment on the island. The government could strike a deal with the concrete company to raise the well walls with a platform and stairs for the people to gain access to the wells. I'm shocked this wasn't done after the second or third time wells were flooded by seawater. Granted all of these solutions are only to extend the life of the island. Eventually, unless they continue to raise the land or build a levee around the each island the sea will raise too high to stop. A levee would require a breakwater to reduce the impact of waves on the levees and/or seawalls surrounding the islands.\n\nIt's a heartbreaking situation playing out like a slow motion catastrophe. And with the population increase now and the explosion of growth expected they either need to reclaim new land or ask volunteers to move to the new land they purchased. They do need some of the population to go to the new land to start development of the area keeping to keep their traditional way of life intact when they are forced to flee there. Otherwise the land may end up being developed like a western town or village. They risk losing their cultural identity. So long as it is developed to resemble their current lives, with the addition of modern amenities like plumbing and solar electricity, abandoning the island will be an easier transition.", "time": "3 years ago (edited)", "author": "Cameron Hollis", "channel": "UCzv_z_129Uw6QyQrsOqCNVw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRTzzKZ4De7ByUHXgviX2SQsD2FJgCan8a8o2mUbA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyeAAuRXpLfULvd5Tp4AaABAg", "text": "Ice melt does not raise sea levels,\nAssume there is an ice cube in a glass of water. When the ice cube melts, will the water level have risen, fallen, or remained the same? Why? \n\nIn the first state, we have an ice cube of mass m floating in the water. If it is floating (in equilibrium), it will have to displace enough water to support its weight. How much is that? It is just Volume = m/d , where m is the mass of the ice cube, and d is the density of water. \n\nIn the second state, where the ice has melted, it turns into water of volume.... Volume = m/d! exactly the same volume as it displaced before. So the added volume is the same, so the level of the water will not change. \n\nAs a matter of fact, as long as objects are floating (i.e. they don't rest on the bottom) they displace enough water to support their mass. Since by turning from solid to liquid, the mass of water does not change (well, maybe it does, due to mass-energy equivalence, but that's really negligible) it will keep displacing the same amount of water. \n\nHowever, note that this may not apply to everything. If you had solid alcohol floating in water, when it melts, the level would drop, because water and alcohol mix at the molecular level; i.e. water filling spaces among alcohol molecules.

With the average rate of sea level rise for the past hundred years of something like 3 mm/yr without any increase in rate of sea level rise and in fact I believe it was 2014 and 2015  the sea level went down. We need to stop attempting to reduce CO2 production. It is all in vane. We need to start thinking of ways of producing food when the temperature cools and affects our traditional means of growing. Instead of worrying about 3 mm/yr sea rise and consider the people in the world who will live longer when they have reliable energy. The problem of water shortage is probably the increase in island population. Looking at the kids or should I see libtards who are growing up learning the propaganda of Al Gore.

At least that way you won't have to worry about the sea rising and flooding your home or even wonder everyday whether you will have a future for your children on the island or not. Just look at the future trend. No country is going to stop emitting carbon and in the process lose out on millions of dollars in income just for the sake of saving a few tiny countries in the pacific from sinking. Whether climate change and rising sea levels sink the islands or not, in the future the sun will start to expand in size and heat up the Earth. It will cause the ice to melt and rise sea levels a lot. There is also a prediction that in the future there will be no races left because people will simply marry people from every other race and it will cause everyone to be of mixed race. That way no real culture will survive apart from urban culture. Forget about saving the island. It is already a sinking ship. Think about moving out of the island and saving yourselves and your family for the future. People all over the world are leaving their countries and moving to other countries for a better future. So what makes you on the islands so special that you don't want to leave the island? Your lives and the lives of your future generations are more important than your culture. Culture will continue to change no matter how much you try to preserve it. Just compare your culture of today with that of 3000 years ago. It is a lot different. Staying on the island and saving your culture is simply fighting a losing battle on a sinking ship!

The truth is we are on one of the largest Crustal Plate, called the \"Pacific Plate\", while most islands And continents are on Tectonic Plates, Hawaii is in the middle of a crustal plate which sits on a hot spot. The continental drift is moving this plate, which are below the ocean surface. If you look at Hawaii as a whole, we have a total of eight major islands,  then many small islands , atolls, and reefs spanning over a thousand miles. Over time our islands have moved. Our islands formed and changed over time. I have experienced the shift of each island.  Big Island is still growing and active, producing another island next to it because the island is on a hot spot on the Pacific plate. The landscape is long and slopey. Little to none beaches, with lava landscape.  On the other major island to the left,  which is Kauai the mountains have eroded and have a lot of white sandy beaches. The next island Oahu where I am born and raised , is the same. We have maps and photos of what our islands looked like before. I remember seeing beaches , but they are now under water. We have many sandbars , while other  sandbars I used to see as a kid are not visible . Volcanic activity produce Earth quakes which help move the plate, with that it has moved our islands to left of the pacific, slightly up. All the smaller islands , atolls and reefs were much bigger  before but sank over time as it moved deeper and farther from the hot spot. You will see this pattern happen for all the other islands in the Pacific,  such as Kiribati which is below Hawaii and is also part of this Pacific crustal plate. Hope this all makes sense now. It is sad that it is happening,  but those who are from the islands have to either adapt or find other larger islands to live on.

This means: any liquid water (within the Earth's gravitational field) tends/tries to get (flow/rain downwards) to the lowest points of the earth. Those \"lowest regions\" are what we call our oceans. All that liquid water settles to an equilibrium point -- which we call \"nominal sea level\". Tectonic plates do NOT rise/fall appreciably (except in edge subduction zones; even there they have little effect on \"sea level\").\n\nThus, the \"height\" of \"sea level\" (relative to the sea bed - which itself varies greatly and so is mostly not at a fixed height above the Earth's 3D center) is barely/insignificantly affected by tectonic (\"land\") activity. The height of \"sea level\" is almost entirely affected by where and how much water exists in ice/vapor form, all around the planet, vs. how much is in liquid form.  This means, the Percentage of solid (on land) + vapor (in atmosphere) composition of water (i.e., %-age in Polar/mountaintop regions plus %-age in clouds/air) ENTIRELY determines the level of the oceans (this level forms an equilibrium level, across the planet - we call this \"sea level\"). So only 2 things: Melting ice affects sea-level. And atmospheric + oceanic heat (causal cloud formation/rain) affects sea-level. Nothing else has any major effect on sea level on Earth.", "time": "3 weeks ago", "author": "Who knew ···", "channel": "UCG91mFDxbYp-0atY5-Qtjkg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRL3Lndm14ae2s_wqACLdNu_wt9qHFY-nxvdQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you're sick of hearing about climate change - and I am, too - then you should be doing everything in your power to mitigate it's effects. It's already too late for us to stop it. We should have started mitigating the damage decades ago. We're already seeing increased natural disasters as a result of man-made climate change, and those are only going to become more prevalent. We're going to see massive changes in our lifetime (we've already started seeing them), and complete societies are going to become displaced, meaning more refugees will become dependent on wealthier, better situated societies. It's too late to stop it, but we can try to slow it down, or mitigate its effects. The alternative doesn't bear thinking about.\n\nI know it can be hard for some people to accept personal responsibility for things, but we are all responsible for this. Pollute less, use greener products and technology, only purchase food that has been caught, or farmed in an ethical, environmentally responsible manner, and don't vote in politicians who care more about profit than the future of the planet, the environment, wildlife, and humanity.\n\nEven if you don't believe in climate-change (and that's a really stupid, uneducated, uninformed, unethical, and illogical stance to take), it's not worth the risk. You might as well do the things mentioned above, because they're not only far more ethical, and better for humans, animals, and the environment, they're often more economically viable as well. You have no reason not to join the rest of humanity in this plight - especially if you live in the United States, a country that contributes far more than it's fair share of environmental destruction, pollution, and species extinction. \n\nAnd if you're wrong, your descendants are going to be the ones who suffer the most - and they'll curse you for your ignorance.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Just Another Happy Humanist", "channel": "UC5_ssAjNQTp1IplPpA6vb0A", "votes": "11", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSTE2GjwwEMEGR8CMP-XDmIKQPE5AYlUnMGUiY5bA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Coming from the Hawaiian islands and studying Geology in the Pacific  , I have seen what looks like the rise of the seas changing. The truth is we are on one of the largest Crustal Plate, called the \"Pacific Plate\", while most islands And continents are on Tectonic Plates, Hawaii is in the middle of a crustal plate which sits on a hot spot. The continental drift is moving this plate, which are below the ocean surface. If you look at Hawaii as a whole, we have a total of eight major islands,  then many small islands , atolls, and reefs spanning over a thousand miles. Over time our islands have moved. Our islands formed and changed over time. I have experienced the shift of each island.  Big Island is still growing and active, producing another island next to it because the island is on a hot spot on the Pacific plate. The landscape is long and slopey. Little to none beaches, with lava landscape.  On the other major island to the left,  which is Kauai the mountains have eroded and have a lot of white sandy beaches. The next island Oahu where I am born and raised , is the same. We have maps and photos of what our islands looked like before. I remember seeing beaches , but they are now under water. We have many sandbars , while other  sandbars I used to see as a kid are not visible . Volcanic activity produce Earth quakes which help move the plate, with that it has moved our islands to left of the pacific, slightly up. All the smaller islands , atolls and reefs were much bigger  before but sank over time as it moved deeper and farther from the hot spot. You will see this pattern happen for all the other islands in the Pacific,  such as Kiribati which is below Hawaii and is also part of this Pacific crustal plate. Hope this all makes sense now. It is sad that it is happening,  but those who are from the islands have to either adapt or find other larger islands to live on.

So... any claimant of seas rising from climate change also needs to prove they know the total mass of land based ice on the planet and also prove it's dwindling.   That's about impossible:  at best we can estimate.  Sea borne ice flows melting would actually make sea level drop - but they don't differentiate, do they?  No - sea ice gets lumped into land ice fairly regularly.   If I remember correctly, it takes a land based ice mass of about 4,000 feet high the size of Greenland to raise ocean level 5 feet.   That does not include minor losses likely to occur as with more surface area of oceans, we can expect more evaporation and higher atmospheric moisture.  And with higher moisture, there will be more rain, which will cool off the atmosphere, and make more snowpack somewhere.

It was going to sink on trends that developed as soon as the volcano that built the atoll quit erupting and started eroding. It isn't climate change it is it is just normal erosion and rise and fall of atolls. That is why they are atolls.   The volcanic process causes very tall mountains above the sea.  Then the sea erodes the mountain and the center collapses as the volcano cools.  This forms the lagoon and then it forms the atoll.   Then the land further sinks until it disappears beneath the sea.   It happens all the time.  It isn't some climate change it isn't even a rising sea.

Could very well be the product of the \"coral fortress\" they built to protect their home and property.  I studied geomorphology and am aware that levies, sea walls, and the like alter natural sedimentary processes, often leading to greater erosion in one area and deposition in another.  Of course, I understand why they do it, and that they feel they have no recourse.  But just might be that they lost their beach because of the wall they build as much as for the rising ocean.\nAnother issue, at the end they speak of the population doubling on the main atol, yet nowhere in the documentary is there anyone addressing this problem.  Maybe they should be talking more about birth control to limit family sizes as the resources and available land diminish and contamination and pollution increase.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Stone W", "channel": "UCeKE88-RU3MbeREXGOoNWDA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRW6e4RUGlB7SzWeLsM7bh2y2n_cfi2zQ2eMA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It makes me sick when I think of the way this planet and its natural resources are being exploited and depleted all for the Mighty Dollar. I was born in 1969 I remember lining up to get gas and the car is getting smaller and smaller. That was probably the time we should have been really making some serious changes to the ways we live and the things that are important to all of us. The hippies said to love each other and to love our  Mother Earth but instead of listening to the message-hearing it- Nixon turned it into a War on Drugs. It really upsets me the mess we are leaving for future generations to have to deal with whatever we leave to them. Nature, the animals, the poor, and children, the ones with no rights and no value placed on them are the ones that suffer. I've often worried also about mining deep into this planet what if one side is mind harder and deeper and worse than another side will our planet start wobbling on its axis and shoot off into space? Things like this keep me up at night! Something's got to give and the right people need to be put in place to make the proper decisions for this planet as a whole.

It's the world engine and mankind, despite our arrogance, has cause some changes in climate, but in no way have we slowed it or speed it up. We are ant's living on it and the world changes as it has always done. Sea levels go up and down, temperatures go up and down, mass extinctions happen all on there own. Long before mankind even had two brain cells to rub together. The world changed and that will continue long after we are gone. We are just another organism on this planet and are not that special to be exempted from the forces of mother nature. Mankind DOES NOT CONTROL NATURE! Mankind CANNOT CONTROL how hot or cold the Earth gets! Mankind CANNOT CONTROL how strong the winds blow or how much it rains or where it rains! If humanity as a whole stopped everything it did today of what climate change morons say we are doing to make all these changes. The world wouldn't even notice because that is how insignificant we are! Volcano's will still erupt, forest fires will still ravage vast hectors of land! Coastlines will still erode and be created because this world is ever changing as this world is ever changing it's position and the poles move which makes the ice caps move with it. The agriculture belt will shift as the desert belt shifts and the monsoon belts shifts with it. What was once lush fertile land turns into the opposite as deserts become fertile lands. Oceans and lake beds dry up and new oceans and lakes are created and so on. Our world didn't always look like the maps we grew up learning in school and it will not always be that way either.

This isn't my area of expertise but, I kept thinking of the 'islands' that were created in Dubai with the huge machines that mine the sand from the sea to create areas where they've built 1000's of homes. Have they considered asking for their help? The leader of Dubai loves to create good news about himself & Dubai. Imagine how it would look for one of the richest men in the world coming to the rescue of a small country. People in the Middle East are very proud of their heritage & know how important it is. I would hate to see these people lose their homes & be scattered to the 4 winds. It wouldn't take too many generations before it would become a \"lost culture\".

Since 1880 the sea level rised by 1,57 (!) mm per year. . The cumulative rise of thev sea level from 1880 till today is therefore 216 mm  (8.5 inch) in 137 years ! .    Note also the diagram line of the  sea level risel is straight and NOT L-Shape.  That means  A STADY INCREASE of +/_ 1.57 mm PER YEAR SINCE 1880. . Logic  would suggest that, by considering the nonexistence of a mineral oil industry in 1880,  mankind could not have any influence in the sea level increase.   Furthermore, please look at the population growth  on that island since 1947.  2600 people in 1947 and in 2015 already over 50000.  Thie massive population increase, including immigration and tourism, required a relentless boom in construction and infrastructure. All the  houses, hotels, waterdams, fillings to gain additional land,  roads etc were all  made of local sand and coral stones.  The living  corals were killed by overharvesting the coral riffs, the dead coral stones remove and used for construction. Sand was taken uncontrolled for concrete constructions and much mangrove protection distoyed and removed for land gain. If they have flood now then it's because of all these careless constructions and not because of CO2 production on the other side of the world. That isva wrong and chep excuse.     DW made a bad decission to jump on that false idea that CO2 is responsible for the hardly  relevant increase of the sea level since 1880.\n Please study all these local made changes on the island. They messed up the atoll themselfes and face now the consequences. Now you helped them to blame others for their mistakes. Not good! \nI know that most countries agree on the CO2 issue. I guess, It is easy to agree on something you know that you can blame others for your own mistakes and even get money for it.   I also know that 1800 experts on climat change agree that the change is  man-made.  But so what ? Science is not be a democratic process for salary receiving scientists. Science is about the truth.

This documentary is the most deceiving video I've ever watched.  All islands in the South Pacific go through a life cycle.  They start out as volcanos like Hawaii and Tahiti and have massive mountains that jut out of the sea. Then they form outer reefs that protect the island from waves and tides.  But, over time, the island sinks in the middle leaving only the outer reef.  That is what atolls are, remnants of outer reefs.  Eventually the atolls are eroded into the sea which ends the island's life.  The atoll in this video is simply at the end of its life and will soon be eroded away as well.

Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not.

There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.

In the video it is mentioned they have between 5-6 children in each family.. But climate change is their problem.. you know the one caused by someone else.. Typical human behavior and ignorance that's the real issue here. Sweet people I hope they don't end up falling through the cracks of a crappy political system. However even if the waters dropped they would eventually destroy the island by overpopulating.  Reversible sterilization at a young age (world wide).. education and a sustainable income to support a family and ensure proper medical care and education for their children should be a requirement BEFORE a couple can start a family. Before a couple can reverse sterilization they should take classes to learn how to raise and care for children.. quality children and lives.. not quantity.", "time": "3 years ago", "author": "Mark W", "channel": "UCduY8Fmk0lBoOJDk1J379DQ", "votes": "16", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSVPqoxeaNffurvmcx1756qoMVZDsGTzeMl7A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Mankind is in for a rude awakening as ecological conditions continue to get worse. The subject of Ocean Acidification was not discussed. As the ocean's convert into carbonic acid, coral reefs are dying- some 80% of the Great Barrier Reef is now dead or dying due to coral bleaching. \nThe essential problem is too many people and too few resources. Every 365 days the global human population expands by a further 84 million. It now takes just 12 years for the human population to grow by a further 1 billion. Unlimited population growth would not be a problem except for one \"tiny\" problem- we live in a world with physical limits.\nWhen the epitaph is written for humanity it will read: 'Cleaver primate, although selfish, greedy, and fatally lacking in wisdom.  \n\"I'd like to share a revelation I had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area, you multiply, and consume until every natural resource is exhausted. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are the most pernicious pathogen to have ever existed.

There will be a few centuries of mild, temperate climate then the long road back towards the next ice age.  This is a continuous cycle, been going on for millions of years.  The cycling is tied to periodic sun activity which again cycles on a continuous bases.  This is nature.  It cannot be stopped or changed.  Yes, there are things we can do to lesson the impact, but we will never be able to change it.  Our biggest issue is not the burning of fossil fuels though this problem ranks up there in the top 2.  The real issue is over population.  There will be a time coming soon when the planet will not be able to support the amount of people requiring it's resources.  And the population increases are becoming exponentially getting worse as we proceed into the 22nd century.  Somehow in some way we must admit we have far too many people on this planet.  And each deforest action, each new chemical plant built to support human kind, each increase demand for more living space, each failed nuclear power plant continues to take more resources from our plant without putting anything back.  Human kind will be their own cause of destruction.  When will this happen, who knows.  It could be in the form of a super virus, a rouge asteroid, a wayward comet or a massive world war.  This will happen.  We just don't know when.  Our planet is over 4 billion years old.  Human kind has only been around for about 50000 years.  Do the math.  Be active in recycling.  Eat more vegetables, reconstruct aged living quarters instead of building new elsewhere.  And for heavens sake, stop having so many babies.  The population increase must stop and start going the other direction.  We are our own worst enemies.  But again, we a due a mass extinction event.  It is long overdue.

Because I wrote my doctoral dissertation on the evolution of Hawaiian coral community structure, have worked on ancient and modern reef investigations for 40+ years, monitored the drilling of hundreds of cores through reefs to study their internal structures, studied and worked on civil engineering projects on Heron Island, Australia, Guam, Majuro Atoll, offshore Jakarta, Indonesia, on six of the larger Hawaiian Islands, interpreted C14 data from reef cores, published and engineering geologic classification of coralline materials, and studied fossil rudisted reeefs in ,Mexico. I can assure you that AGW is real and causing climate change, including the melting of Arctic and Antarctic glaciers and sea ice to cause ocean warming to provide more energy to cause more intense tropical storms and hurricanes.
