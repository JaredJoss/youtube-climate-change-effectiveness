A virus floats in the air due to its size, and goes through a face mask like it isn't there for the same reason. There isn't a little size difference in hole size in face masks and viral size.... there's a lot. And, lastly, over fishing isn't destroying the seas, pollution by insecticides is. When did you last hear the song of a robin ? Or, crickets at dusk ? Over fishing had nothing to do with that either, did it ? We still spray on an industrial level, and still have mosquitoes, don't we ? Farmers produce crops en-mass that have no taste, and contribute nothing of value to anyone or anything, other than business.. We gotta eat, but some food IS better than others. I'm into seafood.

We are living in the last days of earth and Satan knowing that his time to be judged is short and running out, is seeking devour, hurt and destroy lives by various means. But God is in control and will soon put an end to these evils. (1 Peter 5:8 & Matthew 25:41) and he along with all his evil angels along with all sinners, those who refuse the Lord‚Äôs offer of Salvation through faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:8) and exchange their sins and unrighteousness (Isaiah 64:6) and receive His righteousness, through pardon and forgiveness of their sins. (Acts 3:20; 1John 1:9, John 1:12 and 1John 3:1).  \n     Day by day the Lord bears with the suffering, sickness, death and all that is the out flow of Sin (Genesis chapter 3).  He is suffering too because of His great Love for us and the free choice we were given to choose.  (Joshua 24:15).  However, He will soon put an end to All Sin. (Nahum 1:9).  Not only are humans hurting, but all creation (Romans 8: 20, 21).  Read the enter for much hope unto salvation.  But He is seeking to save as many as will surrender their lives to Him while probation last both for the church and the world, as He is long suffering not will that any should perish.‚Äù (2 Peter 3:9).  \n     These disasters are leading into a Time of Trouble, restricted freedoms and enforced Sunday Laws.  (Revelation 13:11-18).   God is Creator and nature is His servant to Him.  God alone is to be worshipped.  We are encouraged by the Lord to seek Him, because Jesus alone can save us. (Isaiah 55:6, 7; John 1:29 & Acts 4:12).  But the Lord will see us through. (Matthew 24:13).  He will have 2 groups of living saints sealed and saved (1) from the church 144,000 (Revelation 7:1-8) and a Great Multitude (Revelation 7:9, 10).  See Audio page 3 on website below to learn more.  He will then stand up for this people when every earthly support is cut off.  (Daniel 12:1).  We will have no other help, but the Lord alone.  Put your trust in the Lord.  The Lord will return for those who trust in Him. (John 14:1-3).  He will wipe away the tears and bring healing and make all things new.  (Isaiah 65:17-19 & Revelation 21:1-4). \nGet ready for what‚Äôs to come.  Jesus is coming soon!

Our great grand children will be suffering and paying for our mistakes and it will cost many times more to fix it if we don't do something about it now. Nations must work together to stop the causes of climate change because we can't afford to ignore it any longer. We are beginning to see the devastation from it now and it will only get worse every year. If our environment worsens for the world, which most experts agree that it will, it will cost future generations far more than if we do nothing now.  For Americans, if we do nothing, it means that insurers will be unable to pay for the millions of properties that will be lost in a single hurricane, let alone what we can expect to see during future hurricane seasons. Insurance was never meant to withstand global catastrophes such as rising sea levels and massive storms. Today it isn't a matter of if disasters will hit... but when!\n\nOne thing we can do to minimize the frequency and intensity of storms,  is to reduce the ocean temperatures that cause them.  We can reduce ocean surface temperatures by several degrees by creating clouds of water to shade the earth. If we do that, than we can reduce the severity of the storms. In the days following 9/11 in America, when all the aircraft was grounded, the temperatures went up by several degrees across the nation. I believe that is because of the lack of contrails created by air traffic. If we can have that kind of impact on our environment without even trying, imagine if we did try! We could use helium air ships to create high altitude contrails to help reduce some of the affects of global warming and it is something we can start doing today without risking any further damage to the planet.

People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth., for the powers in the heavens will be shaken.  Habakkuk 3 You crushed the head of the house of the wicked and stripped him from head to toe.

{"cid": "UgxUnnA1NOs5Bozpcx94AaABAg", "text": "Carbon taxes are folly. Deforestation is the problem. Reforestation or land set aside the solution. I‚Äôve witnessed it with my own eyes. \n\nBorn and bred in Africa I witnessed much of the climate change in Zimbabwe as forests were cut down for grain and tobacco cultivation and 80% of the land changed to grassland and semi-desert. The EU land set aside restores nature‚Äôs powers over the climate, fixing carbon dioxide and stabilising temperatures and rainfall.  Why else is earth‚Äôs atmospheric carbon dioxide just 0.04% when it straddles between Venus and Mars orbits each planet with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in excess of 90%? Carbon dioxide is not the demon, it is plant food and plants work for us providing us with food and controlling our climate to be most favourable for life. Carbon dioxide and fossil fuels are just side actors, just like police cars and ambulances are to accident scenes. Just because police cars and ambulances are present at every accident scene does not mean that they caused them. The same with carbon dioxide and fossil fuels, they were mere agents of deforestation but deforestation was the cause of environmental changes. \n\nSo the solution to gaining control over our environment is strengthening nature. \n\nThe first method can be used by you personally to indirectly alter the climate for the better. Change to a keto or paleo diet and minimise your carbohydrate intake. This will not only improve your health and eliminate T2D, but more importantly it will incentivise farmers to plant trees which bind soils and provide nuts and seeds for your keto diet. If you choose a high carbohydrate diet, farmers will respond by cutting down forests to grow grain for your food. So by altering your food intake to a keto or paleo diet, you alter the food chain and thus ultimately the climate. \n\nSee the best keto diet here https://youtu.be/gxLSxt2IKiQ\n\nThe second (macro) solution can bring about climate improvement is as follows. \n\n1) Build plant factories to feed 7.8 billion people and liberate land and water for forests\nhttps://youtu.be/dnCQuwCtqJg\nhttps://youtu.be/qGyAeqdkkbw\nhttps://youtu.be/ESuzrY2abAw\n\nSee examples of working plant factories\nhttps://youtu.be/5clOYWsNhhk\nhttps://youtu.be/4CMfPLEtQMQ\n\n2) Use cattle herds to revitalise soil\nhttps://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI\n\n3) Use goats to reduce fire dangers in forests\nhttps://youtu.be/g9yiclBCxMo \n\n4) Use agrivoltaics to turn deserts into meadows with solar panels\nhttps://youtu.be/XwFB22r9zRo\nhttps://youtu.be/CS3bBO05fpU\n\n5) Use marine cloud seeding to moisten and seed ocean air for clouds and rain\nhttps://youtu.be/Awf1W0-UMR4\n\n6) Use minerals to assist salmon populations \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haida_Salmon_Restoration_Corporation\n\nBe positive. Be useful. Don‚Äôt be misanthropic with the debunked carbon dioxide nonsense.

While China manufactures a lot and also contributes to climate change heavily, this is mostly done for American corporations, to sell products to Americans.  Since US currency is given value by the sale of oil, it is called the \"petro dollar\" as it is the only currency usually accepted in such transactions. In this way the US dollar is dependent on oil, and the US military has a strong vested interest in ensuring this continues and people still use oil. Thus nothing will ever happen to significantly deal with Climate change until US government changes this. But as this petro-dollar is the primary means of controlling other countries in an economic empire, the US government will not do this. (hence sanctions can be placed on countries like Venezuela which sell oil without the US dollar, this is also why Iraq was invaded, but lies abound)", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Gunk Wretch", "channel": "UCRO5hta7PO0vO4HTh9bTyJQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTMLb5n1L9D-evLXyqPDqaaHlAW435hqRin96jm=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Humankind has always experienced all kinds of trouble due to climatic changes, from the ice ages, to the formation of deserts like the Sahara, to the climate changes that lead to the downfall of the Roman Empire and other civilizations. The great hoax about climate change is not about its existence, which is undeniable: it is about making people believe that we can control the climate and that it is just lack of political will that keep us from doing it. The truth is we do not even understand the climate well. We are extremely far away from anything close to controlling it. In fact we do not even know what climate would be the best for humankind. There has been no discussion about this fundamental issue. What kind of climate do we want in the world? Which one is the most favorable for humankind? What happens if this climate favor some countries and undermines others? Where is it written on stone that the current climate is the optimum?

It is a beautiful thing you are doing. We must tell everyone! Jesus doesn't want us to suffer. He isn't a fairytale and it hurts him so deeply that is how you see him. Because he died for you to have a way to heaven. Sin has to be punished somehow, and he took it all for you. We know it is real because we feel him and see him. You won't hear him if you choose not to listen. Let him show you. Tell him, God if you can reveal yourself to me, I dedicate my life to you and I accept that you died for me to save me. He will show you but you have to ask him to come in. When the holy spirit enters you, he will mold you to be a loving person... to forgive... not to be judgemental or hateful or have pointless debates. Christianity is not a religion, it is a relationship and this is very different. He loves you and I wish you all could see. He loves you sooooo much, even the ones who slander him and put him down. Afterall, he died on the cross while they mocked him and ask God to forgive them, for they know not what they do.... he knows it is confusing. He knows life is hard. But these things must pass for us to have a relationship with him. Once you know him, you no longer have to live in fear. You live in peace knowing, no matter what happens, Jesus will never ever let us down.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide creates and fuels life on Earth, and is a precious asset like water, not a villain to be feared.  CO2 is colorless, odorless, nontoxic, and is most definitely NOT a pollutant.  If we could triple atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which would be very difficult to accomplish, we would only make plants grow faster, bigger, and more resistant to drought.  We would not alter Earth‚Äôs average temperature, which varies up and down due to natural forces that have nothing to do with the tiny trace gases.  CO2 represents just .04% of our atmosphere and methane just .00017%. \r\n\r\nThe sun is the dominant controller of Earth‚Äôs temperature.  The Earth‚Äôs average temperature is now only .8 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in 1880.  A temperature increase of less than one degree Celsius is not a ‚Äúclimate crisis.‚Äù  Carbon dioxide and methane have no influence on temperature other than by their miniscule contribution to atmospheric mass, which creates atmospheric pressure.  NASA space probe data shows us that the atmospheric pressure of planets plus their distance from the sun determines average temperature, not a greenhouse gas effect.

We all have lost  Everybody has fallen  And every time we still remember it, right?  That it hurts a lot the first time  It hardly felt that it would heal, and eventually it hurts as the body began to repair itself  That pain has gone away.  We became mischievous again.  In which many events that go through that, if it is a little  We assume that it must happen because it is learning for sure.  But if the events that are going to happen to us over and over again and again and again are very painful, and it's not just physical pain, but it's so serious that we are all too hard to make it go away.  Well, it is the source of all problems that we all have no control over.  For all of us can only accept it and tell ourselves that we are powerless, we cannot do anything.  And we all just managed to run away from that pain and still let it happen without anyone really able to stop it.  And then we all accept that fate  Because of our own excuse on the day when we had the opportunity to permanently stop it, but we did not dare to open our hearts to ourselves.  We accidentally hurt and insult one of our friends with whom he might be able to help us in solving all of those problems.

To answer my own question, it comes from producing goods and selling them to earn the carbon tax money, which in turn pollutes environments even more. Moreover, at least before Covid-19 came roaring into our lives, most people were obliged to travel to work so that money could be earned to pay for living costs, including carbon taxes. Most people have no choice but to travel to work, and should not be punished with extra taxes for doing what social conditions force them to do. While the tax may indeed discourage unnecessary travel, the effort will be dwarfed and nullified by the added income that must be earned to pay for the tax....

About 12000 years ago we had an ice age when most of the northern hemisphere was covered by ice. How did all the ice disappear? The answer is an extremely accelerated global warming and the carbon content in the atmosphere was all time high at the end of the ice ago when the temperature started rising... unfortunately (or fortunately) the earth is still on its warming phase as of the year 2020. How did it happen? Did our stone age ancestors burn too much fossil fuel? Of course not. It's mainly because of astrophysical reasons such as the wobble of earth rotating axis and orbiting distance, etc.. And the earth has experienced much more devastating climate extremes in the past according to ancient historians and geological evidences. This warming trend will continue (arctic ice and glaciers will continuously shrink) until the earth switches back into another cooling phase leading to the next ice age.

{"cid": "Ugxqaj_Hj1Yldhs6z894AaABAg.9HwgFYipTLx9Hz59rz7qjn", "text": "¬†@dee b¬† \nThe following is my response to your comments.  I am in no way trying to insult you.  I'm am only presenting my take on the Bible from studying it.\n\nbelieve in God's word Not the propaganda coming from this system.\nCan you prove what is written in the Bible came from God?  Or do you just have Faith that leads no one to truth!\n\nGod didn't inspire the Bible.  I say this because if God inspired the Bible, it would not be so ambiguous requiring interpretation, or full of errors!\n\nSome big Errors in the Bible\n\nGenesis 1;11\n\"And God said, \"Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.\" And it was so.\nGod creates the earth and Trees and Plants before God created the Sun and the Stars.  How does that work?\n\nGENESIS 2;4-3;24 Adam and Eve\nEvolution, which is true based on fossil records demonstrating evolution through speciation debunks the Adam and Eve story.  Denying evolution, given all the evidence for evolution, for a fairy tale of two people, where God put them in a lovely place, but also put in a temptation God knew they would fail is sick!  God is supposed to know everything including the future so God set them up for failure!  That's an evil God!\n\nGenesis 7‚Äì8 The Great Flood\nWe now know, through Science investigation that there could have never been enough water to flood the entire earth above the tops of mountains.  Even if you consider the groundwater, there is still not enough.  Many apologists who realize a \"World Flood\" is not physically possible, resort to calling it a local flood.  This completely contradicts the Bible.  Therefore the proof these words were not inspired by God.\n\nGenesis 11;1‚Äì9  Tower of Babalon\n\"But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. 6 The Lord said, ‚ÄúIf as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.‚Äù\n\nNot having a common language has not stopped people from working together.  We see this today.  Besides, why was God not stopping people today building skyscrapers much higher than any Tower that could be built back then.  God does not seem to be bothered.\n\nJoshua 10;13\n\"So the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation took vengeance upon its enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? ‚ÄúSo the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.‚Äù\n\nGod stopped the Sun and the Moon for a full day so there would be more daylight for fighting.  So how can the Sun and moon stop for a full day?  Plus, back then, they thought the Sun rotated around the Earth and we know the opposite is true so did a perfect God get this wrong?\n\n10 Bible reasons why a wife must submit to her husband regardless of culture:\nhttps://www.bible.ca/marriage/submission-independent-of-culture.htm\nThroughout the Bible, women are cast as lower than men.  Women are not well respected in the Bible and this is evident that a women's name in the Bible is rarely mentioned but Men's names are always mentioned.\n\nOther than \"Faith,\" which is not evidence, is there any actual evidence of what is written in the Bible is true?\n\nWhy are you not a Muslim or a Hindu?\nThey believe in what they are taught!  Are they wrong?  If you comment yes, please provide evidence to support your claims.\n\n I do not believe the Bible was inspired by God and is the words of men trying to explain our existence.  Note how God changes personality from the Old Testimate to the New Testimate.  A clear indication the Bible is not inspired by God, the perfect being!", "time": "8 months ago (edited)", "author": "valveman12", "channel": "UCgp4fA-C6_I4k3PtRQepZuA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSYXa17ee7rNQiDKzbgb3yH04xJJB6JbMpJKIa1=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwYruZ-0nBwhckYG0t4AaABAg.9HweouQuDvY9HzQ2e1SjB7", "text": "¬†@TheTK¬† I am almost certain you do not believe this truth, but in the beginning of time, we used to actually live a pretty long time. People‚Äôs age range of living, was from about 60-969. But then God decided that man should live only up to about 120 years. The Word is the truth and the Truth is God and The Word is God. It‚Äôs so much that I could on about honestly, but the thing is the Word (or Bible as some people call it, which I do not condone) is not to be debated as if it were a political debate or a science project. That is why there are many false/ignorant believers/followers (or Christians as they and others refer to them/themselves which I also don‚Äôt condone) As I am not here to establish a religion. Religion is a man-made construct among other false things. Who give a false sense of him, and hey I‚Äôve done it too. I‚Äôm sorry on all our behalf‚Äôs us true followers who mess up. \n\nFollowing Jesus/God is to be part of his Kingdom. The Kingdom of God, that is. I know where you are at somewhat, because I used to have a very negative ideology towards Jesus and what he stands for. The reason being.. because simply...I did not have eyes to see and hears to hear. You can go back and forth with scripture, and it is not a crime or sin I should say, but when you try to figure it out as if it were your AP/IB Calculus project, it is impossible to understand it. That what I was trying to do. It was just a load of bologna to me! I‚Äôm not here trying to twist your hand (God forbid!) because I‚Äôll tell you this right now, no human being ever will ever be able to convince you of the Truth, which is Jesus/God/Holy Spirit besides God himself. But I‚Äôll tell you something else. You hold the keys to unlock the Truth. To see what‚Äôs really going on in the universe. To see, why it is, that you have felt like calling it quits. Why it is that no one quite really understands you to the T... not even yourself if you reflect with maturity and honesty upon yourself. Who can be so sure of themselves? If so, we‚Äôll then I‚Äôd be perfect already! As I was saying, yes indeed you do have the keys! It‚Äôs called faith. This is how you receive the Holy Spirit. Having faith that Jesus is real, that he‚Äôs not a folklore character, because someone mustered up the brains enough to create this long and intricate fable story book. The Holy Spirit would love to make an abode in your temple (your body) and he‚Äôll lead you and guide you‚Äîyou gotta have faith, though, that through whatever it is, he‚Äôll see you through‚Äî because faith is hard, I‚Äôll be the first one to call myself out! In the start of my walk.... my faith was very shaky. I had ups and downs, kept trying to slip and go back to my old ways (my wisdom, my understanding, the worlds wisdom/understanding)  and Jesus didn‚Äôt give up on me! I got better and better! Every fall I had, whatever it was, my spirit was growing stronger! Like a workout almost if you will? So yes every fall, quicker to rise and stand firm! lasting longer from my fall! The thing that kept me going was, I know Jesus can get me through! If I slipped up it‚Äôs because it was my fault! More and more I began to take accountability and responsibility. Even though I could not see it! I was like well, honestly, I sorta feel like this is someone else‚Äôs fault (be it God or human or whatever) it was like a half-half type of recognition on my part. It was a ‚Äúyes! But....‚Äù excuse attitude for myself. Faith is key, as corny as that might come off. It‚Äôs the foundation of your walk. And faith is believing and    Not   seeing... which as it sounds is scary.    I had so much pride in me, that gosh...led to many problems in my life! Pride is a sneaky/cunning devil! He knows just how to get you. But your God is the Most High God and  you can  overcome. Ask Jesus to help you have faith in him. To give you those eyes to see and ears to hear! To reveal to you all lie and deceit not just in the universe but within yourself as well as your life. You‚Äôd be surprised.....   \n\nRead these aloud if you would? They truly hold power. These words are living. \n\n\"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.\" \"And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.\" \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.\n\n7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.\n\n\nIf any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.\n\n\nLike I said, I‚Äôm not here to convince, as I cannot. But to share the Truth to whom ever I can.   It‚Äôs up to you, to believe (have faith)     Take care.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "Ariel Salem", "channel": "UCG-k9s-dGYFKWgsTjdmMz6w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTBuv2ca1J2lrd4cKtkQ2WXGUT43PwkIBJ7FkkG=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgwYruZ-0nBwhckYG0t4AaABAg.9HweouQuDvY9I-1vOSOyJt", "text": "¬†@TheTK¬†    Yeah God can seemingly appear to ‚Äú‚Äùus‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù as ‚Äúillogical‚Äù because we have human brains..(which is why we need to humble ourselves unto the Lord God Jesus Christ)  because whatever can‚Äôt be ‚Äúproved‚Äù by science/math or whatever, is just too much for us to wrap our little human brains around, because again we are humans.. and it comes off as ‚Äúillogical‚Äù \n\nLike water for instance, which is something the Holy Spirit has shown me and I‚Äôve told others as well. All this time we have just been walking around through water right? I put a de-humidifier on for some hours and it legit collected maybe like 5-8 glasses of water in there. And I thought to myself wow... this whole time these glasses full of water have just been floating through my atmosphere ... where I breathe! Oxygen! And h20! Woah! Stellar huh? Yet I couldn‚Äôt see it with my eyes but it didn‚Äôt change the Truth that it was there.  Ages ago if you told someone that and in all your being you knew the thing to be true without a doubt, they would call you a crazy person! A witch! A charlatan! Time after time, God proves us, how lowly we are as creation. Yet we remain stiff-necked! and close minded! as you are. That is why you can‚Äôt access God. Because you are proud/prideful. Even if you want to believe in Jesus or already do! You get resistance from him.    ( James 4-6 check it out please, it‚Äôs logical, as you seem to show favoritism  towards logic)     \n\nHe‚Äôll help you out as he did for me but a huge reason the road has been so bumpy for me is because of my pride, which I now see because I believe in him.   (Have faith in Jesus, that is. Glory to the Most High God!)      I‚Äôm still battling it everyday. Albeit, I can for sure humble myself way better now and receive correction from him so that I may be humbled, so that I may be wise, and so that I may be of understanding. (His divine infinite perfect in all his ways, wisdom/understanding‚Äînot faulty, and imperfect wisdom/understanding..... like ours is as humans and the other false entities roaming this universe)   So:  I take the scolding and rebuke with maturity/humility although it doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel so ‚Äúnice and sweet‚Äù at hand,  reason being is  I see and hear the growth there is in taking heed to his perfect correction. It is not for my harm but rather for my well-being. Like when you get scolded by a teacher for missing an assignment or your parental figures for doing mal. Even if you don‚Äôt have the maturity level to comprehend their correction so that you might take heed unto their better sound judgment, it doesn‚Äôt change the truth of them being right. You can either stay there and ‚Äúbe right‚Äù in your pride and ultimately cause yourself to remain stupid or swallow it and bring yourself to humility. So : that you can grow and learn to be better. Check out Proverbs 12:1. It‚Äôs logical, and you love logic, right? You can never go wrong with your logic, right? That‚Äôs why you prefer it right?   You rely on logic you say, correct? \n\nLogical :  of or according to the rules of logic or formal argument\n\nLogic : reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity.\n\nSo like math right? Or like science right? So that‚Äôs uhm.....like logical right? Well here‚Äôs some math which  is * inserts italics for the word typically*    typically emphasis on  ‚Äútypically‚Äù because you see here we have some beautiful math being drum roll    illogical!   But yet you rely on math and on science right? Because that‚Äôs what the U.S and every other nation confide in by default. Because If the case were that we did truly fully rely on God as Adam and Eve did at one point till they were prideful and disobeyed because they relied on their wisdom and their understanding not God‚Äôs.   So yeah they actually did have a perfect utopia. It‚Äôs when we become prideful that we get the old ball called ‚Äúour down fall‚Äù to get rolling.  \n\nMath being illogical below : \n\n\nThe following taken from a game show:\nThe candidate would have to predict behind which of three doors the price would be. What‚Äôs the probability to guess the right door? Right, that‚Äôs easy: 1/3. The probability that the prize is behind a given door is 1/3 for each door.\nAfter the candidate has chosen ‚Äúhis‚Äù door, one of the remaining doors ‚Äî not containing the prize ‚Äî is opened. At this point the candidate is offered the opportunity to change his choice to the other remaining door.\nShould he change his selection? After all, we have just said that the probability that the price is behind any given door is 1/3 for each door.\nApparently many mathematicians at that time were convinced that changing the selection at that point would not provide any benefit. The few convinced otherwise actually had to remind the many that mathematical facts are not decided by popular vote.\nIn reality however, the probability that the price is behind the ‚Äúother‚Äù door is twice as high (2/3) as the probability that it is behind the door initially selected. Why is this?\nThe probability that your original choice was correct is not influenced by showing another door without prize. There‚Äôs always another door without prize. So it stays at 1/3. Since we know that the opened door does not have the prize behind it (probability equals to 0), the probability x that the prize is behind the second door is 2/3, because the sum (1/3 + x + 0) must be one. If you‚Äôre not convinced, it‚Äôs easy to write down all possible outcomes of this game on a piece of paper and count.\nIf you find this counter-intuitive, imagine another game with 1000 doors. You select one door, then you are being shown 998 doors without prize. Knowing that the prize must be either behind the door you have initially picked or behind the second door not initially picked ‚Äî do you think it‚Äôs more likely that you originally picked the right door out of 1000, or that the prize is behind the other remaining door?\n\n\nAnd yes all nations besides those individuals who fear and reverence the Lord God Almighty by default do not rely on Jesus because if that were so, we wouldn‚Äôt be where we are now. We‚Äôd all run to God instead of modern science/technology/math.....but .....I mean, at the end of the day...they‚Äôre sorta all intertwined right? \n\nDon‚Äôt be stupid, please.
