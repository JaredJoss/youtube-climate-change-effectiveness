{"cid": "UgwaCdGMFoJlPofvjap4AaABAg", "text": "It is all about you, your loved ones and your offspring who exist in reality and in manifestations of your dreams. I am aware this talk was given out by Dan Miller with a deep concern that he took the initiative to share more than five years ago. Thanks Dan for breaking out of the waiting queue. Five years is like 5 minutes when it comes to the subject of Global Warming. That's not a joke, trust me! We may not feel the difference over our entire life time and not realize our due role to save the planet for our future generations at the moment of our death. The solution of TAX to Dividend proposed by him can be one of several solutions. The less we depend on the government that has many more past and current problems as a bigger burden, the better pragmatic solutions we can devise. It is our joint responsibility as a human team including people old, young, children, male female, rich, poor etc, from the global nation to listen, understand, ponder over, evaluate the situation by a process in our left brain, right brain and heart with due respect to the concern originating people like Dan who have taken the pains to bring out a concern with the genuine quest for a solution. The national boundaries we perceive are not real. Not in the case of Global Warming. Covid-19 has proved this point. Global Warming will not be impacted by social distancing.  So we need to put our heads and hearts together to focus on topics like: minimize deforestation, transition to electric vehicles, encourage or actively take up research and development on hybrid power generation from solar, wind and hydro energy apart from moth-balling all nuclear plants. Nuclear plants do not produce CO2 but these plants produce pollutants heavier than CO2 in effective damage. Trust me, I have performed the lead role as  Station Engineer, in a nuclear plant operation crew in the 80s. Focus on evolving  deserts into forests! It is possible!! We just need to trust and inspire the young potential heroes and experts among us who love to prove their talents in saving the planet - our Mother Earth. I strongly urge and love to invite all concerned on this subject, in the age group of 11 to 111 years, purely for the joy of life on Mother Earth who loves to take care of our offspring, to participate in a brainstorming session some time. It is forthcoming soon after we see your responses to this comment. Enjoy life!

The trouble is that the theory of carbon dioxide-induced global warming is not supported by both historical and empirical evidence, the human contribution to atmospheric CO2 is a mere 3% and even if we have 0% man-made CO2 emission, we still have 97% of CO2 from natural sources to contend with. That is, if we assume that higher CO2 and/or higher global mean temperature is bad. Again, there is no evidence of such badness, eg extreme weather conditions. In fact, the contrary may even be true - higher CO2 is good for life on the planet and warmer climates have positive effects on agriculture and human well-being. If you/we advocate throwing trillions of dollars in vain of reversing something which does not need reversing, we know that the real issue is not the environment or human well-being; but it’s a scheme for a select few to get big money at the expense of the common man.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Daniel Lee", "channel": "UC3tH5a7vYwQzzrVo4CB7ZFQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ_J6ytFyAm5UwxetWcTG4he_bGY4Nqk6Sao4GVvw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it.\n\nIf that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support.\n\nBut that is not what the human species wants to do,  it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with  population control,  it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. \n\n Physics law two)\n\nIt is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving.  No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind.\nNow you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck.\n\nThis should tell you, if you are as intelligent as you all claim to be?  it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing.\n\n The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer.\n\nThe answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. \n\n So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support,  then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. \n\nThese two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one .\n\nIf anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong,  get a limited space like a cup or any other limited space which your daily life is full of, then show me how you can endlessly pour water or anything else into it without it ever overflowing. Without trickery , And I will admit I am wrong.\n\nI will not be losing any sleep, because to do so you will have to break the laws of physics.\n\n\nDo not listen to scientists  either side,   just use your basic common sense and that should tell you who is right and who is wrong and that simple law of physics that you practice every single day of your life,  so you don't overfill anything.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Joe Wood", "channel": "UCGiPtbrpny6RarpkTdrfz2g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS63NstucXB0MVoeIK6xdTFv10Y25HdWiVl8hqH6A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz9xHfJWUtUgZGb4ZZ4AaABAg", "text": "As the third-world economies emerge and world population grows, can we expect citizens to accept draconian measures that change the way they live? \nLet’s ask the tough questions before we force massive lifestyle changes — or spend trillions that could otherwise combat world hunger, fight illiteracy, discover new cures, or raise third-world living standards.\nFor each of the six questions below, let's answer in support of climate change. However, a \"no or not sure\" is an indicator that massive expenditures or lifestyle changes are not warranted.\n1.    Is the world warming? Between 1998-2015 there was an 18-year pause in rising temperatures. Some climatologists think a new ice age is more likely to occur.  We are living at the very tail-end of an ~11,000-year warmer inter-glacial period.  Massive glaciation is the norm for the earth.\n2.    Does climate change pose a threat to the planet? Seas are rising ~2mm/year, about 7-9 inches per century. Temperatures increased about 0.7C since 1850. A doubling of CO2 from 400ppm to 800ppm would only lead to another 0.7C increase. How does this make life, as we know it, end in the next 12 years, as some politicians claim?\n3.    Is climate change being caused by humans? Or is it all part of evolving world cycles, e.g., solar activity? Earth has been much hotter and much cooler. CO2 levels have varied from 180ppm to almost 7,000ppm (last 140M years). The great civilizations flourished in times warmer than today. Greenhouses regularly operate at 1,200ppm. Plants thrive in higher concentrations of CO2; crop yields increase. The earth has been visibly greening the last 30 years!\n4.    Are there practical things we can do? If we go back to an 18th-century lifestyle, the impact on temperature would be minimal — would all trees be cut down just to stay warm? What exactly is “The Plan” — is there a sensible one? Is it achievable? \n5.    Are they affordable? Who pays for all this climate change remediation? The U.S. is already $22 trillion in debt. How do we balance this with demands for increases in social programs?\n6.    Do we have the political will? Are citizens of the world willing to allow our leaders to implement changes that could directly affect our freedoms, pocketbooks, and consumption patterns? Do we need a one-world-government to have the power and authority to enforce the rules? Now, that would be a \"real change\" worth noting.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Colorado Ron", "channel": "UCy_GuhcHOVOF7SGyKR0UHAg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTDYWk-SpGKaf9FyQd3s-R2_4Ndc5MYKrmrBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Australian fires are from poor undergrowth management rather than the warming; just talk to the original indigenous peoples of that continent.\nThe real encouraging thing is that some have really workable solutions to energy needs that are safe and polution free, that are much more efficient than wind and solar farms. I woukd like to suggest you study the new molten salt cooled nuclear, which has the following extraordinary charactristics.\n- Can't suffer melt down, it's already molten.\n- Walk away safety, self shut down in the event of climbing core temporatures or circulation failure.\n- Can burn existing stocks of nuclear waste.\n- Energy density per nuclear decay is a million times that of a carbon-hydrogen bond changing to a carbon-oxygen bong in fossil fuel burning.\n- 500-600 C heat from the system can be harnessed for other really useful industrial processes.\nAnd so on.\nSadly the picture from the IPCC, stinks of the corrupted aim to frighten and control humanity. Follow the money and power agendas!\nSorry, Dan, but I didn't hear very much in the presentation that rang true. I remain convinced that climate change has several other causes than man made CO2 and that this is a small proportion of total CO2 produced and an even smaller proportion of total greenhouse gasses. The Sun's heat output, cosmic radiation, cloud cover, Earth to Sun distance, precession and tilt, ocean currents are all implicated. They have all been happening for millions of years and trying to reduce or eliminate our hard won industrial environment won't affect the warming rate significantly.\nCO2 is absolutely not a pollutant, being colourless, odourless and harmless to all living beings. It's plant food and without it we all die.\nMy first degree was Biochemistry, Manchester University and carbon fixation was my pet subject. Photosynthesis and that fixing of CO2 by chloroplasts is phenomenally complex chemistry, almost as complex as the chaotic thermodynamics of climate and weather.\nPlease don't give up trying to find honest truth amid the gale of propaganda.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Ordinary Bloke", "channel": "UCNVoP7filHKtwZeG9dcZ_6g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShFtcbERqn4xCDH3Ym3zDwumXJ3EmCqC_U0g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Let's just say that you can use as much wind as is available and back up using fossil fuels (for now) and other techniques shortly.  Storage is available now and the price is dropping rapidly (batteries are currently beating out natural gas for peaker plants).  There are also new grid approaches such as demand response that are in use now and can be deployed on a broader scale for little cost.

The populace will not accept a reduction in their standard of living.    There will be a serious political struggle , mainly because  a solid argument can be made that the risks associated with abandoning fossil fuels are greater than the ones associated with a slight temperature rise.  You can speculate about a 4 centigrade increase (which would actually be a blessing for Canada), but it is nothing more a speculative guess by climatologists.    I read somewhere that Al Gore has been wrong on 51 of his predictions!   I've seen it argued persuasively that we are at the end of a 12,000 year interglacial period, and it is more likely we will be cooling in the future, descending into another 90,000 year ice age.  Where I live, there was 1.5 miles of ice a short 18,000 years ago.  Ocean levels have risen 400 feet in the past 18,000 years, nothing to do with mankind burning fossil fuels.  I believe these theories are accepted by most geologists, but they certainly aren't  common knowledge or often referred to in the hysteria over climate.  I also find that when I mention these geological suppositions to family members over Xmas dinner, they aren't so concerned anymore about the \"climate emergency.\"  Essential knowledge about geology needs to become part of the public discourse on climate as a necessary blowback against the climate hysteria that has emerged in the past few years.

People who want to save the planet know that the planet having been ripped apart tectonically and put back together is in no need of saving, it has been around for 140,000,000,000 years and will be around long after we have left it (for other worlds hopefully). What they really mean is that they would like to stop it changing because they selfishly want to leave it how it is now because it is human friendly and they want to force it to stay that way but to disguise their selfishness to make it sound selfless and more heroic.\n3. We are in a long glacial cycle iceage but the earth is warming because we are in an interglacial break... The earth,long term, is normally far cooler that this current period and that once this respite ends the normal cooling of the Earth will return killing off all life that can’t adapt. Remember we are 20 times more likely to die of cold than heat. We have had 5 ice ages that were near extinction events already.\n4. Co2 has only a mild and short term effect as a greenhouse gas and it’s already absorbed and radiated as much heat as it can by the time we reached 200ppm in the atmosphere.\n\nRadiative forcing or climate forcing is the difference between insolation (sunlight) absorbed by the Earth and energy radiated back to space. Changes to Earth's radiative equilibrium, that cause temperatures to rise or fall over decadal periods, are called climate forcings.\n\nIt is a property of co2 that it is able to absorb radiation only in the 14-16 micrometer band of back radiation. This range has been exhausted by the time we reached a co2 level of 200ppm. The latest NASA spectrum readings show that there is no free energy in that band left to be used by co2, it has all been absorbed and used. Therefore any extra co2 introduced into the environment can not increase back radiation and hence warming because the remaining warming is outside the radiation band it can absorb. Kind of like trying to make a red wall redder by laying more paint on it.\n\nIncrease in global temperatures is therefore not proof of increased back radiation of co2. Another reason for warming must exist and there are many many other reasons this may be occurring. \nMost of the models used by the IPCC are biased on co2 and assume it is the culprit despite being continually wrong for 40 years and use double or more the actual increases of co2 emissions currently being delivered. As I have said in another post - the proof of a model is it’s predictions and theirs are totally worthless despite billions spent on them annually.

It is willing to pay the carbon fine. The UN is giddy over all the money rolling in just from company X so they send it country Oshkosh which is very poor. Oshkosh is now able to field light bulbs.  The UN folks are so giddy they think they are going to win the Nobel Peace Prize. But the folks in region Z, the few that there are are not happy. See they have been keeping up with the literature but they see a lot of stuff coming out of that factory & they say hey I thought all this climate stuff was to shut these people down. But you these people are too poor to move & too poor to lobby so X continues on. Well the squawking gets a tad louder to call attention to the UN. You see the folks  in Z believing in all the lit really want the company to shut down. But the folks in the UN say if we shut them down, no money comes in for us to send to Oshkosh. O my what to do. We really want our Peace Prize. If we shut X down, the train stops & we can't help Oshkosh.  Now therein lies the tragedy of the commons.  One man's pollution is another's treasure.

All the life you see on Earth developed while CO2 was between 280 and 415 parts per million.\n3.  Life did fine during the Ice Age when CO2 was about 180 ppm.\n4.  Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 levels by about 40% (from 280 to 415 ppm).  We haven't doubled it yet.  The +1ºC warming so far came from that ~135 ppm increase but more warming is in the pipeline from the current elevated CO2.\n5.  A doubling of CO2 (to 560 ppm) would increase temperatures by additional 2 to 4ºC in the short run and more later.  Recent studies show that a doubling in a warming world leads to more warming than previously thought (hence the 4ºC additional warming possibility).\n6.

The majority of these steps are missing in the climate alarm hypotheses, so there has not been any fair peer review.\n\nThose people who have challenged various climate change hypotheses have been routinely smeer atacked, have had their funding pullled by way of political pressure, and have been forced out of their research jobs at universities.\n\nAs for the things you claim are just facts based on measurements, they are just cherry picked data for specific time periods from particular data sets.\n\nA 1°C rise in temperature since the industrial age?  Over what exact time period?  Is this a change in the average global temperature or in a particular region?  Are the start and end average temperatures a 30 year moving average or are they just average temperatures for a single year?  How did the the set of temperature sensors change over the period of measurement?  Certainly, in the preindustrial period, these measurements were made by individuals reading thermometers, so how often each day were readings taken and recorded?  The sad truth is that even today, if we just use ground based sensor data, we cannot get an accurate global temperature simply because we do not have enough sensors in many regions of the world and especially the oceans and if we cannot do it now with all our technological advancements, we certainly could not do it in the preindustrial age.  The only fair way to compare that age with our current time would be to only use temperature measurement locations that existed in the preindustrialized time and that still have sensors at the same locations as we do today, then eliminate all locations from both data sets where the location is in a current (or past) heat island, and only use data that was collected at the same Greenwich mean times.  Of course you still have to try to be fair about the start and ending dates to avoid starting or ending on particularly cold or warm years.  Or, rather than drawing a simple trend line, you can graph the results for each year or each season and let everyone see the actual variations from year to year.  This still won't tell us about the actual average global temperature, but it is at least somewhat fair in that it would be a comparison between equivalent data sets.\n\nAs for polar ice, the ice in the Antarctic has been growing for many years and the ice in Greenland has also been growing.  Sea ice is moved around by ocean currents and winds and it's melt rate is affected by ocean temperatures and flow rates, air temperatures and winds, and solar radiance.  How much ice is in the sea is also affected by how much land ice calves off and calving can be increased by warm temperatures but can also be increased by increases in the flow of ice caused by additional snow piling up on land and increasing the pressure on the ice sheet.\n\nClimate alarmists love to take a bit of cherry picked data, predict doom and gloom, scream that we face a terrible problem if we don't fund their research to find a solution to their made up problem, and then fund corporations and/or governments to implement their proposed solution.

First, it assumes that people won't simply use the dividend to pay the higher price for fossil fuels and products, which would mean that fossil fuel production would not be reduced significantly and CO2 emissions would continue to add to the current CO2 levels.  The second flaw is that it does nothing to reduce the current CO2 levels of 400+ ppm down to the historic levels (180-280 ppm).   His solution thus might slow the accumulation of CO2, but doesn't solve the problem.  Instead of a dividend, we should require fossil fuel extractors to recapture the carbon they extract or import every year.  This could be done in gradual increments as he proposes, up to recapturing 110% until CO2 levels fall below 280 ppm, at which point they would only have to recapture 100%.  This is not a tax, but makes the mitigation of pollution a cost of fossil fuel production.  It is really no different than regulations on other types of pollution.

You’d also have to agree the entire country was originally under ice and mans doing did not cause a change at that time. Even if polar ice caps are melting there is still scientific proof other ice caps have grown in size and not to mention the 3 miles of ice that would have to melt in the Antarctic since it’s known it used to be covered in layers of green trees. If CO2 is in an issues and not the green houses gassed of machines, now cows, or even humans at that rate.  Since all humans and living animals expel CO2 gasses then we should look at the natural remedy that utilizes CO2 as fuel. You can’t stop people from reproducing a population. If there’s also more CO2 in the atmosphere then shouldn’t the natural % of gasses change causing a huge catastrophic change since things still have to calculate to 100%. It might not be that we have increased the CO2 levels personally by what we are doing if we go to your statement but rather the Earth is unable to process what once was since we as a civilization are stripping certain resources that clean CO2.

There were droughts and wet periods in the past but the changes that are happening now because of our burning of fossil fuels are dramatic and far more consequential that the changes we saw in the past 1000 years.  For example, humans have increased the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by about 130 ppm in the past 150 years (from 280 ppm in late 1800's to 410 ppm now). During the ice age, CO2 was ~100 ppm less than the 1800's and there was 2 miles of ice above Boston.  The last time (a long time ago) CO2 was TODAY'S value (410 ppm), sea levels were about 75 feet higher than today (it will take a while for that much ice to melt, but that's where we're heading).  We are heading to a completely different climate than the one that civilization developed under... not just a bit wetter or dryer than now.  \n\nThe climate has changed before for natural reasons (over tens of thousands of years, not 150) and 252 million years ago, the temperature increased by +6ºC... and 90% of life on Earth perished.

What bugs me is those who say that weather or weather-related events are 100% totally and completely caused by CO2. Yes, we have put more CO2 into the atmosphere than would be there naturally. Yes, more CO2 does increase the temperature and makes events that are affected by higher temperatures more probable.\n\n\nThe 97% consensus, and I'd expect a larger percentage than that, is on the basic science of greenhouse gases. For each doubling of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the temperature will go up about 1.1C. So purely from CO2, the temperature would only go up by 1.1 C when it gets to 540 ppm. I kind of doubt we'll hit that, but we surely won't hit another doubling, up to 1080 ppm. \n\n\nI'm not sure about the catastrophic predictions. They're using very high numbers for sensitivity multipliers that just don't make sense or that are based on guesses, not science. There is nowhere near consensus on the sensitivity numbers. That's a completely separate theory and one that hasn't held up well. \n\n\nCO2, in and of itself, is a fairly weak greenhouse gas. They're using primarily water vapor for the rest of it. The problem is, we can't model clouds worth beans. Different kinds of clouds, different altitudes, different times, different places. The models are extremely simplistic, and even the IPCC admits that, if you dig into the actual report and not just the summary that's put out for media and politicians.\n\n\nTheir models were trained on the known (well, known but then adjusted to what they think they ought to be) temperatures between about 1950 and 2000. But you can make an equation that exactly matches any data set if you use enough terms. The validation is when the model consistently matches data outside the training period. And they don't. The further you go before 1950 and after 2000, the less the models track the reality. Of course, now they're training them with more years after 2000, but they still don't match the pre-1950 years. If they can't accurately hindcast, then they can't accurately forecast.\n\n\nOn large time scales, you've got plate tectonics. For example, North and South America haven't been joined for that long, geologically speaking. Prior to that, there was a current between them that ran directly between the Pacific and Atlantic. Major climate shift when the Ring of Fire volcanos closed that off. \n\n\n\nThe major changes going every 25,000 years or so at a time have nothing to do with CO2. They are caused by orbital mechanics. How circular the orbit is. How much the spin axis is slanted. Which hemisphere is closest to the sun at perihelion. Look up Milankovich cycles.\r\n\r\nThere was a huge and incredibly fast shift, both down and then up, about 12,000 years ago. Look up the Younger Dryas period for details, but we're talking degrees per decade, or even years. There are two conflicting theories on its cause right now.

If there was a 25% chance that a plane would crash, would you put your child on it?  Of course not.

What they do still lead at is the number of record highs set. It was heat that set in and didn't break for weeks or even months at a time. And of course, the thirty's were cooler than today. But they were a lot warmer, even worldwide, than the temperatures in the 1900s and 1910s. And by about the same amount as we are warmer than the 1970s. And this is before we were putting enough CO2 into the atmosphere to make any difference.\n\n\nI'm not trying to say that global warming isn't real or that our CO2 emissions have warmed the Earth more than it would be without us. That would be denying science. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. The more CO2, the warmer it gets. The question is the multiplier. \n\n\nThat multiplier isn't based on science. It's based on computer models. On what-ifing. On training a huge equation on recorded data and then expecting the projection to match reality. If no one can do that to the stock market (and hundreds, if not thousands have tried), a much simpler system than the climate of a planet, then I have little faith in their models. When those models cannot accurately hindcast data that it hasn't been trained on, I have even less. When scientists can explain the Little Ice Age, both its inception and its end, I might believe more. When scientists can explain the previous peaks of warming, of which I know of at least four (Holocene Maximum, Minoan, Roman, and Medieval), their inceptions and ends, I might believe more. But they can't.\n\n\nYou cannot create jobs simply by saying so. The money to pay for any climate change workers is less money available to pay other workers in actual productive jobs. \n\n\nThe emphasis on wind and solar to the exclusion of any other source is not good. Not by any means. You cannot run an industrial economy without stable electricity 24/7. There is no inexpensive way of storing enough intermittent energy at the scale needed even on paper in other than a few specific places that have the useful geographical features needed. Poorer countries would suffer even more. They can't even build a modern economy at the dual cost of solar/wind and complete backup power. That means leaving hundreds of millions to their suffering and likely bring even more back down into extreme poverty. They need cheap and plentiful power.\n\n\nThere's a pattern I see all too often in both fearful and \"true believers\" people. \"We must do something. This is something. We must do this.\" \n\n\nThe only source I can see for generating power of the kind needed for a modern society that is \"green\" is nuclear. But people have an emotional fear, created by the environmentalists of the 60s and 70s, that a nuclear plant is a bomb waiting to happen. Except it isn't and hasn't. \n\n\nMore people have died installing solar panels than have died from radiation exposure in nuclear power plants (and no, I don't count the two bombs). That includes Chernobyl (unknown exactly, but estimated at less than 200, including those who get and die from thyroid cancer), Three Mile Island (0), and Fukushima (1). Chernobyl was built without even a containment dome. TMI vented a tiny bit, but almost all of it was contained, as designed, inside. Fukushima killed about 1600 people. Not from the plant itself, but in the panic to get away from it. One death has been officially accepted as a direct result of radiation exposure. Fukushima today has less radiation around it than many highly populated places have naturally with no adverse health effects.\n\n\nThere are new reactor designs on the table today that would be far, far safer than anything currently running. China is building a few interesting ones. But the best one seems to be the molten salt Thorium reactors. Unfortunately, the US government has an incredibly antiquated procedure for building even test reactors on anything with a scale over what fits in a lab. Needless to say, that just won't work.\n\n\nTo sum it up, I place little confidence in the computer models, for the reasons listed. I think the push for solar and wind is counterproductive in the long run and, even in many places the short term. I am an engineer who created my own \"energy\" engineering degree way back when no one offered one by doing a dual concurrent major in electrical and mechanical engineering.  My first scientific love was actually nuclear physics. But I wasn't thrilled with the nuclear plant designs of the day.\n\n\nI love the idea of solar and wind *where it makes sense*. Places with no easy connection to a power grid and that don't need a lot of power. People's homes or office buildings in high power cost places where solar or wind on a small scale, that is available consistently, can be economically competitive as long as they still have the grid to fall back on when needed.

Obviously, this varies from country-to-country depending on their potential to generate renewable energy (enough wind?), their wealth, the influence of fossil fuel companies, and political will. For instance, Australia's solar power potential is vast, capable of not only supplying its domestic needs, but has the potential to sell surpluses to its neighbours to the north. This is being stifled by right-wing politicians determined to keep using their large coal reserves. Their majority in parliament is very slim, and the power of environmental parties is increasing.\n\n\nIn New Zealand (where I live), a large % of consumers cannot afford to purchase EVs and green appliances due to their price, even if they are aware of the long-term socio-economic benefits. At this stage, only the upper-middle and upper class can afford to purchase a brand new EV. A newly-introduced gov't scheme penalizing ICE vehicles by increasing their price, while subsidizing the cost of EVs will help, I would also like to see legal restrictions phased in, which would only allow hybrids and/or the most fuel-efficient ICEs to be purchased or to continue to be driven.\nPolls show that a large increase in the sales of EVs would occur if the price was more competitive (I think a recent poll put it around 90%). Sales are increasingly slowly, but the GHG reduction is tiny. When there was last a large spike in the cost of oil, EV sales skyrocketed, but went back to their pitiful numbers once the price fell. A sustained, global oil crisis is perhaps the best single solution to ridding ourselves of most ICEs. \n\n\nReceiving a regular dividend from the gov't that can only be invested in green products/services would allow a lot of people to make the switch from an ICE to an EV. The same goes for appliances like fridges, washing machines, dishwashers, insulation, double-glazing, etc. There was a subsidy here, which has since expired, unfortunately, subsidizing the cost of installing solar panels on houses that was successful. It would be far more effective now, if reintroduced, because the efficiency of solar has increased significantly, while the capital cost has decreased a great deal.  \n\n\nHistory has shown that the public cannot be relied upon to spend their money on products and services that are both good for them and their family, and society as a whole. This includes tax cuts or gov't handouts. How many people would spend their cash dividends on long-haul flights for a vacation instead of upgrading to a green appliance?

{"cid": "Ugx-5D3hr4hcONSAtil4AaABAg", "text": "\"we can stop global warming by taxing it\". That has to be the most bizarre solution ever.\nIf this gentleman did his homework, he would realise several obvious flaws in his theory. First of all, if you tax (which he calls fee) the oil producing industries, they will automatically pass that onto the consumer. Which means higher fuel costs. The tax receipts will only pay for the higher price, not the green cars. Secondly, who is to say that everyone will just spend their extra income on jusr cars, they might increase consumption on all commodities, not just one. In fact, the latter is a far more probable outcome.\n\nThere is a huge amount of tax on fuel already. Think about the time when fuel cost was only a few cents per litre. Fuel is a highly inelastic good, that is why it is so heavily taxed. All the tax goes into the pockets of the government and oil producing industries. So the idea that the consumer will benifits is a fantasy.\n\nThe best way to tackle fuel costs and the environmental impact of greenhouse emissions is not by yet another raid of the pockets of the consumer, its by investing on new technology. We already have a technology that could offset the use of cars, its called trains. They are powered by electricity and they carry a lot of people around which makes them very efficient. Of course wind and solar power are more harmful to the environment than fossil fuel. They require large swathes of wild land to be farmed, destroying wild life habitat and not even providing enough power to meet demand. So we would need to continue using fossil fuel to top up supply. Nuclear power would cut greenhouse emissions immediately, and by supplying the rail industry with such source of electricity we can cut the cost of travelling by rail, and people would automatically switch. High fuel costs already discourage people from using cars. The state only needs to provide an alternative. That is in fact the problem. There is no alternative at the moment.\n\nTrains can go under ground, leaving the surface for people and animals. They use up a fraction of surface space compared to roads. They carry several carriages, making economy of scale an option during peak hours. They run on electricity, which if produced from nuclear power, cuts greenhouse emissions by a significant amount due to the fact that it needs no top up from other sources.\n\nOne thing that will definitely not work, is yet more tax on fuel. People use fuel because they have to, its the only way to get to work.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "TheScienceofnature", "channel": "UCBR0bM4iCnrNCTio_sB_b0A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTAfyGaI8mCphzKpcYlsmvfHvJrDvyygkPy9g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I have some similar ideas but these also attack our national debt and deficit as well as social security which are also on the path to a tipping point.\nHere's an idea, lets impose an environmental impact tax on corporations based on emissions and environmental damage of their products or service. Eliminate all tax subsidies to all energy sources. Use the revenue generated by the environmental impact tax to fund Social Security and Medicare. Add long term care to Medicare. Prorate Social Security and Medicare for non-retired and those not currently on medicare based on the number of quarters contributed. Use peoples current SS & medicare their employers \"contribution\" to fund individual retirement and health care and term life insurance accounts not to be withdrawn until 59.5 years old except in the case of health care, disability, or death. Medicare will make up any medical shortfall for health, disability, or life insurance regardless of age. This approach would work very much like the benefits federal employees and retires are currently receiving but for the whole country and accomplish the following objectives objectives: \r\n1) Reduce or green house emissions and other environmental pollution as much as feasible and economically possible\r\n2) Eliminate or greatly reduce the national deficit a debt\r\n3) Provide capital investment to keep the economy growing. \n4) Redistribute wealth based on consumption, not income.\r\n5) Relieve pressure on the Social Security and Medicare and provide seniors with retirement medical and financial security\r\n6) Provide health care, disability, and life insurance open to all American citizens", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Stuart Hirsch", "channel": "UCQi0FNCoL0SP8XJoF2nI-og", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR_hJdVdd-o25YWjsC0FgJrIptY9B1CcLHoSg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The number of factors that affect climate changes is massive. Oceans, solar effects, clouds etc. To assume any one thing can be used to turn heating on and off is to admit they simply don’t understand the true complexity of our climate systems. That’s why there are 120 systems trying (poorly) to predict what will happen in the next 50 years and not just one. Also remember that the UN is a political body with its own agenda and the IPCC was set up specifically to find and address anthropogenic climate change.

{"cid": "UgwCW3WLUnwt3eweV3d4AaABAg.8wN4Gkm-agl8wOCe4jCCB6", "text": " @Dan Miller  Long post here, but jump to the end for my alternative ideas. At the first logic step of this program yes. A income distribution scheme would create a situation where lower income people would receive something. The problem is the reaction to this adjustment. A carbon tax will, almost by definition, create more expensive energy prices globally under the plan proposed in the video. If energy prices increase, then the standard of living/health of those on the extreme level of poverty goes down.\n     Corporations are not going to make up this dividend, they will find ways out of this and the monies that are collected via this tax will be very vulnerable to centralized corruption and siphoning. \n     For example, the US collects tax revenue each year, that if less than 3% was earmarked for feeding children worldwide, would eliminate 100% of deaths from food insecurity. At the same time, huge sums are paid to farmers in subsidies to NOT grow crops on arable land (to artificially increase food prices in the markets). American women spend more on lipstick averaged annually than they do on immunizing and feeding starving children. \n    I applaud your motivation, and your idealism. But fundamentally if you want to change human carbon production, you have to do it directly, since indirect ways end up having too many adverse effects. \n\n    So what to do? \n\n\n\nRemove the carbon dioxide....\nThe US has over 32 million acres of land and rents many of the forests to loggers. If the US spent part of its military budget planting trees, they would sequester billions and billions of tons per decade. \n   Want to decrease emissions? Cut government use of carbon emitting services. Make all government buildings solar powered, transport government workers via electric busses, make all military bases run on renewables 100% \n\nThe way that I know that a carbon tax will fail, is that the lawmakers are not willing to give up burning, consuming etc. They aren't willing to adopt migrant children, to ride-share, to ride a bike to the capital to live in tiny homes and go vegan.

Simply producing lime (calcium carbonate) can be used to draw out billions of tons in short order. \n        I can think of dozens of synergistic solutions if we want to drop CO2 concentrations. There is one single main thing that I strongly feel is the core of these solutions, and that is an abundant and cheap source of energy. My main point of contention, is that I do not think that manufacturing plastic/mined metal based solar panels and landscape diminating wind turbines, are very good solutions. \nThere are only about 3x10^12 tons of the stuff in the atmosphere all together, and fusion based electrical generation can take a pretty chunk of that out if need be. \n      I will make you a deal. If you can get the representatives, senators and business owners behind carbon tax legislation to sell their large homes, walk to work, and turn down their thermostats to 55 in the DC winters.

Nothing\nin established physics says that can be done, and no published experiment\nanywhere supports the conjecture. Cox completely ignores the work of the\nbrilliant physicist Josef Loschmidt who explained how gravity forms the\ntemperature gradient in the troposphere, not \"back radiation\" from\nso-called \"greenhouse\" gases.

Of course it makes some sense, but the USA decided last year to have an enormous tax cut and to give the proceeds almost exclusively to the wealthiest sections of society, while the enormous cost of this will be borne by the working man and women and the poorest will suffer the most. In such a society, where greed, corruption and mass ignorance dominate the political landscape, how does anyone think that distributing a dividend equally is ever going to make it through the current system of government by plutocracy?\n\nThis proposal also fails to address the reality that a cultural change also needs to take place and that our current economic models need to be altered to dethrone GDP growth as the sole or primary measure of economic success. I don't know whether we have passed too many tipping points already (though this is entirely possible) but I do know that changing people's expectations and aspirations is an enormously difficult thing to do and that the cult of individualistic greed and consumption that is so prevalent in Western societies (and rapidly spreading to non-western societies as well) is utterly incompatible with the absolute necessity for collaborative and collective measure to mitigate the impacts of Climate Change and Global warming that are already well under way and will result in mass starvation and a refugee crisis and unprecedented population movements that will topple all liberal democracies in Europe and Asia within decades unless we take drastic action now. Modern capitalism works on the basis of everlasting economic growth, ever-growing levels of debt and by pushing the externalities off the balance sheet for someone else to pick up. This lunacy cannot be sustained and is going to kill a large proportion of the human race (possibly up to 100%... I don't know) unless we act decisively and rapidly, so I'm not sure that this idea, good as it is, really meets the needs of our dire emergency.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Exiled_Londoner", "channel": "UCRJCJY2dlCV3hiz_7EQmKWg", "votes": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgwrjMNBK4j9vgTDvkc-987dJxjf71Jszp2A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The Ebionites were a new version of the Essenes. The Essenes were a mixture of Judaism and Pythagoreanism. The Pythagoreans were Vegetarian or possibly Pescatarian. I do not reject Paul. I especially love Galations and Romans. I think when Paul speaks about meat eating that he is speaking from his own opinion and not from divine inspiration. John Wesley read Jacob Boehme's works. Boehme promoted Vegetarianism. Boehme also wrote that we ought to sacrifice our inner unclean animals. William Cowherd, who read Swedenborg's works, taught Teetotalerism and Vegetarianism.

In other words, If the population of the Earth (pre-tipping points) had suddenly dropped and then stabilized permanently at  just 1000 Americans, and those 1000 Americans continued to use fossil fuels at their current rates, would those 1000 Americans and their replacements eventually cause global warming, or would the Earth's natural carbon dioxide absorption abilities prevent that from EVER happening?\nIf the latter is true, then those 1000 people and their replacements could continue to use fossil fuels until total depletion occurred without that ever having caused global warming, and therefore neither fossil fuel use alone nor overpopulation alone could be considered be the root cause of global warming. Instead, only [fossil fuel use PLUS overpopulation] (requires both) could be, since if EITHER contributing factor is removed, global warming from fossil fuel use does not occur.\nIf this is true, then focusing on reducing fossil fuel use just misleads the public into thinking that belt-tightening and renewable resources are the way to solve this problem, when focusing on reducing our population would be far more productive, and would collaterally solve many other problems.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Jerry Smith", "channel": "UCMlAzt9DC2jDMLq6ybLSOYA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFKMtQkRg1rIlsOLWoLPix0KKjvElX7zIBow=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In the same action we can eliminate food shortages and provide potable water for millions who now find it almost impossible to acquire. There are currently a few dozen people putting 100% of their efforts into doing just that. The process? Reversal of just 50% of desertification would do that and more. Grass and trees absorb huge quantities of CO2. As we desertify large  swaths of the planet we are in fact commiting suicide. The methods to reverse that desertification differ in small part depending on where on earth you're doing it, but the  differences are minimal. This CAN and IS being done today. But the scale needs to increase dramatically. Everyone on the planet would benefit, INCLUDING the farmers and ranchers who change their methods to fit the \"new way\". Google John D. Liu, ONE of the men doing fantastic work in this regard. There are many more.The country of Jordan has embarked on a program  to reverse desertification and met  great success.Look online for photos from space of the globe taken between the first and current. The images are STARK. And the fix, while not easy is doable and CHEAP. We have been guilty of changing in drastic measure nature's way. When we return to nature's way the grasses,or crops and their root systems allow rain to be absorbed into the ground rather than run off.  Thus water is preserved for the dry years.  That ground cover VASTLY slows evaporation of water. I'm not a scientist or even educated.But the process is understandable by the masses, people just like me whose eyes glaze over when climate science is discussed.

That climate change is caused predominantly or even significantly by the man-made production of carbon dioxide is untrue. To say it is true is unjustified (there is a absence of scientific evidence for this claim) There is no consensus among climate scientists that an increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is largely responsible for climate change, in fact  most climate scientist dispute or outright deny this claimed correlation. \n\n\nScaremongering.\n\n\"A heatwave linked to global warming killed....\"  Yes, the sun plays a part in global warming and also in climate change.\nTourist seeing former islands through a glass bottom boat.

{"cid": "UgxzQzjfcYbszY0eLYF4AaABAg", "text": "This is a tax and taxes do not help solve the problem.  It is an incentive like saying \"We will rob you if you do not SOMEHOW lower your carbon footprint.\"  Money is not the solution.  \n   8 things will help:\n        1.  Solar power for the home and car and power stations will drop the need for fossil fuels to a manageable level.  Every house and business can run on the amount of sun that hit's one half of it's roof.   Tall buildings reap the height of it's walls and can use the panels to block the heat of the sun from coming in without obstructing the view, and in the winter time be raised up a few feet to allow needed heat in.  \n       2  Wind power, it is not merely for the large application but can be adapted for homes as well.  In FLagstaff Arizona the winds pick up to around 40 to 45 mph in the evenings, it is a tremendous amount of energy to gain from.  In the winter the winds are strong in the north where there is less sun.\n   3.  Thorium is a viable replacement for Uranium based Nuclear power and is safer by far.   Power plants produce huge amounts of emissions not to mention heat and other pollutants that start from the gathering of fossil fuels to it's refinement, deliver and consumption, all produce pollution. Finding replacements to power plants is a huge part of the solution. \n        4. Hydroelectric.  5 Geothermal, which can work in hot zones in California as well as Yellowstone Wyoming.  \n     5.  Another means of solar energy is solar collection by means of mirrors to heat salt water to steam.                                 .     6.  Reforestation and saving forests not only help disburse heat but absorb Co2.  \n      7.  Electric cars, trucks, Semis and even passenger planes are now all becoming electric,  Even Buses are going electric.  The main issue for a long time has been the batteries, but really the whole system has improved with more efficient electronic controllers, chargers, and motors and there are yet more things to try to get more mileage from an electric car.  But the batteries have made the largest jump in the last 10 years and are being improved even today with a potential of getting 600 miles on a charge at best to a thousand in the near future.  Tesla is the leading industry in this area and recently purchased the Ulra Capacitor factory... something K I think,  but they have made such improvements as to add significantly to the range of a battery pack.  There are still new milestones being reached every few months so that the current batteries will be out paced by the following year.  All , hopefully will bring the price down .  The upper 20 K is the lower limit to a decent electric today with Tesla's being the mid 30 K range up to 250,000 for the fastest production car in the world.  0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds and close to 600 mile ranges available.  Tesla has also made a large domestic truck and the full size Semi Truck for hauling goods cross country with the same 600 mile range on a single charge.  More and more charging stations are going up all over the world as we speak.\n   There are over a dozen electric plane models flying today, some with over 300 mile ranges but could improve that with solar assist and one of Teslas improved battery packs.  There is also talk of en electric Jet engine .   There is still a need for fossil fuels in some high energy  applications such as  Tanks, fighter jets, massive transport planes and vehicles, air craft carriers and the like, though some are going nuclear.\n     8.  Recyling.  Plastics mostly.  With what I throw away in 2 liter bottles every year I could build a shed out of it.  It could be melted down and extruded into 2, 3, and 4 inch clear tubing strong enough to build with.  Or square pipe stock for more practical construction.  Metal, paper and Glass are others that are getting recycled but not on a grand enough scale.

The air that comes in the front of the engine is all pushed out the back at a higher speed (which is what propels the plane).  Fossil fuels are burned to turn the turbine that pushes the air (and CO2 is released in the process).

If I make a statement and you have the ability to quickly verify that which I state, which I'm sure you should have, then why do you require that I attempt to find all the sources I have read over the years? If I did so, you state you would check the primary source. So if you can gain information so easily why not do so anyway irrespective as to whether I have sent my sources or not. I'm sure you would not trust my sources anyway and would engage with others. So my question to you is why not short cut the long winded process of me having to search for them again and just make verifications as you would do in any case.

I've been arguing this on the internet since the mid-2000s and actually created a thread that went over 6,000 posts at one point. I don't need to argue this anymore because events have proven my position to be correct. The amount of evidence that's come out since 2010 is staggering. You can even say the science has been settled. Climate change is real and it's been happening since the dawn of time. Sadly a lot of young people that don't realize that things go in Cycles seem to think that the current cycle is the end. It's not. It's a cycle. So you continue going on believing whatever you want to believe and who you want to believe I prefer to trust the data. Anyone who actually looks at the date of themself without trusting the interpretations of others realizes what a farce the entire agw religion is all about. Here's a fun one for you\n\nWhenever your local weatherman says that today is the hottest day in over a hundred yearsoh, don't say to yourself oh my God the planet is burning up. Brother ask yourself, how hot was it back then. There is a reason Greenland is called Greenland. And there is a reason why the United States had the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. And there is a reason why we were scared to death of global warming in the thirties but then we were scared to death of global cooling in the seventies and then in the early 2000s we were scared of global warming again. It's cyclical.\nAnd here's another real challenge for everyone. Risk analysis as part of my job. There are three factors to consider. First is the likelihood of a thing happening. Second is the impact of a thing happening. And third is the cost of mitigating the risk. This is why we don't Harden our houses against a meteor strike. The results would be catastrophic. But the cost of mitigation would also be catastrophic. We wouldn't have enough money left over to feed ourselves. The same issue is at play with the agw religion. The risk of all the bad stuff happening gets smaller and smaller as predictions failed to come true. But the cost is astronomical.\n\nEspecially in third world countries that are trying to become second world countries.\n\nAnd here is the big points. At the end of the day this is about control. If you can convince the general public that carbon dioxide is actually a poisonous gas to the planet, and get them to an able you to control the production of carbon dioxide, you have caused them to allow you to control every aspect of human life. The reason is simple. Virtually everything people do results in some amount of carbon dioxide. Don't be fooled, this is an attempt to totally control the entire Human Race by convincing us that carbon dioxide is a pollutant. Do you want to know what warms our planet? Atmospheric pressure. That's why Mars and Venus, both of which have the same percentage of carbon dioxide in their atmospheres, have such wildly different temperatures. And why the temperature at the lowest reaches of Jupiter's atmosphere are so incredibly hot even though it's so far from the sun. It's why the Grand Canyon is so much harder at the base then it is up at the top. It's why mountain tops are so cold even though they have so much direct sunlight.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Rob Wells", "channel": "UCS0RJzz88eKNLiR6WE21Qvw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSUzfjGRq342yt5oV0W-zBrCJ8IpyBFQEa9yLj6FA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And if you look at the global climate as best as we can tell from what sources we have over the last 10000 years you can see that we are actually not in our warmest. And are Justin and yet another cycle. And we've been in a pause for a long time. This entire Century has not been warming it's been flat and possibly even Cooling. Why do you think we're having these cold snaps every winter? That's just a part of it. And remember, Al Gore said that we wouldn't have an ice cap by 10 years ago and yet nothing changed.

His sea level rise numbers are based upon the''solid Earth'' paradigm.  In fact, the Earth is more accurately a liquid filled balloon-like body.

If we expanded/accelerated that effort through investment in  desalination,  we could increase carbon capture by a big percentage. \n\n\nAlso, there has been talk of seeding the ocean surfaces with iron compounds - to promote the growth of algae.

{"cid": "UgxPZ5CQ9rqKV40Ml614AaABAg", "text": "CO2 has no effect on temperature.  Convection and conduction from the ground vs radiation that extinguishes in 40 feet makes NO difference in total heat.  Sorry the theory is 100% wrong.  The absorption of CO2 is 10 months if you do a Fourier analysis of Mauna Loa Data.  Most estimates are less than 10 years, average is 5.  CO2 is all gone in worst case in 10 years from man.  The reason it is goes up has nothing to do with man.  It is a function of Ocean Water temperature.  Simple chemistry.  Stomata data from plants shows 400 ppm is common and it goes up and down in cycles of 60-80 years.  We are nearing the end of a cycle.  Ice core data is not correct at 280 ppm.  \n\nPutting a price on CO2 (\"carbon\") will actually delay real solutions.  My engine can get you 4x less fuel per distance than an old car.  It is also less CO2 than an EV while using gasoline.  To get to zero CO2 you need nuclear and electro-fuels, fuels made from electricity.  If you want Jet fuel, you need a supply of CO2, which can be found in Ocean Water.  The Navy will be making jet fuel on aircraft carrier soon.  If you want NH3 (ammonia) you have N2 in the air (78%), which you can make via solar from home.  Either fuel would run the world.  Put nuclear on coast and make Jet fuel (can be used in Diesel engines) or make NH3 inland at home with my new engine.  \n\nWe need eletro-fuels for products to replace oil.  This is a key technology that is required to get to zero new CO2.  Batteries will not help or lower CO2 output.  Plug to wheel for my engine in car vs Electric Vehicle is less via NH3 than with battery.  NH3 can store 12,000 Kwh in a 1000 gallon tank that costs $1500, vs a L-ion battery at $2.4 million.  A 1600 times cost multiple.  NH3 IS the battery.  Fuel IS the battery.  Just make it via nuclear and you have zero CO2.  \n\nBut again, CO2 is entirely beneficial and more is better.  1200 ppm is much better for earth than 400.  The reason to go nuclear and electro-fuel without batteries (toxic nightmare in the future) is to allow low cost energy for all.  If all the world wanted oil based energy we would have oil at $200/barrel and high fuel costs.  Batteries can't work in airplanes due to weight.  NH3 and Jet fuel can.  \n\nProblem is rather easy to solve.  Nuclear + my engine + electro fuels.   This video has no solution and is totally wrong about CO2.

Except this time do it like this: \n\n\n\nStart with Hwys.  Reduce the 100 kph speed to 90.  On an hourly basis, all else like gearing equal, you reduce fuel consumption 19%.  Now you go less far per hour at 90, but you only have so much time, so it isn't quite 19%.  What is different this time is you make it voluntary.  You can buy a license that only allows you to do 90, an eco license.  You can still drive 100, but you don't get the license. Funnily enough, I base this idea on the conservation fishing license that only allows you to catch so many fish, or keep so many fish.\n\n\n\nIn Toronto where I live a lot of people vote for climate change parties like the Lib., but a ton drive 120 rather than 100.  That takes 44% more gas.  But they still get to go to cocktail parties and talk up their virtue.  Well if you pull up in a regular license, good luck with that.\n\n\nThere are other advantages:\n\n\n1) Rich people do not care about extra fuel costs, this puts everyone on an equal footing;\n2) There is a lot more pollution than just co2 coming out of your tailpipe, cutting that back helps a lot also;\n3) The eco license should be cheaper, because it is good, but also because you will tear up roads to similar lessor degrees. That 44% more gas you burn to do 120, rather than 100 is 44% more impact energy, and moment of compliance as you flex roads, and hit minor and major ripples in the road;\n4) You also hit with 44% more energy when you have a crash at 120, rather than 100 KPH. \n\nAnd there are more reasons, and ideas related to this proposal, but this is enough for now.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Hondo Trailside", "channel": "UCg-niG8r5iBjMLJtgnvNGTg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR5P1L2zfChmYsHOlOYHia4agqyXBtCdVubdw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Would you consider that a good thing?  Yes, more CO2 -- everything else left unchanged -- helps plants grow, but more CO2 (less than 1600 ppm) warmed the world 252 million years ago to +6ºC and 90% of life on Earth perished.  That warming took tens of thousands of years to happen.  We are doing it in 100 to 200 years.  How much CO2 is OK?

Consumers can switch away from fossil fuels for their car but that just means the problem is returned to the electric production plant since the majority of our electricity continues to come from fossil fuels. The carbon idea  has been studied extensively, including foreign attempts to implement it, but it hasn't even come close to working well anywhere. Consumers can  switch to wind or solar, but since these energy forms are intermittent, they must have extensive standby capacity particularly in the areas where most Americans actually live.  Usually this standby capacity will be natural gas fired, but natural gas is 90% as bad as coal.

But that doesn't make them more efficient, since ic's get a far higher ratio of energy inputs converted to energy outputs. Your views on  the cost of wind and solar are also incorrect since they don't reflect  true costs. In addition to the high costs of maintaining separate generation facilities to compensate for their intermittent periods, the nation would have to buy storage facilities roughly equivalent to one house on every block in the land -- empty it of family and replace it with batteries. Also note that the existing grid supplies electricity made from fossil fuels with natural gas being the worst offender. There is no point in converting the car fleet to electric vehicles until the grid is ready. Finally while we both agree electric vehicles are a very good thing, the even bigger problem is to get rid of fossil fuels in the industrial, commercial, and utility stationary source markets. This requires a huge investment and it would ruin the amelioration if a giant slug of it were invested in wind and solar since the money would have to ultimately be spent on something that solved the problem.  Please think all these things through.

He says the 400 PPM level is causing climate change.  The goal would be to reduce it to early 1800's levels, call it 200 PPM, where it is believed the climate will stay normal.  The problem he doesn't mention is reduction of CO2 input to the atmosphere will not stop or even reduce climate change until the level is below a certain PPM limit, to be determined, but let's say it has to be 200 PPM.  Even total cessation of man-made CO2 will not lower PPM levels rapidly enough to prevent severe climate change, this is called the passive approach.  From a standing start, it will take nature over 100 years to reduce the excess level by HALF, 400 years to reduce it to early 1800's levels.  And of course the whole world economy will crash to a halt and billions will die of starvation, disease and chaos.  What to do?  Instead of passively reducing CO2, ACTIVELY reduce it !!!!!  Nature removes CO2 all the time and puts it into the ground using TREES, trillions and trillions of trees.  We should stop cutting down all trees.  We should plant MORE trees anywhere we can.

We can also pull CO2 out of the air the way it's done inside nuclear submarines with CO2 scrubbers.

What about the poorest who don't even have electricity and lighting because that would be contributing to climate change? Who controls the taxation? Follow the money. \n\nAnd second, climate change is the most important problem humanity faces because all other problems pale in comparison. Poverty, epidemics, hunger, toxic pollution, poisoned food and water, constant wars on terror with unfortunate collateral damage, global thermonuclear war and radiation, chronic underemployment and dissatisfying jobs, artificial intelligence, electronic surveillance, suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic and gang violence, police brutality, unbridled greed, extreme wealth imbalance, gradual loss of rights, widespread corruption.

In this regard, it is important to remember the history of taxes collected by governments as a breeding ground for corruption, greed and subsequent failure. Therefore - we are screwed without a proper mission statement that outlines the human purpose in the symbiotic relationship and balance of our living planet. I advocate for a planetary \"mission statement\" that is defined  with reverence for the \"magic and wonder of all life\" that carefully maintains  humility for the human experience in the process. While we define what love and empathy is for \"the beautiful thing\" called life. We are about 2 million years away from achieving that observational Karma with the universe and it looks to me like the first step toward this noble mission took us about 70,000 years and  is full of agony and suffering with accasional notable moments of artistic merit by the great profits we sacrificed for man made institutions operated by the few that are threatening us all.

The more machine that have been made over the past 30 years, the weaker the earths field has got. So to stop the atmosphere heating up we have to decrease the amount of magnetic’s we use.

You made a biiiig assumption that I don’t disagree with the policy, anytime someone has an idea that gives the government more money and another reason to get bigger, I have problems!\nYou say the government will absorb the costs involved with implementing this program, where will that money come from? The government does not have their own $$ only what the taxpayers give them so that $$ comes from US.\nYou say everyone gets a check (and thank you for adding LEGAL citizens!) will that include those that don’t own homes or cars? People in apartments, condos, elderly housing, dorms, etc. will not be able to put solar panels on the roof and will only need a few LED bulbs. I know a lot of elderly people that either don’t own cars or don’t drive very much so their checks are going to be spent at the casino. Do you think the 21 year old in college will be buying LED bulbs? Perhaps  the first month but then what? Beer?  More than likely. I say this somewhat tongue in cheek but you KNOW some of the money, possibly a lot of the money, is going to be spent foolishly. I can see a large portion of the money being used to pay bills, fix the broken fence, buy the kids school clothes, etc. It will help people, I just wonder how much it will help the planet.\nYou go on to add that big corporations will be paying heavily into the system but will not receive a check. Do you really think that the likes of the Walton’s will see their delivery costs go up without making some sort of correction at the register? Your figure of ten cents a gallon works out to be roughly 3%, I can’t imagine a huge corporation like Walmart not correcting for a 3% increase in delivery costs. Do you suppose that correction will be just the 3% or will companies add another percentage point or two just to be on the safe side? Now everyone is paying more for EVERYTHING and that will be money that does not make it into this system.\nHow much do you think we will get every month? Even if it’s a check for $1000 will that make Bill Gates buy solar panels? I would expect that people with his financial horsepower would have already made the changes you propose if they really wanted to, a miniscule check every month is not going to sway them.

So, while fossil fuels are \"cheap\", they are actually one of the most expensive forms of energy.  These external costs are real and must be paid through higher insurance premiums, uninsured losses, food prices, health care costs, and taxes (to pay extreme weather events, droughts, floods, etc).  Because of this mispricing of fossil fuels, our economy runs less efficiently and that reduces jobs and incomes for most Americans. \n\nFee and Dividend helps correct this mispricing and makes the price of fossil fuels more closely match the cost of using such fuels.  By raising the price of fossil fuels, clean alternatives such as wind and solar will be more competitive and will be selected by utilities (and corporations such as Walmart) more often as they phase out \"expensive\" fossil fuels.  A price on the carbon content of fossil fuels will also make new technologies such as carbon capture commercially feasible.\n\nSo, the success of Fee and Dividend does not depend on people spending their dividend checks on \"green\" things, though many will because it will save them money!\n\nOn a side note, you should reconsider your fear of government spending.  States that tax and spend more (like California) have better economies and incomes than states that have lower taxes and spending.  The experiment has been done and the results are clear.  This effect is also true on the country level.  The highest taxed countries (e.g., Scandinavian countries) have great economies and their citizens are \"happier\" than those in lower taxed countries. But in any case, Fee and Dividend does not provide any money to the government and, as you point out, it costs the government a little bit to run the program.  The good news is that the extra taxes collected because of Fee and Dividend's positive impact on GDP (growing it by $1.4 trillion over 20 years) will more than pay for the small cost to run the program.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Dan Miller", "channel": "UCbdIaDyU6_AdlDQqb43rDWA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQHJa6u0r5kkJyAVz85wMJUU3tJpsv_xGpSX_rB=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Even the new Pope won't admit that people cause global warming and won't declare that birth (population) control is not a sin. The Catholic church is a business just like carbon-based businesses, they both need customers.  Do you really believe that they will willingly change decades or centuries old policy  based on your very flawed economic model.  Economics is not a science so you are deceiving us and yourself citing numbers for  jobs created, economic growth,  dividends, and timelines. Your numbers are not based on anything other than wishful thinking because you cannot possibly predict what people will do with their dividend.  Humans are selfish and greedy (look at your own life Mr Miller, making money you did not need) and not willing to make any personal sacrifice that affects their standard of living. I think most people will use the dividend for things other than energy efficiency - like essentials or toys.  Even if humans were not shortsighted, selfish, greedy, etc., there are still well over 50% of the population who do not believe global warming is real or a problem. This is because our media and our goverment are run by the greedy  corporations and politicians who feed us lies and propaganda to keep us under the delusion there is nothing to worry about.  I thank you for your effort Mr. Miller, but spend your time to write an apology to your grandchilren for what we have done and accept your and their fate, our species is doomed.  We are at a more seroius tipping point than you mentioned. Within 20 years we will experience a runaway positive feedback loop.  Hotter temps will cause release methane from permafrost and from bottom of the ocean where it has been sequestered with the help if cold temp. Methane is 30 times worse than CO2.

{"cid": "Uggxjh7biOwuxngCoAEC.8Ml2tifCugj8NQiymnLVQO", "text": "Bertie:  Responses to your questions/comments:\n\nQ: When you say rapidly warming are you suggesting the rate is unprecedented and is therefore only attributable to man made co2?\n\nA: There have been rapid increases in temperatures in the distant past, but you imply by your question that if it happened naturally in the past, it can't be caused by man now.  That's not true.  There were wildfires before man walked the Earth.  That does not mean that people can't cause wildfires.  In fact, we know by many lines of evidence that man is causing the current warming.  One of the simpler lines of evidence is we know quite accurately how much fossil fuel we burn each year and, therefore, how much CO2 we put in the atmosphere (about 30~40 gigatons/year).  Since we have been studying greenhouse gases since the 1800's, we know how much warming the manmade greenhouse gases should cause and it matches what we see.\n\nQ: Is it your contention there has not been a pause and co2 has risen in linear fashion to temp since the mid 1800s?.\n\nA:  At the beginning of the industrial revolution, the smoke from fossil fuel burning caused more cooling than the CO2 caused warming and there was some cooling in the early part of the 20th century.  Re-industrialization after WW2 caused another dip, but by the 1970's, the warming effect took over and the warming has been steady since then, with natural fluctuations on a yearly basis.  But if you look at the average global temperature per decade, it has gone up steadily since the 1970's.  Remember that climate is the long-term average of weather (usually averaged over 30 years) and the 30-year temperature average has been steadily rising (though it's not \"linear\" and no one says it should be linear).  Note that the coal smoke that cools the Earth lasts in the atmosphere for a few weeks.  The CO2 that causes warming lasts in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years.\n\nQ: If you disagree with the 0.8c rise you disagree  with NASA/GISS this is their published estimate - please  focus.\n\nA:  It was 0.8ºC a few years ago, but the global temperature has risen dramatically in the past 3 years (2014, 2015, and 2016 were all record years... I believe that is the first time there was 3 record years in a row).  2016 was about +1.2ºC above pre-industrial temperatures and February 2016 was +1.5ºC above pre-industrial.\n\nQ: Why are you surprised ice is melting given it's been happening for milennia. Do you think it hasn't happened before?\n\nA:  Why is the ice melting now?  The Sun's output is at low for the century.  The ice should be growing as we enter the next ice age period.  We know why there were ice ages and interglacial periods in the recent (last 800,000 years) past and why there were much warmer periods before that (due to orbital shifts and massive, long-term volcanic activity and continental shifts -- but that's not happening now).  The last time the Earth had 400ppm CO2 in the atmosphere, sea levels were 75 feet higher than today... that's where we are heading (and more) and it's manmade this time.\n\nQ: 8000 bc a period known as the “early Holocene insolation maximum” (EHIM) had just such an event.\n\nA: There were significant climate shifts as we transitioned to the inter-glacial period.  But civilization flourished under a remarkably stable climate in the past several thousand years.  It's getting unstable now and it won't be pretty.\n\nThe bottom line to most of your arguments is the fact that the climate has changed naturally in the past does not contradict in any way the fact that we know that man is causing the current warming.  There is overwhelming scientific evidence of manmade climate change which you choose to ignore and/or you believe that there is a vast conspiracy by scientists to fool everyone.

So, when it comes to global warming, about the only thing that matters long-term is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which has been steadily rising since the industrial revolution.  On top of the global warming \"signal\" is layered fluctuations from natural sources, (e.g., El Nino, La Nina, volcanoes, solar cycles, orbital cycles, etc.) and unnatural sources (manmade aerosols, e.g., coal smoke).\n\nSo, it doesn't matter that there was coal usage a long time ago.  The amount was small and it didn't effect the atmospheric CO2 concentration much (which was about 280ppm before the industrial revolution).\n\nWhy do you think coal smoke cooling the Earth defies basic reasoning?  Natural clouds have a high albedo (reflectivity) and reflect sunlight away from the Earth, which cools the Earth.  Coal smoke also has a high albedo and, from space, looks much like natural clouds.  Why then would it not reflect sunlight and cool the Earth?  Please explain.\n\nAs for \"Rates of temp increase\":  What's your point?  The temperature has generally been going up since the beginning of the 20th century, but in the first half of the 20th century, the fluctuation \"noise\" was larger than the global warming \"signal\".  It is certainly not surprising that you can find periods before 1970 where the RATE of temperature increase is similar to the RATE after 1970.  But the actual temperatures are higher in the 1970s-1990s than in the past.  So what's your point?  Just look at the graph of global temperatures:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_record#/media/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg\n\nI think almost everyone looking at the graph, including you, would agree that global average temperatures has been rising fairly steadily since the 1970s.  That's what matters.  If you want to argue that the temperature rise since the 1970s is not due to manmade emissions of greenhouse gases (and manmade land use changes), then please explain why the manmade GREENHOUSE gas emissions don't matter and explain what other forces are increasing global temperatures.

In this book, Dr. Singer explores the inaccuracies in historical climate data, the limitations of attempting to model climate on computers, solar variability and its impact on climate, the effects of clouds, ocean currents, and sea levels on global climate, and factors that could mitigate any human impacts on world climate.\n\nSinger’s masterful analysis decisively shows that the pessimistic, and often alarming, global warming scenarios depicted in the media have no scientific basis. In fact, he finds that many aspects of any global warming, such as a longer growing season for food and a reduced need to use fossil fuels for heating, would actually have a positive impact on the human race. Further, Singer notes how many proposed “solutions” to the global warming “crisis” (like “carbon” taxes) would have severe consequences for economically disadvantaged groups and nations.\n\nHot Talk, Cold Science is essential reading for anyone who wants to be fully informed about the global warming debate.\n\nThis debate is not settled has people like Dan Miller would like you to believe.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Jim and Colleen Chmelik", "channel": "UC0n_MT6sE0Ut_FuQwavTBQQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTDiVk78ZqAbFJnnItmYPstWR7Rwd8w6b5dxQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Second I think humans ARE acting rationally in taking no action given what we see around us: namely, the vast vast majority getting on which capitalist consumption as usual, even while a few people warn of a terrible danger (and, worse, sometimes these two groups overlap).

The Little Ice Age was anomalously cold compared to other intra-warm periods. In fact, the last 3 warm periods show a strong downtrend (GISP2 ice core proxies). This suggests that the Holocene may be winding down.\n\nAnd Ice Age? We already live in an Ice Age as defined by those 2 little white things persisting at the poles (Greenland and Antarctica). Climate changes on a far shorter time scale. Climate is changing right now and has for the last several billion years. At the start of the Holocene (end of the Younger Dryas), global average temperatures rose +5C in 50 years, far faster than our current \"frightening\" change. That Global Warming made civilization possible.

Plants freaked out and evolved C4 species to cope with the CO2 starvation. Let that fact sink in for a few weeks. Human production of extra CO2 is greening the Earth.

The argument and the evidence was further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838, and reasoned from experimental observations by John Tyndall in 1859.[12] The effect was more fully quantified by Svante Arrhenius in 1896.[13] However, the term \"greenhouse\" wasn't used to describe the effect by any of these scientists; the term was first used in this way by Nils Gustaf Ekholm in 1901.[14][15]  In 1917 Alexander Graham Bell wrote \"[The unchecked burning of fossil fuels] would have a sort of greenhouse effect\", and \"The net result is the greenhouse becomes a sort of hot-house.\"[16][17] Bell went on to also advocate the use of alternate energy sources, such as solar energy.[18]<<\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect#History\nThis short history shows that any 'conspiracy' Deniers believe in must span nearly 2 centuries.

This is why Venus, the second planet, is so hot.\n\nAlso, the reason the term 'global warming' has been mostly replaced with 'climate change' is because scientists have noted over the years, that the rise in earth's temperature results in more fluctuations in weather, rather than just heating up. This is why the ice caps are melting, but the east coast experienced the worst snow it's ever gotten two years ago.\n\n\nAnd, yes, our planet naturally has cycles of hotter and colder weather ex: the ice age vs. prehistoric eras.

This is the fastest rapid and exponential increase in greenhouse gasses the world has ever been through-and is linked directly to the rise in CO2 emissions.\n\nI understand where your questioning is coming from, and I'm glad you at least pay attention to what's going on with the 'climate crisis'. \n\nI hope this answered your question :)", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Eliza Luker", "channel": "UC93TyLiUwWGlRLF9WTr2s4w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRz39g9gF6n1Au1anzRWp_tEc2hMDJTAJ_2uRhzPw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It strangles the economy, just like a record high wage tax has the Industry moving away from Sweden ever since 1980. A marginal tax of 80 %, a sales tax of 25 % and a 300 % tax on gas. It works to lower emissions, but it destroys every other development. The domestic demographic ( excluding war refugees ) has been sharply negative in Sweden, ever since the high tax regime in the 70's. The taxes have never been corrected, even if there isn't any growth in Scandinavia like there was in the 80's. No matter how many Companies that leave Sweden, like Volvo, Ericsson, and new ones like Minecraft and other game developers + thousands of shell Companies, the Government never changes. The conclusion is. The Swedish Government ( and large parts of Europe ) will never have my trust, when it comes to \"economical oversight\". The economy is a disaster. On top of that there is no minimum wage or any set levels for social security. I have been working here at wages around 10 dollars per hour but also at 3 dollars per hour for several years, and the food here is 50 % more expensive. A poor citizen has to bargain with the social service, on an ongoing basis and some people play the game very well, while others rather sleep in a tent because they are sick of all the corruption. This is not a humane Society. I mean. I don't need ( or want ) a car, at this moment. But there are major issues behind all of this, which makes owning anything a pain. It's not even worth it, to try for a material standard in this system. In Sweden you will just work your ass off, and in the end, it will be for nothing. Good for the environment ? Yes. A good place to live ? If your not working for the Government ( or a large Company that adheres to the system ) then no. This system is not sustainable. A majority of my friends are so pissed off at the system, that the environment is the last thing on their mind. People litter all over, because they see it like spitting on the Governmental system.

Zero Carbon is not going to happen for many decades, if at all.\n\nHowever we could start removing atmospheric CO2 albeit at very small volumes, initially. Most commentators are fixed on the sudden (& un-achievable) removal of fossil fuels when what the entire planet needs to understand and act on is including the cost of pollution into the price of the product. For example: Factor in an estimate of removing the pollution from burning 1 litre of petrol in your car (say $30) and petrol is no longer cheap. Do the same for coal used in a power station and coal becomes hugely expensive; more so than Nuclear power which has no global warming attributes.\n\nOur so-called energy policies have been founded on the (misunderstood) apparently low cost of fossil fuels. Which means these policies are fundamentally flawed because you cannot compare use of fossil fuels with no pollution cost, with nuclear or renewables; they are not even apples and oranges, more like a swede and a strawberry!\n\nBut sadly that is what economists and policy makers have been doing and continue to do....\n\nThe problem is one of education and policy. Economists must stop avoiding pollution costs and policy-makers need to introduce legislation that requires all fossil fuel suppliers and large polluting industries to factor in the actual cost of pollution remediation and then undertake said remediation.\n\nIf you work for an oil & gas company you might want to alert senior managers to the possibility of diversifying into pollution remediation so that your reserves can be monetized without damaging the planet; or go out of business in the next couple of decades.\n\nAll too expensive you say. Indeed and that is the real cost of using fossil fuels that we have avoided so far.\n\nWe cannot avoid them much longer.\n\nThe good news about properly understanding the cost of pollution and factoring it into energy sources is that a parallel industry; let's call it the fossil-fuel sewerage business is required in order to undertake pollution remediation. This requires capital, technology and staff, all of which is good for global economic growth. Gradually build up remediation capacity; a good place could be Saudi Arabia using solar power to run large scale atmospheric CO2 removal.\n\nDepending on the volume & rate of remediation we may be able to continue using fossil fuels without pushing the mean global temperature beyond a critical limit.\n\nSo there you are; a simple solution to fossil fuel derived global warming using basic economics and the equivalent of the sewerage industry that became established in the 19th Century when we realised that defecating in our own back yard wasn't very smart.\n\nSee Facebook Group: Environmental Energy", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Jeremy Daines", "channel": "UCLnTr-8WcSnnWbqnDPU3EcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSOy4plTDSUj_AULDrRlGC3tcgu0o_vuA1nb5LC=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Besides $30/MTCO2e being far too low a price signal and far less than the actual social costs of $100-500/MTCO2e, consumers count only 2-3 years of operating costs when buying a vehicle or appliance. A new vehicle or house or appliance will consume fossil fuels throughout its useful life, and thus the decision point with by the most leverage is the purchase of new infrastructure. At that point the sticker should list the actual social cost of the purchase decision (the social costs for the full lifetime of the product), and the fee or rebate necessary for a strong price signal would be much less than that social cost. \nA fee on emissions (assuming we don't refund it back to everyone) can affect behaviors like driving less or slower or carpooling to save fuel, but better behaviors with dirty infrastructure will get us only ~20% of the way to zero emissions.

By 2027 we’d have a $100/MTCO2e fee on emissions or about a dollar per gallon of gasoline; thus gasoline would still be cheaper than in 2014. (Global markets will probably still be awash in oil, due to transportation electrification.) When buying a new car, consumers will see gas as cheaper than when he/she afforded it in 2014. Where is the incentive to drive less than they did in 2014, and where is the incentive to buy a more efficient car?\n\n“…power plant developers, companies, and individuals start planning right away for the higher fee.” They will plan for oil prices being a little higher, but still lower than in 2104. Why would they change anything re oil consumption? If it made no sense to change at $4/gallon, then it makes even less sense to change at $3.50. \n\nWorse than way too low a price signal and way too late, returning the money to the public negates most of the incentive to change. An average consumer will be pissed to find that oil companies simply passed the fee onto consumers and utilities simply passed the fee onto ratepayers, etc. Then he’ll be relieved that he gets it all back, but Republicans will be pissed because all it did was redistribute income with a lot of government overhead. Where are the implementations of fee and dividend systems that demonstrate emission reductions?\n\nAnd way before we got to $100/ton, companies would be demanding border carbon adjustments on exports and imports to keep costs fair. That would be a very complex, challenging, and expensive system.\n\nIn the vehicle feebate scenario, a new vehicle within a class is charged a fee if it is lower efficiency than the target efficiency or receive a rebate if it is higher than the target. Typical auto lifetime is 150,000 miles, so a 20 mpg car will use 7500 gallons of fuel. At $100/ton and 22 lb/gal, the lifetime social cost of emissions is $7500. Even a fraction of that $7500 would slow down sales significantly and make a nice rebate for a zero-emission vehicle.

I'm a bit nervous to confront you with quotes from that discussion, because I myself said some things then that I'm embarrassed about now. (For what it's worth, I was 21.) However, at the time, you said, \"extreme events (3-sigma) are now happening 25 to 50 times more often than just 50 years ago.\" I thought that was clearly wrong, so I asked you if you stood by it after giving it some thought, and you said you did, and then elaborated: \"When Extremely Hot Days are happening over 10% of the land area instead of 0.2% of the land area, they are happening 50 times more often in individual places... which is what matters.\"\n\nNow, I'm happy to see that you made no reference in this TEDx talk to \"extreme events,\" heat waves, or anything else becoming 25 to 50 times more frequent over the past several decades. In fact, you didn't mention any documented increase in extreme weather of any kind. Surely, if you still stood by the claim that any kind of extreme weather has become 25 to 50 times more frequent, in any meaningful sense, you would have included it in your talk. After all, it's an incredibly alarming claim. So, did you leave it out because you've lost confidence in it?

They are 'mechanical' resonances, due to the very many modes of virbration of the molecules - both water and carbon dioxide being made up of a central atom with two outriders, either in a linear non-polar molecule (CO2), or a 'bent' and assymetric (and polar) molecule (H2O). These molecules absorb infrared energy at many frequencies and then reemit it. Water molcules also have dozens of resonances in the same general region of the spectrum, but these rarely exactly coincide precisely with CO2 absorption/emmision lines. You might think at first these two processes would not interact very much, only where the molecules had the same resonance frequency. However, all of these molecules are moving, at considerable speed, over a wide range of speeds, and the effect of this, due to the doppler effect, is that from the point of view of a receiving molecule, the emission can appear to the receiving molecule to be at the right frequency to be absorbed, depending on its relative motion - another way to look at this is to view it as the the spectral lines being broadened, and the degree of broadening depends on the speeds of the molecules, and hence on the temperature. This boadening is easily measured. This behaviour is what makes the calculation of the degree of interaction of the two gases very complicated - but experimentally, it's much easier to demonstrate and measure, and the degree of interaction for further calculation is approximated at each temperature. There's no end of evidence this happens, going back a hundred years.\nYou don't know any science.

It is no trouble at all to demonstrate that incoming radiation is partially absorbed by the atmosphere and reemitted in all directions, so that some then leaves the atmosphere, reemitted to space. The remainder travels on through the atmosphere being absorbed and reemitted, mostly elastically (though there is some direct heating), some always backscattered, until it reaches the surface. The surface warms, and radiates a very broad range of wavelengths upwards. It is the infrared component of this radiation that interacts with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and here, backscatter occurs in just the same way as before. But in this case, the backscatter has a significant component towards the earth, i.e. the CO2 and interacting H20 constitute an impedance to heat leaving the atmosphere for space. This is the greenhouse effect, and it is very easily demonstrated. It is no trouble to demonstate and measure if you have the right facilities, and it is easy to show that a tank of air above an absorbing base, with added CO2, absorbs a certain proportion of downwards incident radiation (characterised by the increase in temperature of the gas in the tank), that changing the CO2 for water vapour absorbs a different amount, producing a different temperature, and that in the presence of both gases, the temperature increases by more than the sum of the separate effects of the two.

There is no proof in science, only in mathematics.  We understand climate change about as well as we understand gravity.  Not the details like where the next storm will hit, but we know that adding CO2 to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels will raise global temperatures, raise sea levels, etc.  Science has known this since the 1800's.  To be more specific, every major scientific academy in the world -- without exception -- says global warming is real, is mostly caused by humans, and requires urgent action:\nhttp://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf\n\n\n\n2.  Climate change is a one-way street.  Whatever temperature we hit when we finally stop emitting greenhouse gases (GHGs) is the temperature we will be stuck with for the next 1000 years.  So if we follow your advice and climate change turns out to be a big problem like most scientists say, then all future generations are screwed.\n\n\n3.  I do believe that most climate scientists are wrong to some degree.  It turns out that they are probably playing down the risks of climate change and the urgency of the need to lower GHGs.  After all, they're human and they know people don't want to hear bad news.  If you want to argue that climate change won't be as bad as most scientists say, then you must also accept that it could be worse than they say.  For a number of reasons, the chances of the later is higher than the former.\n\n\n4.  I do believe that the Russian heatwave was directly linked to global warming for the reasons I stated (Hansen's paper).  But I acknowledge that in this particular case, there are still different points of view in the scientific community.  But look at it another way, we have raised global temperature by 0.8ºC already so how could the Russian heatwave have NOT been effected by global warming?", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Dan Miller", "channel": "UCbdIaDyU6_AdlDQqb43rDWA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQHJa6u0r5kkJyAVz85wMJUU3tJpsv_xGpSX_rB=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There is the science of ACW and then there are the economics of dealing with it and it is the economics which I feel way too many people are illiterate. To think that we have any clue as to what life will be like on earth in 1000 years, given the pace of technolocial and biological change we are likely to experience (see Kurzweil's \"Singularity\") is a huge leap of faith. I will not sacrifice my hypothetical $1 now for a discounted payoff in the future. My hypothetical $1 would have to yield >$1 in the future for it to make sense. Because I am a layman on this subject, others can explain it much better than I can and I'm sure you can source this quite easily. \n\n\nPoint #4 demonstrates poor logic. To illustrate why it is so faulty imagine I said this: I shat in the ocean and thereby polluted it. Subsequently, there was a bad storm and the health authorities closed the beach due to high levels of coliform bacteria.

{"cid": "UggHo0rm7XXoKngCoAEC.87HYkajUz9887_GL71uLVz", "text": "+Simon Tschinkel Your economic approach is invalid.  If you want to chose between eating one pizza now vs. eating two next week, that's fine.  But you want to chose to eat one pizza now and have our children eat no pizzas in the future.  Borrowing from our children is a moral issue, not an economic one.  But even from a pure economic analysis, it is much, much cheaper to address climate change now rather than pay for future impacts (see Sir Nicholas Stern, the IEA, World Bank, etc.).\n\n\nYour poop in the ocean analogy implies that the impacts of the +0.8C warming is just \"a drop in the ocean\".  That's not true.  The Earth's current \"energy imbalance\" (energy in minus energy out) which is driving global warming is about 0.6 watt/m^2 which is equivalent to having 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs going off each and every day.  That's not a drop in the ocean.  And that doesn't even include the energy that already went in to warming the Earth by 0.8C.  That's just the energy left to warm the Earth further based on our past emissions.\n\n\nIt seems that your basic argument is that there is uncertainty about climate change so we should wait until we are more certain before taking dramatic action that may impact the economy.  Yes, there is some uncertainty, but that is a reason for action, not inaction.  If an airplane mechanic says there is a 50% chance that the plane's engine oil seals are not in place properly, would you put your children on that flight?  Of course not, even though there is considerable uncertainty that the plane will crash.  The probability that business-as-usual emissions will lead to catastrophic climate change is much more than 50% (but it's not 100%).

People who make predictions or publish information from computers that make predictions that turn out to be demonstrably wrong, and claim accuracy, are the same as those guys that run around claiming you are going to hell if you don't do this or that.\nYou propose an excellent example though.\nGravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things attract one another including stars, planets, galaxies and even light and sub-atomic particles. Gravity is responsible for the formation of the universe (e.g. creating spheres of hydrogen, igniting them under pressure to form stars and grouping them in to galaxies). Gravity is a cause of time dilation (time lapses more slowly in strong gravitation). Without gravity, the universe would be without thermal energy and composed only of equally spaced particles. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the tides. Gravity has an infinite range, and it cannot be absorbed, transformed, or shielded against.\nThis will be an elementary example, however, it will serve the purpose.\nIf things mysteriously started  floating up to the sky, is there any scientist that would not pause and consider , and probably declare questionable, Newton's theory of gravity? Especially the part about , \"On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the tides. Gravity has an infinite range, and it cannot be absorbed, transformed, or shielded against.\"\nThat is because it has been proven by the scientific method, debated by the scientific method and adopted by the scientific method.\nThat is to say, theory supported by observations = science.

In this particular case, it is both (A) and (B).\n\n\nFrom Dr. mann's lawyer:\n“Their assertion that Dr. Mann faces possible bankruptcy is nonsense. Dr. Mann’s lawsuit against Dr. Ball and other defendants is proceeding through the normal stages prescribed by the BC Supreme Court Civil Rules and Dr. Mann looks forward to judicial vindication at the conclusion of this process.”http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2014/02/25/setting-the-record-straight-on-misleading-claims-against-michael-mann/\n\nAlso, the web site you linked to tries to discredit Dr. Mann, but his \"Hockey Stick\" chart has been confirmed over and over again by the scientific community, so all such efforts to discredit him are nonsense.\nSo I won't waste my time, I will not respond to any other of your posts that involve denier web sites (or articles spurred by climate deniers or denier web sites).  We all know where you are coming from.\nIf you would like to learn something real, I suggest you peruse RealClimate.org, a blog for and by actual climate scientists.  They discuss the actual science behind climate change.  You might learn something.

Oh good grief. \n - I personally know two young women (one about 35, the other about 25) who now bear scars over their throats from having their thyroid glands removed over the last few years, and that's here upwind of Fukushima, in South Korea.\nCancer is a huge growth industry here (pardon the unintended pun) with increasing numbers of people of all ages now needing to visit fancy expensive shiny new local and national cancer specialist hospitals. Cancer in kids (high school or younger) in Japan and the west coast of the US has sky rocketed in the last few years. And given the huge daily outpouring of radioactive water into the Pacific ever since the original tsunami knocked out most of the Fukushima reactors, have you wondered why so many seal pups are turning up dead or starving on the south east coast of the US recently, and why so many starfish suddenly have issues with not dissolving to the touch? - Okay, granted, these last two could be results from other effects more directly related to ocean acidification or other aspects of global warming; however, food from Turkey and other countries downwind of the Ukraine (ie. Chernobyl) still have higher rates of radioactivity than is normal or, indeed, safe, and Fukushima is already many, many times way worse than Chernobyl ever was.\nIs this the future you want more of?!

Another such great example is the late and very great Hermann Scheer, the granddaddy of the German solar industry.

It seems plausible that if we choose nuclear energy and stop the burning of fossil fuels, that at least we have somewhat protected that future, without sacrificing too much in the short term.\n\nI'm not a salesman. I'm just pointing out that if we have to choose between nuclear energy and the burning of fossil fuels, we should opt for the nuclear energy.

When someone owns something, they have a high incentive to look after it, the best example of this would be the comparison between public and private industries, be it education, healthcare etc. In these circumstances the private alternative is almost always more efficient, better quality and thus looked after better. If property rights were developed in such a way that you didn't just own your house, But the air around it to, and the local lake was not public, But someone owned that to, then pollution becomes impossible without suffering a law suit. If you pollute the air around my house, and I fall I'll as a result, then I have a pretty strong case against you the polluter. If you dump toxic waste in a stream that leads to my owned section of the river and incidentally my fish die and my water becomes useless, then I can sue you the polluter for damages.

I provided a rational!\"\nHowever, here is a bit more detail:  \nThe 1% number comes from a mine safety chart.  Less than 1% CO2 is acceptable for virtually everyone.  2% causes many people to have shortness of breath.  5% kills those in the mine. \n1600 ppm or 0.16% comes from practices in commercial greenhouses which pump CO2 into their buildings to improve plant growth.  Perhaps the 1600 number should be higher and 1600 ppm is all greenhouses are willing to pay for in the interest of promoting growth and saving water.  They are in business to generate income and CO2 is an expense.\nIt is pretty clear from this graph that long ago there was between 5% and 8% CO2 in the atmosphere and that level has reduced to almost nothing, about 180 ppm, during the more recent glaciations. Plants start to die at 150 ppm.  If plants die, we die.  It is also clearly evident that, over 600 million years, temperature has moved quite independently of CO2 and that even 5% or more atmospheric CO2 does not cause some bizarre run-away temperature increase.\n\nHope that more fully addresses your question.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Ron_the_Skeptic", "channel": "UC-IR_w0BsspgvdeeGVxLAbw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFpPdiKyiMBBggdY4jePLleSJtur8_Cuc7QdR_=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Neither of these actions affect water vapour or cosmic radiation, so neither of these actions will affect either global warming or climate change.  The other point worth noting is Earth consumes CO2 in various ways and plants require CO2 for their life.  Even at current levels which the uninformed claim to be too high, we are at nearly the lowest levels of CO2 in the last 600 million years, and plants are nearly starved of CO2.
