So LWT has the same accessibility as any other hyper-funded capitalist youtube channel.

LWT was a great tool to help acclimate my boomer-aged parents to more leftist ideas, and friendlier to more in-depth discussions. It feels to me like a basic tool to help people who are \"not interested\" in discussing finer points, or have previously been incurious, connect to the part of themselves that drives investigation. So when I started recommending more left-leaning-info-shows (Like our pal phil-o-tube here) they took it in stride. I haven't had that kind of ease with folks who aren't drawn to LWT and similar content.\n\nIt's awful that a lot of people just sit in the liberal kiddie pool.

You sit down and relax, not in any elated or distressed state of mind. The state of awareness you are in‚Äîthe emotional state you return to and have returned to all your life‚Äîcan exist in a future life. That calm state is who you are from a point of view of awareness. It is the neutral state you return to after anger, sadness or excitement. I refer to this as baseline awareness.\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt confuse awareness with an object. If I throw a basketball into a volcano it‚Äôs gone for good. I can make one just like it but I won‚Äôt have the same one ever again. This is the way it is with objects, but processes are different. I can play the same song again and again on the radio, because a song is a process. Baseline awareness is also a patterned process in the brain. But it is probably not unique. Anger is the same kind of experience for everyone because it produces a universal response. Indeed, our ability to empathize with others indicates universality, even though the particulars may differ.¬† Your baseline awareness‚Äîthe awareness you return to after a heated moment‚Äîis probably something that is common to many other people. Who‚Äôs to say it can‚Äôt exist again?\n\n\n\nConsider this: If someone hits me over the head I will see stars (as opposed to some other geometric form). But so would anyone else. It doesn't matter which human brain you have, everyone sees stars, because the process of getting hit over the head and the brain's way of processing that event is the same for everyone (more or less). No one reports seeing squares or circles instead of stars. If a bee stings me on the back of the¬†\n\nPage 2\n\nhand then stings you on the back of the hand the only difference in perception would be in degree, not kind. The reaction to the bee sting is universal in kind but maybe not in degree. The point is that our underlying awareness is common, not unique. Humans are genetically very similar. But these sensations occur to baseline awareness\n\n\n\nSince awareness is a process it can cease to exist then exist again. I can play a song ten times on ten different radios. The confusion comes in when people think of living¬†\n\nbeings as objects. But minds are patterned processes, not objects.¬† The two things have different ontologies.\n\n\n\nI am a continuation of what I was a year ago. Likewise, I would not necessarily expect to have an absolutely identical baseline awareness as the person I was in a previous life. All that would be needed is for certain key features to be the same. If I project a square of light onto a wall it could slowly turn into a circle. But the circle would be a coherent continuation of the square. However, reincarnation is seen here as a matter of recurrence, not continuation.\n\n\n\nAll my awareness arises out of my baseline awareness. So, if a baby born today has baseline awareness that is a recurrence of a baby from 1,000 years ago the baby born¬†\n\ntoday is a reincarnation of the baby from 1,000 years ago.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 3\n\nAbout baseline awareness, there are three and only three possibilities: 1.) it is unique to each person 2.) It is possessed by different groups (meaning each group possesses it‚Äôs own baseline awareness ). 3.) It is common to everyone. The reason I strongly doubt¬†\n\nthe first option is that different emotions (anger, sadness, etc.) are the same types of experiences for everyone. Anger is one pattern of awareness, sadness another, etc. Also, people act like me when they are relaxing. This simply means that you can tell when someone is relaxing or tense. This could be analogous to a stare.¬† Each time I lapse into a stare it is the same state of awareness that I have experienced before.¬† Also, since I am only a recurrence of what I was in a previous life, I do not need to have identical baseline awareness that that person had.¬† So, since even option 1 could¬†\n\nproduce reincarnation, reincarnation very well may occur, because baseline awareness is the part of me that feels emotion, and the higher faculties have their base in this¬†\n\nawareness and follow from it.¬† If options 2 or 3 hold I am even more likely to reincarnate because there would be a stronger correlation between the baseline awareness of this life and the previous life.¬†\n\n\n\nA possible counter to this argument is that the influence of genes on the human population would cause each individual to have unique and unreproducible baseline aware\n\nness.¬† However, the gene pool for humans is very small, and certain traits, like brown eyes, are almost universal.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 4\n\nWhile it is true that each beaver dam is unique, the method of building beaver dams is universal.¬† It stands to reason that there is only one type of consciousness that produces beaver dams.¬† It has minuscule variations, but that consciousness is one process with many possible forms.\n\n\n\nIf I slip into a coma and wake with a different personality I am still the same person because I am a continuation of what I was before the coma.¬† Likewise, I could just as easily be the same person I was in a previous life even if I have a different personality.¬† My thinking is that baseline awareness is one coherent type of awareness since it serves a definite purpose, which is to sense the world is a broad way, to be receptive to changes both internally and externally so that any impulse which needs to arise can. But even if there is no self, my experience of life would be recurrent. ¬† ¬†\n\n\n\nBut by far the best objective evidence for baseline awareness comes from evolution.¬† A hunter-gatherer would have to return to the same relatively flat emotional state so he could make tools, stalk prey and gather fruit. If he were distracted by his emotions constantly he would not be able to focus. Focus is only possible when one is undistracted.¬† In this way, baseline awareness would not be like a snowflake, created by chance winds.¬† It has been carefully molded by natural selection to be consistent in each person.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 5\n\nI realize current science cannot verify whether someone has actually reincarnated, but with this mechanism in mind there may be a way of exploring the issue more deeply. ¬†\n\nMuch more work would need to be done.¬† Of all the billions of people who have lived before it is possible that someone who died before I was born had a baseline awareness that was close enough to mine to be a match.¬† I can say nothing with certainty though.¬† ¬†\nPage 5\nAnother way of looking at the problem is through the lens of what I call ‚Äúmost basic awareness.‚Äù Most basic awareness is the awareness to which all thoughts occur. As with baseline awareness, three possibilities are present: It may be unique to each individual. It may consist in groups. It may be universal. As with baseline awareness, the same caveats apply. If I say, ‚ÄúIt occurs to me it‚Äôs Sunday‚Äù I mean the thought that it is Sunday occurs to my most basic awareness. I am not my thoughts anymore than I am the hair on my head.\n\n \n\nMost basic awareness recurs in each generation after the time of my death. I am most basic awareness. It is the seed from which all my awareness arises. Therefore, since it will recur, I will recur. Therefore, reincarnation. The existence of most basic awareness is confirmed by the fact that Buddhist monks can enter a thoughtless state in which they are still aware.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Joel Fry", "channel": "UCMqzGwCJ9RgCgdy_t_k4R-A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSJHSOBvygRr0CNJYE03GmjKkIfaOMgPrjQN05p=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I've been worrying about climate change since I was old enough to know about it, but I'd always felt powerless because, well, I was a kid. I couldn't change things, couldn't vote, couldn't even leverage my money as a consumer because I didn't have any. That's still mostly the case, to be fair. But I felt like things were maybe starting to change. That we might have been getting close to the tipping point of actually doing something. I was skipping school, going to the protests, shouting my heart out. And it felt like at least I was doing something, and maybe it would even make a difference.\n\nAnd then covid came, and it all just stopped. In the beginning, I was still excited. There was the big thing with the oil, the price going negative, and I felt like maybe, if it went on long enough, then people would start to realize that oil hasn't been profitable since the 70s and it would shut down. But then it didn't. And we're a year in, and it's not like the crisis is on pause, but it feels like everyone thinks it is because I haven't heard the word climate change from a politician since last march. \n\nI am grieving. I'm one of those teenagers who's growing up in a world they know will be ruined before they can save it, who's grieving for the future that could have been if not for inaction and lies and people just not caring about the world they would leave behind for us. It hurts. It hurts in a way that losing someone never has, and that's partly because I've been lucky to not lose too many people, but also because we could have saved it, could be saving it, and we're just... not. \n\nI don't really know where to go from here. I'm doing my best, trying to not eat meat, walk or bike where I can, buy local, but there's only so much I can do. I still can't vote.

We're decades past it now, but there was a time when yes, computer processors were basically doubling in capability every year while also growing smaller and more power/heat efficient. But like Abby says, this isn't really a \"law\" the same way the laws of nature are. When we didn't yet understand the same microelectronics manufacturing techniques we do now, we were enthralled with the possibilities yet unexploited by this technology. Its only natural that we all piled on, each investor hoping to be the person \"responsible\" for the next big breakthrough. \n\nBut we've since figured out some pretty good techniques, and the rate at which major breakthroughs happen has slowed down significantly. We're now capable of manufacturing technology once though impossible so cheaply that we don't know what to do with the discarded husks. Moore's law, to all those in the know within the tech industry, has died.  It exists now as a means of manufacturing false hope in a vain attempt to keep investment coming in at the same rate without being able to advance technology in proportion.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Coaxill", "channel": "UCJw0yV2IH3mnHjo22Nqnmmw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRrOQwUHruVK1gI9910WvbqfyNQP1iU-ZrXz_A7_Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyUTwC1KVnsu3q623p4AaABAg", "text": "Saying science will sort it out is not denial. It's admitting the problem exist and that we can fix it. And yes we CAN solve the problem through techs like carbon capture which pull the CO2 out of the air and you can power those with renewable energy sources. Nuclear is also a great power source that doesn't create tons of CO2 like Coal/Oil power plants and should be a major push in \"going green\". \n\nProblem is due to the cold war fear of nukes and Radiation fears due to media propaganda such as the recent Netflix Chernobyl. A show in which they talk about all of Europe getting contaminated for a thousand years and an explosion that would take out a city 300 Km away which would make it more powerful than the strongest nuke ever built. All of which was propaganda by Russia to make themselves look better at the great effort they took to \"save Europe\" from a mess they made when in reality while tragic due to the level of incompetence in their government the greater European region was never in danger. \n\nI see climate changes scare as similar to the Radiation scare and the scare with Food that has been going on since the 1800s where some people have been saying that population will grow faster than our ability to make food and thus we'll be faced with mass food shortages, which help support eugenic and \"population control\" ideology. One of these original papers on this said that this shortage would happen about the time the population reached 1 Billion people. Yet today we have over 7B people and any food shortages are a distribution issue not a supply issue. There is more than enough food to feed everyone it's just the way it gets distributed. Like in a lot of 3rd world countries they have corrupt politicians that horde the food and let the people starve. In some countries they seized relief aid so those in power could feed it to their cattle and eat steak while the people starve. \n\nAll these kids feeling stressed over the climate change and radicalization of nut jobs who do horrible thing in the name of \"population control\" are a result of this hysteria. This I think is due in large part to media propaganda hyping up the issue in the same why they do with anti nuclear power sentiment and so many other things. After all the best test of science is the ability to predict the outcome and so far none of the drastic changes they alarmist have been yelling about are anywhere close to have happening despite them stating some 30 odd years ago we'd being seeing huge changes by now. Instead they keep pushing back the doomsday clock as their figures turn out to be wrong over and over. As I recall in the 90s with the big Hurricanes talk of global warming making it worst and worst, yet we ended up with a lull of nearly a decade with none or only minor storms while in recent years it's returning to normal but for those kids who grew up in the lull period it does seem like things are getting bad rather quickly. \n\n\n\nAnyone who has read, or at least heard of, the problem of the commons knows why it's pretty much impossible to get any sort of global consensus on curbing greenhouse gases. Much like the example in the book where you have a field that all farms share to let their animals graze on there is no incentive to try and manage the land well and limit grazing because someone else will just let their animals eat all the grass thus ruining it for everyone. No country wants to intentionally hinder it's economy when other countries don't do the same. \n\nThere are plenty of other reasons why we should make changes and I think those should be the focus of the debate. Because in order to get someone on board with any sort of change they have to think Climate change is a real issue worth the time and effort of making policy changes on. Some examples are Fossil fuels are a limited resource and will run out one day so it's best to find alternatives so when that day comes we are prepared, this is the real reason why a lot of power companies are looking into renewable as like many companies they care more about profit than the environment regardless of what their PR dept claims. \n\nAnother example Nuclear is a rather cheap, abundant, and safe power source despite what all the media misinformation says about it. It is also fairly cheap as when you compare France which went mostly Nuclear power to German that went full in on solar/wind you can see that the average France citizen pays realitivly little for their power bill while German has some of the highest electric rates in Europe. \n\nSo I have a lot more to say but this is gotten a lot longer than expect as much like the video this issue is very frustrating to discuss given all they media misinformation around the topic. So in closing I'll give you another story of media misinformation regarding the environment. Growing up there was tons of media coverage on deforestation and how it would have drastic impact on the planet at large (sound familiar?). They would show huge areas of forest being destroyed and spin stories of how recycling paper was good and we needed to stop using so much paper like with paper bags and such. Being the naive kid I was I believed them and the hype figuring these \"authorities\" must know what their talking about. \n\nTurns out though the cause and effect they were spinning wasn't true at all. Most paper products come from tree farms, that's right they are plants and we can grow them like any other crop. The rain forest were being cut down by poor farms to use as farm land and our paper consumption had NOTHING to do with it. Also turns out recycling paper is extremely bad for the environment as it requires a lot of toxic chemicals to bleach out all the paper and make it reusable again. There is less impact from just growing new trees and instead letting the paper naturally decompose as it is plant material. Combine this with the solution of using more plastics, such as plastic bags, has resulted in massive increase in toxic non biodegradable waste cluttering up the land and contaminating numerous areas. \n\nIt's like wind farms that kill tens of thousands of endangered birds or the solar farms that cover huge areas and displace local wildlife. People really need to look at if the supposed cure is worst than the disease.", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "PyroMancer2k", "channel": "UCha16AuRzKcPzkiiIWlJV9A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSkjOJq4xDGlIaQtu-rf0WtMknyzl4DDe2eCQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw3U4eU00kZ6PvnmZ94AaABAg", "text": "The problem with climate catastrophism is that we're now far enough into the future, many of the earliest predictions (which began manifesting in the 1950s, and really began to take off as of the 1970s) have been falsified.  We have not deforested the entire planet.  The oxygen has not run out.  The population bomb actually turned out to be a dud.  And while there are sensible measures we could take to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels (cough, if you really want to go green you've gotta go nuclear, cough) almost nobody who advocates for going green understands that the technology to successfully \"Get off oil!\" isn't where it needs to be in order for \"Getting off oil!\" to not result in truly catastrophic economic consequences.  Especially for developing economies.\n\nSo, consider the irony of first-world activists demanding the world \"Get off oil!\" but the people who pay the price for it aren't first-world.  They're developing.\n\nClimate catastrophism therefore has less to do with science, and more to do with millenarian doomsday prophesy.  Which like almost any form of religious fanatacism tends to make outrageous claims and predictions which are very near term, and which turn out to be not true.  Again, we've now gone far enough into the future that the doomsday predictions of the 1970s have most explicitly NOT come to pass.\n\nNow, back to practical solutions.  We could begin building nuclear reactors NOW and well into the next few decades which would eventually reduce our need for carbon-dependent electricity to practically nothing.  We have plans and designs for vastly safer, more efficient, and here's the exciting point, RECYCLABLE fission reactors which could power the globe re-using a lot of the spent fuel which most people get so hot and bothered about (pun fully intended).\n\nBut we won't do any of that, because people hear \"Nuclear!\" and they think CHERNOBYL and THREE MILE ISLAND and FUKUSHIMA and the nightmarish pictures these words conjur in the public mind.\n\nSo, we'll just keep predicting the end of the world (which inconveniently for demagogues never actually happens) and people will keep demanding we \"Get off oil!\" which also never actually happens.  Because nobody in the first-world econom(ies) who champions environmentalism or rings the climate alarm bell is any more willing to give up his or her or xer's creature comforts and 21st century luxuries and conveniences than anyone else.\n\nBut (s)he/xer sure loves to shout about it.", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Brad Torgersen", "channel": "UCxeiyTRS6I8V_DSFneOAAww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8vdakQIFB3nH3PYhK08ZtURZxc-NICQmNyYP-rw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Driscoll's berries is a brand that supplies fresh fruit to just about every grocery store in the US. They have thousands of acres in the southwest, and it has been doing irreparable damage to that land. It also uses a lot of water in a desert-like climate, so it uses even more energy than normal. This is all very expensive for them, so in order to keep berries cheep, they hire and then hold in conditions similar to slavery, new undocumented immigrants.

My friends- especially those who currently study climate science- have been hit hard by climate grief, specifically because they know enough to know just how bad it can get. Meanwhile the people making the decisions think snowballs disprove climate change. Expertise means nothing if no one listens to it, and that is one of the most depressing parts of this, because we could change- we could easily pull away from this path, but no one at the top is willing to do it.

And I don't want to diminish the ecological consequences of those events or the role that humans as a new apex predator may have played in them (although the science is far from settled on that). But I think often times we extrapolate moral positions from the science without examining our own deeply held biases of human exceptionalism. There were large ecosystem disrupting events that led to extinctions that happened as a result of species migration between North and South America during the formation of the Central American isthmus, but we don't engage in the same philosophical debate over the moral worth of placental mammals or the caribbean tectonic plate, because we see ourselves as somehow separate and distinct from these things.¬†\n\nI'm not a paleontologist, or a climatologist, and I'm certainly not a member of an indigenous nation, but what I'm slowly piecing together from what these people are saying is maybe the question isn't about how effectively we can mitigate our impact on \"nature\" but in acknowledging that it is impossible to not affect and be affected by the things around us and to take accountability and responsibility for that impact and use it for the good of all beings.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Saoirse Cameron", "channel": "UC06hh49AdTmCPfwokIvoazg", "votes": "14", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSAFgVzkp8rJKBPBZKcxKgQODg7PzepawwKrQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I want to share my perspective in the hopes someone might glean some comfort, as I have.  \n\nSome politicians and the media have catagorized what's happening right now as a \"mass extinction\". This is a misinterpretation of numerous studies that indicate we appear to be heading for a mass extinction. It's impossible to tell if an extinction event was a \"mass extinction\" without the clarity of hindsight. To be frank, if this is indeed a mass extinction, then no one will be around to categorize it. \n\nBased on the fossil record, the best predictive factor for the survivors of mass extinctions (among vertebrates) is a body size of <25kg. This is because smaller animals require less energy to sustain themselves and during extinction events energy is harder to come by. Exceptions to this rule include animals with exceptionally low metabolic rates, such as reptiles, enabling them to maintain higher body sizes during extinction events.\n\nHumans are not only over 25kg, we use roughly an additional 20% more energy than a mammal of comparable size due to our large brains. Our intelligence, which so many people believe will allow us to think ourselves out of the laws of nature, directly contributes against our selection for survival.\n\nI'm sure most are familiar with the Great Filter hypothesis (in reference to Fermi's paradox). To me it seems rather telling that shortly after we discovered space travel we manufacturered an existential threat to our species. If this apparently lifeless galaxy is any indication: we aren't alone in this blunder. \n\nAll that said, the silver lining is this:\n\nIn the same way that fire is part of a healthy forest ecosystem, mass extinctions appear to be a normal part of a healthy biosphere.\n\nAs indigenous philosophy tells us, we aren't separate from nature. This is true even as we poison our atmosphere and ravage our biosphere. The evolution of intelligent species, like volcanism or asteroid impact, may simply be another forest fire for the tree of life.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Jay", "channel": "UClHFvITbNH5TjBE69h-59Og", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTW0vdDM1yiWT3RGsZF1sipEEQZtAPcIxcGqS0S_Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

That's6.8 QUINTILLION BTUs., or\n1.98 QUADRILLION KWh. That is a fucking LOT of energy. I haven't calculated how much global cumulative energy has been produced from coal, natural gas, and nuclear. All fossil fuels are stored solar energy, over millions of years, from hundreds of millions of years ago. And all that energy becomes heat. Car engines creates heat. Brakes creates heat. Tire friction and air resistance create heat. Trains, ships, jets all create heat. All electrical devices create heat (resistance). All the clever social media remarks end up as heat.\n\nSo take all that solar energy tied up in fossil fuels and release it over the roughly 150 years since large-scale consumption began, and add it to the heat from insolation (the sun), and add the heat from nuclear power... how the fuck do denialists think it's not going to warm up the biosphere? Where do they think it goes, an alternate universe? I mean, that is some fucking DUH shit.\n\nAnd in general: From where I sit, it seems like people just blithely, thoughtlessly keep consuming, living in the moment like animals do, with no thought for the future. And it's accelerating.\nI'm old. I'll be dead in a few years, so I personally could give a shit what happens to the planet. But I recycle, and combine trips, and don't eat factory meat, and use LED bulbs, and don't buy warehouses of poorly made Asian sweatshop shit to fill landfills with. I recycle, I conserve, I make do.

Yeah, you might know what is happening, but what can you do about it as an individual?  Not much really unless you're willing to actually take up arms and fight, even that might be fruitless.\n\nThat's just a hypothetical, however I think everybody in the climate change debate gets stuck on whether it is real or not.  That is a problem, but it's not really the biggest problem.  The biggest issue isn't whether or not it is real, it is what do we do about it?\n\nThat is such a multi faceted issue that an entire government would have to rise up that specifically aims to defend the planet.  \n\nI'd imagine such a country wouldn't be nice either.\n\nRealistically speaking, the only thing that can change things with the amount of urgency needed as far as government is concerned is a violent and tyrannical communist uprising that seeks to seize the means of production to become green, and force citizens who do not want to comply with Earth friendly policy through camps and re-education centers.  The classic tyrannical communist regime with the objective of saving the world from pollution.\n\nThat is a hard pill to swallow, but do you really see everything about global economics and industry changing by itself anytime soon?  Do you see the opponents giving in and actively wanting to change policy and personal habits?  No, not in the kinda urgency needed anyways.  \n\nNow, before anybody else calls me a eco fascist or communist.  I don't think that tyranny is the answer, I don't believe there is any.  \n\nUnless if by some miracle, all the semis go clean, all the retail stores adopt reusable containers, the military becomes environmentally friendly, cargo ships as well as planes are able to maintain today's industrial demands without fossil fuels, and most importantly everybody becomes truly environmentally conscious.

Only when we re-embrace nuclear energy we have an actual chance to ditch fossil fuels for good. No, that doesn't mean 100% nuclear, it simply means without nuclear fossil fuels will still be around making the climate worse even under the most ideal case for renewables.

I know a  few in real life from back when I played Magic the Gathering  and Warhammer and let me tell you there are a surprising amount of people who would never get a swastika flag or talk about white ethno-states, they behave like the arsonist. Someone who wears the skin of a neo-liberal as sheep's wool. They know how to walk and talk the politically correct line and they know what to say and not say so that a normie or centrist would assume, even seeing them regularly, that this person is a very well-to-do normal person, probably wouldn't really consider their politics very much because ti is so coded to be \"normal\".  Other fascists hear these dog whistles and know they have a friend, they can align and defend each other. Here's the hard lesson for leftists, you can't call these people out. When people tried, they game immediately devolved from \"you really have some worrying opinions that I disagree with\" into \"so you're calling me a Nazi, that is so typical, just because we have disagreeing ideas doesn't mean you can just attack and slander me\" and the thing that happens is that in spaces that are ordinarily white men, they don't tend to take the progressive stance. They are trying to be agreeable and friendly and the layers of obfuscation and deniability that people like The Arsonist creates means that trying to \"unmask\" them usually leads to that person being pained as a paranoid Commie that is attacking and censoring reasonable disagreement. This is Richard Spencer, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Ben Shapiro's whole game, maintain as much deniability as possible while moving the Overton window as far right as you can without normies noticing.

As air pollution is a purely physical phenomenon; and conflating our stupidity and selfishness on one topic with our same tendencies in other areas doesn't help our capacity to solve a known physical problem but just makes it a gordian social knot with no beginning other than \"be better at everything simultaneously and intuitively\". One's understandable rage at the stubbornness of others to embrace neither facts or empathy allows for easy heuristic pattern matching of every other problem caused by the same cognitive failing; but this totalising attitude itself lacks empathy for environmental conditions that makes people both individually and collectively this way. It's not a lack of solutions nor even willpower but we simply just aren't accustomed to implementing novel behaviour as fast as the current rate of system collapse. Blunt fact is hairless primates gained mastery with the wrong instincts; and will have to repair their damaged world after the fact. The sky isn't falling; it has fallen.

I already feel in debt for my existence.  I can do nothing to justify my existence.  I'm never going to make an impact,  nothing about the waste I create or the carbon footprint I leave behind can be justified.  I'm not even fucking happy.  I didn't ask to live.  I feel like I'm paying off a debt for something I didn't even buy.  I want out.  As a child, I already felt like a useless, overwhelming burden to my parents.  Learning about climate change just mirrors those feelings.  How am I not supposed to hate myself and other people?  Nothing I do can shake these feelings of extreme guilt away.  I don't want to take responsibility for myself and my life.  I don't want to create an arbitrary purpose that is supposed to justify my existence, for example, be successful, make a lot of money, raise a family, be a good person,  be compassionate and understanding, be involved in political activism, take on a spiritual practice, live life devoting your self to loving one other person in a romantic relationship, live life by appreciating everything and seeking happiness and pleasure.

{"cid": "UgxVIcBQLLBBefiRRoN4AaABAg", "text": "Wow, so that's weird. I have a lot of depression issues, and part of that is me being what Henry (or maybe his brother) James called a \"weak soul\", I need something to believe in to be satisfied with existence and I see existence as meaningless (which has lead me to Camus and Absurdism). But I have distinct memories as an eight year old, learning to read (not in school because doing what I was told was never my thing) but at the library with a set of encyclopedias on animals and learning that five out of eight species of tigers are extinct. This led me to very misanthropic views (and detention for writing \"humans suck\" on the wall at school, in pencil, in like normal sizing, hardly a graffiti master), many of which I do associate with my later understanding of the world and nihilism.\nWeird to think Greta saw something similar and responded so positively, trying to do something. Wish it was more inspiring at this moment, but does make me respect her more.\nThe nuance and depth in the discussion on American, immigration and California is simply amazing. \"Illegal\" (many of whom are legal immigrants that cross the border and apply for refugee status) immigrants are not from California, so what do they care about California compared to actual Californians. But then we talk about Manifest Destiny and how Americans are not really from California, but we talk about these people that built cities in big open areas where no one lived (much of which is not even remotely true) in completely different terms than the immigrants that are currently moving into these cities, who contribute more than they take (according to numerous studies, some by the American Government) and how I would like to be an American and move to a place I am not from. The double standards constantly being applied in discussions about immigration, never quite so beautifully covered. Reading the reverse of the Statue of Liberty's mandate is a little heart wrenching.\nI would add to the perspective about police that MIGHT sympathize with climate issues that they face rather severe personal obstacles while within the police force. The police are often called a brotherhood, a fraternity (which is the same thing in French), etc. They rely heavily on peer pressure, cops do not report on other cops, when they do they get called rats and have their lives threatened by cops (several examples spring to mind, there was a whistle blower in the Baltimore PD, there was a copy who reported one of her coworkers was driving unsafely and speeding without cause, there was a New York copy that got committed and had evidence against police corruption confiscated, all of these have happened in the last 10ish years). As much as all of that might be a reality, even if it is not, it is portrayed as such in the media, which feeds into this idea, making it very hard for individual police officers to act like individuals instead of cogs in a machine, for fear they might piss off and alienate their social circle (some of whom might even be friends) or people that they rely on in dangerous situations (many whistle blowers report having no response or backup when in situations that require it, including getting shot at), not to mention the overt threats. Being outcast or exiled can be emotionally difficult or traumatic for normal people, but police forces psychologically build these relationships to be more dependent.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Braden Scott", "channel": "UCl7l2EUN_kuGJBOc8jgwezw", "votes": "22", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS_OtExC-3vuCggKfrgKV5mZC2UEKu7aI-u0g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Or do the workers choose to shut down their place of production because of environmental consciousness? What if their livelihoods depend on that factory? What if a lot of people depended on that factory to produce essential goods for them? \nThe problem with just blaming corporate greed for wrongdoings is that the fundamental structure that keeps pollution and environmental abuse in place don't change; we need to burn resources to produce things because we live in civilisation. People will still need clothes, will need to eat and will need to live in houses even if you bring in a revolution that tears the existing system down; Oil is still needed to power cars and houses. Unless you find alternatives for the production of energy and goods this will remain a constant, whether you live in capitalism or not. I strongly fail to see how this problem is endemic to capitalism as we can clearly observe that socialist nations  have also been horrid for their environment; Soviet economic policy still affects many of the old territories of the USSR to this day. The only nations that seem to actually have attempted to implement environmental protection policies to an efficient degree do specifically seem to be European countries. In the past 20 years only the European and North American continent have seen an actual reduction in emissions. So is it a fault of capitalism as a whole? Because it seems more complicated than that. \n\nThat said I like many of the issues being pointed out here, I just have trouble understanding how you can draw the conclusion that taking part in violent, and ultimately ineffectual protests somehow solves the main issue.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Erik K√ºhl", "channel": "UCPboAmb4-16qBPkJuVsl3qw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQPsS8-ZfT-viqAePFi-cc9mISddePgN5YcVfZ0jQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxUr7PVWQxlpV1iE6B4AaABAg.9-pg3NJOqKV9-srGvTePKY", "text": "Good questions Erik, here is my answer:\nEver notice how CEO's never have enough money?  They never stop and say \"Well I have more money than I know how to spend, time to retire!\".  They keep working, and they keep other people working, to produce excessive amounts of wealth that isn't even being used.  There is no concept of a minimum or maximum amount of work, only \"more\".\n\n\nIf workers owned the means of production, would this same rule apply?  Of course not.  If you're in a factory cranking out sandwiches, and everybody in town has enough sandwiches...would you keep working?  No!  You could relax and take it easy for a while.  Supermarkets already throw away millions of tons of food a year, you realise that means we produce far too much food, right?  We wasted energy, we wasted resources, and for what?  For the sake of a CEO's bank account.\n\n\nThe fundamental structure still has an environmental impact, sure, but without the bizarre and irrational drive to constantly maximise production, would it be nearly as destructive as it is now?\n\n\nAnd let's not even get into how bad some regulations are.  To save money, many industries cut corners at the expense of the planet.  We don't need to do that.\n\n\nAs for the final question, yes it is 100% capitalism's fault.  In no other system could there have been an incentive to create this crisis.  And this WAS created on purpose.  There's a reason the climate science was suppressed back in the 80's, there's a reason GWB censored his own agencies from talking about it.  A few very rich people will get even richer out of all this, that's the only reason this is happening at all.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "DeoMachina", "channel": "UC1D6ZmxR3Df6AMn-0u3ZUdw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQfJ0gOsXH-Vt-7btrKzipOPAyxWlAjQtcD=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

(I'm paraphrasing)\nI think that's true in a fairy tale but he's really only looking at it from a philosophical perspective which makes sense since he's a philosopher but he's failing to see it from an economic standpoint as well as a practical standpoint. Let me explain, it is not possible to open our borders and let the world flood in without extreme poverty resulting from it. We do not have the infrastructure that can handle a mass and sudden increase in population. This would absolutely destroy the United States. I think it's great that right now we have a great job surplus however we don't have that many jobs. I like some of this guy's videos but some of them are very misinformed.

There are more than one economic alternatives to capitalism. And if you actually read my comment, I suggested a \"significant overhaul\" to our current economic system, which does not necessarily imply overthrowing capitalism completely, just modifying our system to the point where priority is placed on stopping climate change over capital profit for the 1%. That requires  that we stop pushing for free market capitalism, because it will never be in the interest of fossil fuel companies bottom line to be more responsible.\n\n\n\"don't you think we would just turn into China?\"\nWell, China's economic policy is state capitalism, so I don't see how becoming communist would make us end up like China. China holds on to the title of communism as a form of nationalism, making themselves distinct from \"the west\" and all the flaws of their enemies, despite them both practicing capitalism. And whilst state capitalism does mean civil liberties and freedoms are often squashed, and power has no way to be decided by citizens, so it is in no way a perfect system, China has been able to significant improvements in renewable energy because the government gets decided where money is invested, not companies. Of course, they got those improvements by stealing patents from Australia, so don't misinterpret my words for saying China should be the ethical standard for our future.

And because, while idealism is very good and I often criticise those whose first instinct is to look for compromise, because if you're not going to stand for your ideals then what even is the point of living, I still have to acknowledge that the lack of education on differing economic systems and the stigma of communism and socialism in particular left over by the 'Red Scare' and the accompanying almost religious worship of capitalism by the right side of politics, particularly in America, means reforming capitalism and incorporating aspects of socialism into it as opposed to going complete socialism is a better method for achieving economic reform atm.\n\n\n\"my point is that switching to nuclear energy would be a more rational approach\"\nK, that's fine, it just seems contradictory to your first comment where you recommend lowering the prices of fossil fuels.\n\n\n\"would be a more rational approach opposed to restructuring the worlds economic systems.'\nWhy can't we have both?

(most of those companies have a cartel where they 'negotiate' prices with each other, so they can all agree to use the same justification)\nwithout the people actually having the willingness to make a sacrifice themselves the simple prospect of higher pricing will make everyone rebel against those regulations.\r\nthey'll also use creative accounting making them look more green than they actually are.\njust going after the top 100 is also extremely bad, that will just mean they'll split up into 'small family factories' making people feel good that there's no big bad company to pollute anymore even though in reality everything is the same.\nthere's also the problem that  they employ a huge amount of people which will make the government less likely to actually do something since losing a lot of people jobs is frowned upon when elections come around.\nand that's not even taking marketing and lobbying into account, something which has always had huge influence no matter how 'woke' people all think they are.\n\nbesides that there is the fact that animal agriculture is extremely underrated when it comes to climate change, it's just much easier to just tally up numbers like co2 than look at complex things like the carbon cycle which is actually the important factor in climate change, not gas emissions.\nfor instance we could see fish-less oceans by the year 2048 due to fishing alone, this means plankton does not get fertilized by the fish eating dead material below and crapping it out on the surface. the ocean right now comprises 40% of the carbon cycle, reducing or even losing all of that will be catastrophic to the climate.\nbut even without fishing added to the total, animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, desertification, ocean deadzones, species extinction and lots of other nasty shit they don't tell you in the media.\n\nthey also have a huge amount of marketing behind them, it even convinces people that 'grass-fed' is less polluting than factory farmed, even though grass-fed is by far the leading cause of deforestation in the amazon and desertification due to overgrazing.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Leon Kootstra", "channel": "UCr4N27hHPx0EFHJMdsUiYDw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ7Y0aPlL7MtLk2y_IrRr-p5kYhPsUlGKT1exck=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There are no benefits over here and in deed the stats say you are less likely to be employeed, less likely to find housing, and more likely to be the victim of abuse post coming out. So if there where any government benefits, the socail ills would easily out weigh it. Unless you think having a higher chance of dying and having your killer set free is not that bad.

And yet these are the same Leftists who, in their very next breath, will tell you that we need to abolish prisons and police because punitive justice is fundamentally wrong. It seems like a blatant contradiction that's hard to justify. Is there a point where a person's wrongdoings are so vast and heinous that our normal standards for justice don't apply? Is killing the planet so much worse than killing a single person, or even a hundred people, that to punish the latter is unjust, but to not punish the former is also unjust? Or are we just rationalizing our desire to protect our perceived in-group and punish our out-group?

{"cid": "UgyCKxfbHdtH0Z5jVsN4AaABAg", "text": "Great video. I agree with the interconnectedness of the struggles, still there's one that should be mentioned and rarely is, even on Lefttube, which is disappointing. Fortunately Mexie and Mad Blender, among a few others, do talk about it. You said that Bastani \"leaves the moral stuff to the side\", but don't you as well partially? When will the equally urgent issue of animal rights be brought up? Animals rights is environmental rights is labor rights is migrant rights is human rights.\n\nMost of all deforestation is caused by the demand for meat and animal products. Bolsonaro's agrobusiness friends aren't just burning the Amazon for the sake of it. They're doing so to clear more land for crops to feed \"livestock\" to meet consumers' demand for meat and animal products, i.e., for profit. Forests are necessary not just to produce oxygen but to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and they're home to countless individuals of countless species. Animals (human and non-human) lose their homes and lives so that monocultures of soy and corn can be grown to feed an excessively unnatural and unsustainable (to put it lightly) number of animals bred by artifical insemination just to be slaughtered in their infancy. These tens of billions of animal are the main emitters of methane globally (methane being an even more dangerous greenhouse gas than CO2), their feces are dumped into rivers and seas causing the largest ocean dead zones, and the animal agroindustry alone (including its own transportation sector) emits more CO2 than all transport industries combined. That's all cars, buses, trains, ships and airplanes. And those are very much a huge problem in and by themselves. If that wasn't bad enough we're also destroying marine ecosystems and killing trillions of aquatic animals per year. People making a big deal about not using straws to save fishes but won't stop eating fishes, and don't mind that more than half of the human waste that keeps killing animals in the oceans are nets and other byproducts from fishing industries.\n\nEven if all that wasn't contributing more than anything else to climate change, we're talking about individuals. Not just specimen of their respective species, but sentient beings with intrinsic value/self-worth regardless of their species, each one of whom would have tried to escape death and suffering just like we would if they could.

My conclusions, so far, have been that our daily lives need to be extremely simplified and that all essential services that require technology should be maintained as much as possible. That means unmechanised vegetalian (or maybe even vegan) permaculture (which is more efficient at producing food per area, is a carbon sink and doesn't require as much intrants like fertilizers and pesticides) needs to become the standard for our food needs. Transportation also needs to be greatly reduced and massive centralized systems need to be limited as a result. An extremely localised lifestyle and urban exodus will inevitably happen. We just need to decide weither or not we want to direct it or let it happen by itself.\n\n\nWhile Jem Bendell's analysis might be simplistic, it is based on a lot of litterature and there have been meta-analysis that compare scientific predictions with how they actually happened in reality and the data shows that, most of the time, the conclusions drawn in climate papers were too conservative on the damage and temperature rises. So there's also that which we need to keep in mind.\n\n\nSo, the idea of going back to a pre-industrial world might not be the solution or even feasible, but there is a real need to see what we want to keep and what we need to let go or else, a civilizational collapse might not allow such a selection and everything might go away with it.\n\n\nIn simpler terms, there's \"Comment tout peut s'effondrer\" by Pablo Servigne that shows how a lot of how our society operates is dependent on ecological factors and that the system itself is locked in place and cannot be changed without breaking it. His conclusion is that civilizational collapse is inevitable unless there is a significant revolution happening in the next years because too much damage has been done.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "IrontMesdent", "channel": "UC9OhW1cZV0EGKgb0AD_ELJA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTShzR0KVRo0cM9XwNTKku-LMH6uYs-QdVrQrOe=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But it is important for the worker to be happy and to live a living wage. That is why the minimum wage should be increased, however this does tend to lead in less hard working workers because they don't work at rates that someone else would if they are both getting the same wage, therefore a minimum wage should be in place in every workplace, as well as bonuses for those who work harder.

In socialism, it becomes 10 times more difficult to live a wealthy and lavish lifestyle. This is why wealth distribution doesn't work, because if you don't work as much as me, why should you get paid the same? And the assumption that the owner does nothing is hysterical be wise they provide the machines, the utilities, the risk, the building and the other things such as uniform or helmets. Plus not having owners means if there is a problems in the work place among workers there is no one person that can take power and resolve the issue. It could lead to a wreckless work place. However the workers do need to stay get a fair share but not as much as the owner considering without the owner the job is not possible. If I am the owner of a pencil factory, and I buy a warehouse, the led, the wood and some screws, all I need is some workers that can assemble it more efficiently, I could do it but it would much more time. If your work requires the use of just the basic use of your hands, why should you have more of the right of the means of production than me, the person who has provided you with the work, provided materials and the warehouse and everything else in the job? Say if we take your idea into consideration, what if I am  tasked with getting the materials and fail to do it, making it so that the rest can't even work, and doesn't that mean I dictate how much work the rest do and therefore dictate how much the rest get due to the profits being dictated by how many of that material I buy? Plus where does my money that I'm given come from in the first place or buy that material?

{"cid": "Ugxex48T5rKvl9e2grJ4AaABAg.8z4wtplmWhQ9-TwbFBOTp9", "text": "¬†@om khetz¬† So, in your words, the hard work of the capitalist is that \"they provide the machines, the utilities, the risk, the building and the other things such as uniform or helmets.\" None of these things is work, they are all simply things that the capitalist owns. They are the means of production. So your argument is that the capitalist deserves to own the means of production because... they own the means of production. \n\nAs for the question of leadership in a democratic workplace, I simply answer that democratic leadership is still leadership. For example, in the (Australian) Sydney BLF, a union so strong it was practically running a lot of workplaces, workers committees were set up to deal with a variety of disciplinary matters. Most notable was sexism and sexual harassment. And it was very successful, with women even being introduced to new roles that only men were allowed in before.\nIn fact, democratic leadership is fairer than a dictatorial management approach, because justice can only be relied upon when all parties are on equal footing. But bosses and workers are directly counterposed in interests - and the boss gets the final say. So if, say, the boss sexually harasses a woman - and the boss is the one in power - he's much more likely to get away with it.\n\nOn money - no, I never said I want to distribute money to everyone. I briefly mentioned distribution because in a capitalist world, we produce way more than we could ever use, and we use way less than is enough to support our population. This is because things are made to sell, not to be used. So for example, we throw away food while people starve. Houses sit empty while we have so many homeless people. etc. Its insane. So when I say distribution, I mean that in a world not run for profit, workers could make things and also decide how they will be used, rather than just selling it on a market. Every revolutionary movement that develops to a certain point reflects how workers naturally orient to looking after their collective needs. Take Sudan for example, where as a result of the ongoing revolution against the government, money is just kept in barrels in the street for those who need it. This is because workers are a collective class with a collective interest, while capitalists are pushed into individualism by the fact that they rule and profit as individuals.\n\nAnd finally on Venezuela, Cuba and all those scary commie countries - the workers do not own the means of production.

Its the people who rule over the means of production as dictators (the ruling class, the bourgeoisie, the bosses, etc). Its not just about wealth, its about decision-making power and what production is being used for. For a capitalist to maintain their position in the economy, they must constantly accumulate more and more profit. And so a capitalist society is driven toward profits. This need for profits is why workers are exploited, its why wars are fought, its why the planet is dying, etc. However in a socialist society, because the means of production are democratically controlled, the collective working class is driven toward fulfilling human needs. I could argue on and on about whether or not capitalists earn their money (I don't think they do, and I believe profits are just stolen wages) but its largely irrelevant. The point is that there lies the possibility for everyone's needs to be met, for war and borders to be a thing of the past, and capitalists are the only hindrance to that goal.\n\nWe already produce enough to feed the world many times over. Everyone in the world could experience upper middle class living conditions. There is no real scarcity, the only reason people want in this world is because all the shit is getting hoarded by people who don't even use it.\nAnd lol globalism is capitalist. What I'm talking about is internationalism - the fact that all working people share a common human interest and that nations only exist for capitalist competition. Internationalism means I identify more with a chinese worker than I do with an Australian capitalist. And it means I'm against the brutal institution of borders. Its inverse, nationalism, is a product of capitalism. Only once nationalism is overcome can a revolution be successful, so no you won't see a resurgence in nationalism because of a revolution lol. A revolution could never occur if the workers are divided.\nIdeas like nationalism only serve the ruling class, and throughout history every time the working class engages in militant struggle against the capitalists - the experience of being in that struggle, that is the experience of standing on one side of a class war, always leads to the disintegration of backwards ideas like nationalism and sexism. This is because class struggle makes you realize what side you're on, who else is on that side, and who your enemies are.

American politics tend to be heavily aimed at external threats in rhetoric, but we are also seeing a lot of that aimed at Americans who simply disagree or who are law abiding but \"disloyal\". In countries like Saudi Arabia I am not sure that they consider all of the threats external, they have a history of internal conflicts, between religious extremism (also a problem in the US and the source of the vast majority of terrorist attacks, although a single foreign terrorist attack does dominate the number of casualties caused), cultural and religious differences and disagreements, separatist movements and perceived notions that some internal groups are associated with external groups (ie. Yemen and Iran, Iran is notably predominantly Shia, whereas many of their political opponents are Sunni and have a history of conflict with their own Shia population).\nI also reflexively disagree that crisis does not lead to the loosening of the powers of the state. There are occasions where the state (depending on the state and it's political ideology) have decided that specific groups can do it better than they can. But I have trouble proving that idea and most of my thoughts support your claim (for instance many countries have sold off state owned military equipment producers because the political climate was less tumultuous and it was felt that having them as for-profit businesses would be better than simply only making rifles for the French army, etc.). The only supporting argument I can come up with is the review of whichever board it was (want to say some education board) that reviewed safety procedures for school shooting following the Stoneman Douglas shooting, where they essentially passed their responsibility off to teachers (who arguably, largely depending on your politics, are already overburdened with responsibilities, some, like providing pencils and paper in certain areas where that is a noted problem, should be handled by the parents or underfunded school board) by recommended that they have firearms to defend their students. One of the shooting in Texas (one go with El Paso, the one that had Beto respond while on the campaign trail, it unfortunately becomes difficult to keep track when there are so many) was also followed up with firearms laws that are looser, allowing firearms onto or into school grounds, churchs, private property where the property owner might take exception (but no longer has the legal right to control that). Again, an example of the state or a state body trying to shift responsibility away from itself and onto the individual who is not trained, equipped or funded to do so. These examples are outliers and do come from two of the craziest places in the world (on many different metrics, but lets just say crazy in what laws they implement for this discussion), Florida and Texas, so are hardly proof, if anything they are the \"exception(s) that proves the rule\".", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Braden Scott", "channel": "UCl7l2EUN_kuGJBOc8jgwezw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS_OtExC-3vuCggKfrgKV5mZC2UEKu7aI-u0g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Words actually mean things, we're not in some post modernist wonderland where you can just be like 'oh yeah I'm a socialist, because to me socialism means like welfare and stuff'. Socialism as a historic political movement, before its distortion by the social democrats and the stalinists, has always been a revolutionary struggle through which the workers win their own liberation by destroying the existing capitalist state and replacing it with one that is owned collectively by the working class. Corbyn is a social democrat - that is, he is a capitalist politician who relies on working class support in order to get elected as head of the capitalist state. In practice, what this often looks like is promising to put industries under the control of the capitalist state so that they can be better taxed and regulated for the benefit of workers.

Because when it comes down to it, social democrats are just like all other pro capitalists in that they will do anything to stop revolution. The German socdems sided with fascist militias against the socialists, the Russian socdems joined the whites in the civil war against the reds, etc. So it would be pretty bizarre of you to suggest that two political tendencies who have actually gone to war with each other over the fundamental and irreconcilable differences of their politics are similar enough that we can just call them all 'socialists'.

The Holodomor didn't merely hit kulaks - it hit all peasantry in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. This was because the USSR's Ministry of Agriculture under Stalin employed a quack who had an anti-genetic worldview that resulted in the execution of a whole team of geneticists under the great purge. This quack developed an extremely unsustainable means of growing crops that went unchecked because he refused to let his ideology get ceded to basic science. The same crop growing technique was later used in China under Mao, which also resulted in a widespread famine. This issue is only semi related to the topic because Stalin invoked the expropriation of kulak properties during his Collectivization plan, but then started demanding impossible quotas from ppl whose crops weren't producing shit because of the quack Trofim Lysenko getting caught up in the hubris of his senpai Stalin noticing him and commending him for his \"Revolutionary Ideas\" and executing the dissidents who kept warning him that his model would cause massive shortages.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Paperlight Boy", "channel": "UCapStSUCeu-snQObm4DcHAw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRGDoqB3_vRayDD3AIgGLUPcVAShpqw2ax8pKo3Tw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxlLw_Xq3bdxBZGdTp4AaABAg.8z4XWYe86h09D9WNLlz9Ht", "text": "¬†@daniel santos¬†  These things are also important! I can tell you're well read. Although I think they require a little more elaboration if you don't mind\r:\n\r\nFirst, we are in agreement on deforestation being a major driver of climate change. Deforestation is one of the main human activities directly affecting carbon emissions and albedo. Reforestation is actually one of the main potential ‚Äúnegative carbon emissions‚Äù that people are working on! It‚Äôs a pretty hopeful field in climate science, a lot of grad students in my department are studying it. Grassland restoration is another cool field.\n\nThe positive feedback mechanism of water vapor is closely tied to carbon dioxide emissions, and can be summed up like this: water vapor is a greenhouse gas, but the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled by the temperature‚Äîthink of how much more humid it is in the hot days of summer compared to crisp and dry winter. However, left on their own, the atmosphere and oceans have an equal exchange of water vapor in the short-term, because they are naturally in balance‚Äîthat is to say, the amount of water that evaporates from oceans (and lakes, rivers, etc.) would roughly equal the amount of rain from the atmosphere. What happens when you have a water vapor feedback is that the temperature of the atmosphere rises, allowing it to evaporate and hold more water vapor than it rains out, leading to humidity rising, which leads to more temperature rise, which leads to more humidity. BUT, for the water vapor feedback cycle to begin, it needs something to make temperatures higher in the first place, and that is what carbon emissions do. People who study the climate often refer to carbon as the ‚Äúdial‚Äù to turn the heating machine on, and water vapor as the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù itself. Carbon can only warm things so much by on its own, but that small amount of warming allows the atmosphere to hold that much more water, and that water heats the atmosphere, and so on. However, because atmospheric carbon primarily comes from our combustion of fuels and water vapor comes primarily from the oceans and lakes, those initial carbon emissions are the part of the cycle that we can control. So you are correct in that the water vapor feedback is important, but it is a downstream effect of carbon emissions.\r\n\n‚ÄúDecomposing organic matter‚Äù likely refers to permafrost (unless you meant something else?) which is indeed a huge potential source of carbon. However, like the water feedback cycle, you only ‚Äúunlock‚Äù that organic matter from permafrost at high temperatures, so you have to have something forcing the temperature higher in the first place. Again, that initial rise in temperature is the result of those first carbon emissions that we put into the atmosphere.\r\n\nThe warming of the ocean ‚Äúby chemicals‚Äù is not what is going on‚ÄîI think you mean ocean acidification. The warming of the ocean is due to the warming of the atmosphere, and the ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù you are referring to is carbonic acid, which is produced when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere pairs with ocean water to form a weak acid. This is mainly concerning because it can dissolve the shells of marine animals, but carbonic acid does NOT warm the oceans in and of itself. The warming of the oceans comes from the warming of the atmosphere. \r\n\nYou may also have been referring to methane hydrates in the ocean, which are essentially bubbles of methane trapped in ice that can be released by increases in ocean temperature, and function as another feedback loop. But again, the ocean would have to already be warming for those to be released, so there must be some other reason for why the ocean is warming before methane hydrates come into play. \r\n\nThat all goes to say, the existence of climate feedbacks is an even stronger argument to wind down carbon emissions, not an argument that they don't matter. Carbon is the part of that system over which humans have power. \n\nUltimately I think this is one of the more interesting philosophical angles of climate change‚Äîwhether we humans become victims of our own unconscious biological success, or we bend the chemistry of the entire planet to serve our needs.

This comment comes from a place of love, so please don't be upset with me, but... your conclusion about collective political action (24:20 to 24:50) is just wrong. This is THE big mistake that we on the left have been making for decades. Trying to make political movements bigger by forming coalitions of diverse interests, arguing that the interests are really the same, is precisely why leftist politics often goes no where.\nLabor rights, climate change and trans rights are NOT one issue. People can, and will, agree on what to do about one and still be unable to agree on what to do about the others. Trying to solve everybody's problems simultaneously is bad strategy. It doesn't build coalitions, it weakens focus.\n\n\nYears ago, I went to a huge gay rights protest march in Washington, DC. It was inspiring to see hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating for something they believed in so strongly, something that mattered to them personally. The event was not helped in any way by the speech Jesse Jackson gave that day in favor of DC statehood. And I doubt it helped the cause of DC statehood much either.

{"cid": "UgwOpKt4KkQ-sjlU_Vh4AaABAg", "text": "So, this is kinda a tangent, but I just watched Weathering With You in theater yesterday and there are definitely references to climate change there. In particular, in the ending it was mentioned that Tokyo was once a swamp and that Tokyo being submerged is just nature returning to what it once was or reclaiming what it once had - something along that line. There is also a reference to modern political climate with the words \"the world was always mad to begin with,\" in the ending as well.\n\nI feel that that's the creator's way of expressing his acceptance on the current situation and how there is no way to take back what we've done anymore, the window of time for doing so has passed. The world was always a shitty place and nature always work in a balance, and in the middle of all of that all we can do is just deal with our personal issues and build a meaningful relationship with others.\n\nAnd I feel like that that's the most practical way 9f seeing things for normal people who won't, can't , make any sacrifices out of the way they're living.

Rightwingers take over government property and threaten to kill anyone who stops them and law enforcement is like, \"It would be better if you stopped, but hey, I don't want you to feel too pressured about all this.\" \n\nWhereas protest in the name of leftist causes like environmental destruction, economic inequality, and racism, and the police are pretty much all say, \"Say hello to tanks and tear gas, motherfuckers!\" not hesitating in the slightest when it comes to force. \n\nIt's a matter of power and hierarchy. Rightwing protests, while irritating, tend to reinforce traditional systems of power and control. If nothing else, the chaos that results is generally contained within the lower levels of the societal pyramid, posing little threat to those at the top. \n\nLeftwing protests, on the other hand, call out traditional systems of power and control and openly challenge them. This poses a direct threat to those at the top of the societal pyramid, so naturally, the tanks and tear gas will come out to play pretty quick. \n\nAnyone protesting for any leftist causes should expect nothing less than brutality from law enforcement, plain and simple.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SPDYellow", "channel": "UCPt8OMangmKR4BrkNBBS81w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT-RDN5lOl1g7HEH8jtgtr8K2fQSJxp0W84-w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzKjrXa6aIc28oZAQJ4AaABAg", "text": "Well somebody has problem covered these points, but first:\r\n\n\n\nInterestingly one of the reasons Moore's law has been descriptively accurate (over some period of time, possibly still, the number of transistors packed on a fixed surface of silicon chip did double about every 18 months) is that semi-conductor manufacturers set something like it a goal. It is not true as a principle of comptuers got simply better by a factor of two every 18 months or whatever because even if there is a linear relationship between chip size and speed (halve the chip size halve the travel time for signals etc., ignoring switching speed, heat dissipation, need for faster storage/hard drives etc.), there is not necessarily a linear relationship between computation amount and outcome (I do twice as much arithmetic on my weather prediction that does not make it twice as accurate etc.), there is no guarantee how cheap it would be and so on (there is a formula relating computing speed and price, that is Grosch's law, economy is as the square root of price, to do something twice as cheaply it must be done four times as fast, so that suggests that a naive reading of Moore's law combined with Grosch's would imply a halving of the price of computation every 3 years).\r So Moore's law was more a myth for the R&D departments of semi-conductor firms, Grosch's law was the sales myth (and way more dubious).\n\r\n\"If I should die, think only this of me:\r\nThat there's some corner of a foreign field\r\nThat is for ever England.\" \"The Soldier\" Rupert Brooke, 1914\r\n\r\nI am not sure the idea that the land and its people are somehow intermingled is unique to indigenous/non-Western etc. cultures. Many xenophobic nationalists are called blood and soil nationalists etc. The trick is to implement the ideal of human connection to the land in some way that actually works to better human life. There is no telling if respecting indigenous sovereignty would help environmentally and no requirement that it do, rather it is a question of doing justice. Your argument gets dangerously close to suggesting there needs to be some external reason to recognize indigenous sovereinity outside of simple justice (ie it has to be good for something else) and I don't think that is a justifiable position.\r\n\r\nOn the CEOs of things like Exon being responsible for climate change. Sort of depends on how getting rid of them would make things better. Possibly we get rid of the CEOs, new individuals, councils, tribunes, parties etc. would arise to do the same work of extraction and nothing would change. Alternatively perhaps things would massively change perhaps oil extraction would stop and people would adapt to not having oil etc. highly efficient motor vehicles running off clean electricty, people moving close to work to make transport easier and people just doing without a certain amount of motorized transport and things like heating. How much of that not happening is CEOs being unwilling to stop oil production and how much is people who use oil not willing to make the sacrifices (buy new cars/switch to public transit, move, do without vehicles or heat etc.)? As far as I can see it is a complicated mix of the two. The benefits of the current systme may be very unevenly distributed but many still get some of them and it seems to me they are complicit.\r\n\r\nThe idea that everything is of a piece (a whole raft of issues are inextricably intertwined) is dubious in that it implies one that any improvement would require movement on all fronts. This could make the perfect the enemy of the good, just because treating one person's gunshot wounds from a police officer would not solve the broader problem of police excessive use of force that would not be a good reason not to do it, so with issues in climate change. Conversely the idea is also dubious because to me it implies that if there is improvement somewhere there would have to be improvement everywhere, but humans are notoriously compartmentalizing beings, I have no trouble believing that we could make progress on say climate refuge problems and fail to make headway on actually implementing policies to reduce green house gas emissions. It is like how we know we should not do X (stay up writing long Youtube comments) yet we keep doing it anyway. The idea that climate change issues are complexly, but probably at least somewhat extricably intertwined seems more likely to be the case...", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Allan Olley", "channel": "UC3vuhyywDTlJ2bJC5AKMVOQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTuajBGylTNH_GnA-0sm8oEw2_ixwxxkDyClppR=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugw1aTdUzgnTtiKP5ZF4AaABAg", "text": "From my experience I've found XR on a local level is perhaps more open to critique (and the critiques here are on-point) than at the level of national leadership (though said leaders might dispute that the are leaders and position themselves more as founders and spokespeople). I also think that the essays in 'This is Not a Drill' the Extinction Rebellion handbook by Mohammed Nasheed, Kamla and Bhuvan Chan Joshi and Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim are all serious good faith inclusions.\n\nWhile it may seem perverse to wish for any more white men in XR than there currently are, the issues you identify (esp w/r to the police) give me yet another reason to be sad Mark Fisher is no longer with us. With his participation in citizens' assemblies I have no doubt he would have been very involved in XR (especially here in Essex and Suffolk where I live) and would have done a good job at reminding Hallam, Bradbrook and Read (despite their various and different merits and strengths) that climate change is always already political and cannot be easily divorced from ideology in the name of a humanism that ends up being less inclusive in practice than in theory.\n\nWhich is not to say I don't support XR and won't continue to be very actively involved! Perfection politics can stop political action and I'd much rather be involved with something flawed but active than perfect but completely passive. But it's important for us in XR to remember that we're not reinventing the wheel and that a lot of the things we're saying have been said by other activist groups in the past and the fact that the police go light on us can't be wholly divorced from what some label \"identity politics\" don't think.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Adam Whybray", "channel": "UCs2yp1_DF-OvRFMFv0r4fEQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTOsbE_l5xPCzP6lneP1rHVPDmn4wrdOwl6w_mN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This video touches a little bit on it, and, while I think the points raised are valid concerns about the movement, I also think they may be unfair in some ways. First, XR is actually pretty heterogenous. There's the more established UK movement, but also XR groups in Europe and a rapidly expanding movement in the US. Even within the UK, US, and Europe, I think there is a lot of heterogeneity. Here in the US, each local and regional group has its own flavor and proclivities. Really the only thing that everyone shares is a commitment to the 3 (4 in the US) demands and the principles. The finer points regarding ideology and tactics do vary from person to person and place to place. Second, I know for a fact that in the US at least there is a lot of awareness amongst XR folks about the inseparability of climate change from colonialism, indigenous rights, migration, and labor as well as the history of other social movements and ideas and a lot of effort is made to integrate this into our practice.\n\n\nThat being said, not everyone in the movement is on the same page, and it's very hard to not only be aware of all of the things that we need to be aware of, but to actually incorporate that learning into our core aim, which is to pressure governments into responding to the crisis via non-violent rebellion.\n\n\nSo I'd love to hear some third party thoughts on the movement and what it's blind spots and weaknesses might be.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Gabriel S", "channel": "UC-F8VhrvZXVDu1lOTtG3UlQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRBVuY45jDINwjf3WeJ760-htoEsk5-NkzawqjTZQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes, there are some some right wing activists that are complete xenophobes, but by implying all of them are from just some is clearly the part to the whole fallacy. I could bring some left wing racists, that doesn't mean you are, that's just silly.\nAgain generalizing by saying the right wing politicians deny global warming, us politicians maybe, but that doesn't mean all of them do.\nI get that you are a communist and while I don't share your views, I am subscribed to your channel because I value different world views, since you can learn lots from hearing other opinions.

It just adds.... a LOT of weight to the extremeness of the law enforcement persecution of the protests.\n\nIt wasn't just Dakotas police at the protests.  Police were shipped in from a bunch of other states also.  My home state of Indiana, *1000 miles away*, sent officers to help police Standing Rock.\n\nThe significance here is that these are supposed to be domestic police forces, with geographically limited jurisdictions.  Indiana state police should have zero authority outside of Indiana.  This was land sovereign to the Native Americans by treaty, so it's bad enough that any U.S. domestic police force was invading it at all.  But it would be a smaller scale outrage if one shitty governor didn't understand or respect this and directed his own police forces to do this, and enough meathead officers didn't understand that this wasn't their land to police because it was within the borders of their state of jurisdiction.\n\nBut actually a whole bunch of governors banded together in solidarity over this and shipped forces to contribute to the oppression.  They seriously used their police forces as if they were militaries in an alliance to invade foreign land in a literal act of war, and there could be zero mistaking that there was any legality to it.  This just highlights how incredibly brazen it all was.  A blatant flouting of local, federal, and international laws by a huge number of high level government officials over ideological conviction against Native American rights and environmentalism.  It's.... astounding stuff.  Seriously.  In my mind, the shock and significance of the event is on the same level as 9/11 or the election of Trump, in terms of what it reveals about the state of things, and the USA's left should be in abject horror that Democrats/Obama were almost totally silent about it.\n\nAnd the pipe had a significant leak less than a year after it was built.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "SalmonGod", "channel": "UCgSZVF_hTooFa8Wh_0RSBLQ", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHCaqQXQ9wRwwkstZCJxqF4LbK1dGCElmFjbkK-g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I genuinely want to challenge the representation of fully automated Luxury Communism. Bastani's books issues are clear but the ideas that they center around is founded in the observation of our technological history, as well as Autonomist Marxist thinkers - Franco Berardi from what I understand from Novara being a key influence (might I suggest the Post-futurists Agenda, an essay of his, for an easy in to the ideas). These thinkers state that a technological solution to a lot of the worlds issues are, usually, the key to issues that face us as a civilization. Automation removing the need for work, AI eventually taking over the other jobs, finding a science driven solution to the climate issue. None of these things need to be founded in resource or Labor violations - production does not equal capitalism and all the many, many, many faults that system has. Honestly, when it comes to the climate, looking to the science community and taking there advice seems to be the way forward - they've been saying for years that a lot of societal and lifestyle changes need to be made and a lot of the fault falls at the doors of oil companies, the plastic industry and bid business in general. As for Moores law, I get it - he's wrong, companies use it to make themselves the new Lords and Saviours, but it's supposed to just be short hand for the rapid nature at which our technology is growing and through that growth growing even faster, which if we can change our society to a more moral one without sacrificing our great big tool use (wahay) that is science, then we'll be better for it. Your so right about the horrors of regresionist rejections of technology - I for one would be no where without my plad shirts - but might I entreat you to think about the world we could live in? One both Moral and, dare I say it, Luxirious - one lead by humanity ever increasing ability to make more complicated and advanced tools to lift up every thing. One where we can reach for post scarcity, banish disease, make people enjoy a life that is founded on a rejection of suffering and the best trick that human evolution provided us with.

But there is still a logical leap to imply that a decrease in transistor sizes will lead to solutions for all the problems of the world, the problem is with techno-optimism in general although there are also techno-pessimistic arguments against action on climate change as well. Moore's law is more about the consumer demand for semiconductor products as the size shrank to be more accessible to market production, in this regard the prediction was pretty spot on.

{"cid": "UgwK88UVC8wCf6EuYWl4AaABAg", "text": "While I often agree with what you say in your videos, I feel like there is a lot of language that isolates the audience. It seems as if you are only working with an intended audience who agrees with your viewpoints already and seems to be the case with a comment section that feels like an echo chamber of agreements. Your messages don‚Äôt seem to be as impactful if they are only heard from the same exact people. That also make people watch your videos for confirmation of their ideas instead of truly testing the validity of their ideas. It‚Äôs kind of like Prageru viewers only watching Prageru videos to confirm their beliefs.\n\nI only worry about this because it seems like politics are getting more and more partisan, where each side paints enemies and friends in black and white. I don‚Äôt think much can be done if one foot is working while dragging the other. If we want to solve environmental problems I feel like there needs to be more discussion with unifying politics instead of saying one political movement has all the correct solutions. Especially as time for environmental action is running out, there needs to be some cooperation with other groups that I can‚Äôt find in your videos.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôd be able to do it, but I feel like it would help to find a way to make your ideas more appealing to other political ideologies so the messages you are saying have more influence. While I share many of the ideas you say in this video, I always seem to word it very differently to friends and family who don‚Äôt share my views (like dealing with climate change by talking about global resource exhaustion, which has many similar solutions). If it can be shown that a lot of the issues that people from all sorts experience are actually the same, then I feel like communities and governments can work better with people that they would typically disagree with.\n\nMaybe this comment won‚Äôt get anywhere but I thought that I should get it out.

Yosemite was filled with ice up to the rim 13000 years ago. its been several large rises but two fifty foot major rises. most of its up to its limit unless green lands under ice dams give way that look like Yosemite but under ice . if you nuked Greenland you might get a ten foot rise in a year but it would goback down, when the bering opened up though it went big. 200 feet over 13000 years left civilization wasted each major rise. its killed more people then wars in the last 13,000 years that's why its a big deal. it caused the eden flood of the Persian gulf. if a meteorite hit green land or the antartic it woud be good for the coast. but as long as the bering straight it kept at a balance level like china helped it come to then we are allright. it took them thousands of years and millions of people to get close to right.

I don't mean in a merely derogatory sense, but in the sense that for that connection to be actually established the clock needs to be turned back on capitalism.  As marxist (correct person) I tend to think we need to move forward from capitalism, not try and turn back time to before the last contradiction. Medieval peasants had a connection to the land, but we shouldn't want to recreate feudalism. I know that's a bit of an edgy comparison, but the fundamental problem I have with the video is this:\nThings like the Standing Rock protest are great, but they serve only to try and preserve scraps of what capitalism and colonialism have already destroyed so thoroughly that it's impossible to return to a prelapsarian state. The vast majority of people can't live an indigenous lifestyle and therefore we need to create a new way of living that is nothing like the old and resolves the contradictions. Am I missing anything here?\n\n\nAlso, I'm struggling with the following thought: Native peoples have been and are being genocided, there's no doubt about that, but does that mean I must agree that they own any land? I get that one should respect sacred sites, but if we're talking about learning from indigenous ways of being in the world, should we really be glorifying the idea that something can belong to you because your ancestors lived there? It would be cool if First Nation Americans got all their land back, but would it also be cool if the fascists in my country started thinking about who can trace their lineage back to the Count of Flanders or whatever?\n\n\nMy thoughts on this are quite fuzzy and confused, so please let me know if I'm fucking up somewhere, hope to see this discussed in the stream.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "shinjinobrave", "channel": "UCCdU77ZM0iCtC0YFOQ2_ptA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQC3Pdfa478gC8uMvZznX2DTD-5VIZ-ogfROi1B=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And thank you for the resources to look further.\n\nA thing that really needs to be driven home is how humans, by definition as living, react to their external environment.  And this reaction includes how humans set the thermostat in their own homes.  Ideally, it is set to where a person is most comfortable, where the heat produced by one's body is at equilibrium with the loss of heat from their body to the surrounding environment. How we dress for outside is an extension, wearing extra layers when going out in cooler and cooler temperatures, or wearing clothes to block sunlight if one is going to be outside for a long time.  These simple basic things we do on a daily/yearly basis that literally shows how much we still respond to an environment that isn't just \"over-there,\" but literally outside and inside our homes, and even inside ourselves at a biological level.  It's not just being enmeshed in our environment that needs to be understood, but that we literally never live our daily lives outside of any environment.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "LardDragonEzra", "channel": "UCfEdNEWimemP0Io-URrFQGw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRW01HQIjAj6i5YpVhE4-hw7gkyYg1gUurIUrkSXQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

How do you expect us (in my case: Continental Europe) to let Indigenous philosophy lead the fight against climate change, especially as we try to establish coalitions to fight it locally? While we can and do learn from Indigenous philosophers, the ideas indigenous tribes have preserved against the onslaught of epistemological and physical Colonialism don't appear to be easily translatable into progressive philosphy here, where we do not have a concept of being bound to a land that is not reactionary. And quite honestly, I don't want to identify with this land. The task at hand is not one of deconstructing, which we've done over the last 50 years, we need a new conceptual way of thinking about ourselves and the kind of society we want to live in. I'd say we need do find the particular contradictions in how the nature-humanity dichotomy is constructed and find a way to transcend it that develops organically in our local context. And my guess is that a project of ecosocialism that's fueled by the wish for emancipation from the self-destruction that capitalism fuels could be such a project (though the devil will be in the details).", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Artur Yeon", "channel": "UCJfz65KVfHaQibCnMSUfihw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ19A1jq3mL3F59szbaCygMSY_yhAasNFgfCQCJIQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I think it really takes away from educating people on the issue by just alienating us from the video through these. Being positive about yourself and your sexuality is good for the individual, but I think this particularly fits into a different realm where you're involving people who weren't expecting it or opting in. Just as your viewers can have a parasocial relationship with an imagined 'you', I think you can have some sort of parasocial relationship with the imagined 'us'. I only really talk about it in this depth because frankly I feel this is a recurring issue I have with your videos, which are otherwise really quality imo.\n\n\non a different note.... I think climate grief, for me, is how I feel I won't ever get a life to live. I mean, as you discuss hyperobjects in the video I think I could think about this specific feeling I have as a result of a hyperobject in my own life. climate collapse is something out of my own hands, right up there with financial independence and a general lack of knowledge and skill relevant to how I'm supposed to navigate capitalistic society and survive in it. With that last point especially, a lot of people talk about how the world is changing at an exponentially rapid rate and I feel a consequence of that is that people's parents nowadays can't actually prepare them for what the world is like because it's alien to the one they grew up in.\n\n\nAs a consequence of all these interwoven problems specifically, I don't know if I'll be able to move out of my parents' house, if I'll be able to travel across the world to ever see my girlfriend in person, if I'll ever be able to transition and live in a body that reflects who I really am. If climate change destroys the world, I could run out of time. If capitalism isn't adequately subverted in the next 5-10 years, I might never be able to get an income. If I can't get an income, I could end up homeless or dead, never being able to be in a place of peace, never being able to hold my girlfriend close and tell her I love her. Suppose capitalism actually does get overcome before I die but climate collapse isn't prevented, I might be able to meet and maybe even live with the most important person in my life, and have a slow and painful end of the world hanging above our heads.\n\n\nso.... that's kinda it, isn't it? If the world doesn't become a significantly better place and fast, I'm already dead, and there's nothing I could ever have been capable of that could prevent that. That's my climate grief.

Or rather, a monoculture under the guise of multiculture (which means an ethnically diverse populace/workforce, racially 'diverse' but culturally interchangeable b/c their only cultural affiliation is the monoculture).

Fuck, even your rationale for that is consumeristic - he might want to try out the cold, sample it...an ecological perspective means you stop seeing people as fundamentally consumers, or automatons who buy things. Take that away - what logic remains for a Somali in Sweden? Or a Swede in Somalia?

Unfortunately, we are in a much different situation now due to negligence. Instead of us doing proper maintenance on the planet the thing may be irreparably damaged if drastic action isn't taken.\n\nI try not to lie when I talk to people about climate change, especially when I talk about sacrifices. Yes, if we really want to keep the planet from getting too hot there will need to be not only individual action but government action as well. We basically as it is need to create a new economy from thin air in order to keep this from collapsing. \n\nI don't think it's impossible or improbable that we can do it; America is really the only powerful country that wholeheartedly denies climate change at the moment, and many other countries are making moves to improve their footprint. Even massive polluters like China have made great improvements over the last half decade. And if world leaders care about the planet enough, no US leader would risk a unilateral embargo, because that may be what it comes to.\n\nBut it will take a lot of dollars to dig us out of this hole, US cooperating or not. there are a lot of often overlooked effects that are not discussed in many studies or used in models. Cloud generation for example is a more recent phenomena that is included in this analysis, and it could accelerate warming due to excess CO2 fucking with it and not allowing them to form to block out solar Rays.\n\nIf you want to make this easier, develop carbon CAPTURE techniques and technologies.

{"cid": "Ugwv9CAT9E_kxbz_63l4AaABAg", "text": "I really liked the focus on the interconnectedness of the problem - it's super complex, and separating the science from the sociology from the political etc is a really terrible strategy - and one that modern industrial society supports - tbh both capitalism and communism. If the aim is efficiency and production, no matter who it's owned by the most efficient way is for everyone to get really really good at their one skill - science, engineering, politics. Having polymaths, people who synthesise the information across specialities is far less common, because it's not efficient.\r The phrase \"jack of all trades, master of none\" upholds the idea that it's better to specialise, rather than to generalise. And sure, we need some specialists, but every single role being specialised? That gets us to a world where climate and border control and police violence are all separate issues. There are a few fields that are okay with that, at least academically - for example geography is kinda about blending the social, the scientific and the economic, but even then people specialise on one area - food security, or water quality, bc that's how both employment and academia work.\n\n\nI also really liked the stuff about indigenous philosophies, and the fact that the work of how to do this has already been started, and quite significantly so. If we see the environment as part of ourselves, and us as a part of the environment, then looking after it makes a lot more intrinsic sense. And that kind of identification is what creates the greatest behavioural action. Not awareness, but seeing the problem as a you-problem, a problem that directly affects you and that you can directly affects. Tangible, impactful, surmountable.\r\n\n\nIn terms of the video, I don't think the framing devices worked particularly well, and distracted rather than added to the video (the Attenborough stuff didn't work for me, and the Arsonist was less relevant than in other videos), and in general it was a bit messy, but there were some really strong and important ideas in there that I'm really glad are being discussed.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Caitlin Smith", "channel": "UCBQhpPh-xQqNPNKMja1O7PA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaKJBdipByQ_KRNMxHKLgYxj5OsX900NedT4HeJQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Olly introduces this idea of the category error at the start of the video, which gives us an example of getting a tour of a university, and then asking 'where's the university?' - something patently absurd, since as he says, the university is the buildings, people, and the work they do there. The problem from what I can tell, is that the video (and people broadly) commit what I'd call an inverse-category error in trying to solve problems like climate change. People get a tour of our society, through their various lenses of upbringing, socialistaion, and whatnot, and assign a 'we' to various in-groups, people with shared interests and so-on. Olly makes liberal use of this 'we' when addressing his audience. The difficulty is that under the extreme alienation and political power differences that neo-liberal capitalism and so-called democracy has brought us there is no longer any power behind this 'we'. 'We' cannot solve climate change, the category is bunk as a political entity of power. Those who could be included in it that have some semblance of power (police, military, others with shitty political beliefs) are not because they are alienated, separated from the rest of us in their in-groups that lick boots. Those who are included in it tend to be divorced from political power - which is how they came to what some would call 'radical beliefs'. Only they, the ruling class (which is an example of a group that is explicitly not an inverse category error) have the power to solve climate change, and it is directly against their (short term) class interests to do so.\ntl:dr: There is no 'we' that comprises a politically meaningful group.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "darkman1362", "channel": "UCOLE688r4IHbMCt-i7IQQKw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRuE8pOBBSniAuX0b0s7jnAsWe7xyoztc4jXg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

They knew roughly what sort of device that they needed to build, and the science behind it was sound and offered them guideposts. The science wasn't discovered mid-project. They also weren't tasked with the logistical demands that a green project would have to fulfill after the design was finished. \n\n\nOne thing that worries me - and is being slept on a bit - is that we don't have to wait 100 years for a global disaster as a result of warming. That is the global climate disaster, but along the way there will be ample possibilities for a global political disaster caused by climate change. This is not a time bomb that's going to blow up 100 years from now, but is instead a gradual fire consuming the planet that houses us. It won't be uniform, and along the way there will be localized crises. The thing about that is that when we look back at history, we find many examples of climate setting loose wars and rebellions; the effects of some of which are still reverberating to this day(like the French Revolution and the Dark Ages). Now, it's not that every disaster is going to have dire consequences of that sort, but every time one of these disasters hits - be it famine, hurricane, or some other crisis - we put a bet on the table and spin the wheel; some bets small and some big. Some of these bets will be swept from the table if our number doesn't come up, but some will stay there waiting for the next spin. We have an analogue for something of this sort with Syria. A mass exodus of people seeking refuge has emboldened the far right across the globe. We could see events of this sort as time goes on: again, and again, and again. This recursion will be occurring in the lead up to the climate tipping point. Within this we have several nuclear powers that like to play out chess games in flash points around the world. During the Cold War there was always the risk, albeit small, that the involvement of those foreign adversaries could escalate into a nuclear exchange. Ultimately, what drove the involvement of these governments were political agendas. What wasn't hovering over most of these conflicts were threats of scarcity. \n\n\nThis isn't a singular disaster that we're on course for. The probability of a major disaster will increase as time goes on. We cannot afford any half-measures. Achieving \"market based solutions\" shouldn't be of primary concern.

Being able to run bigger and more accurate models allows for better and more efficient designs. Without those computers, for instance, finding the materials you need to build efficient CO2 scrubbers might be impossible (you're basically relying on luck). And this applies to literally everything in science and engineering. Computers have been driving progress for the last two to three decades.\n\nSame with AI. ANN have existed since the 60s, what happened in the late 2000s to early 2010s is that compute power allowed for big models to be trained in a reasonable amount of time, making them a viable solution.

Sure, statistically if you introduce education and birth control (and capitalism) to areas of the world that currently have the highest rates of population growth, that growth will be curtailed. And I agree that people have a right to have kids if they want to have kids. But a lot of the time, that isn't financially viable, because of how expensive kids are and how frequently our society punishes parents for doing so through the imposition of extra costs and burdens on top of an already expensive process. That sounds like a thing we should fix, to me, so that both directions the choice is open.\n\nWhich will result in higher rates of childbirth than are currently the case in the countries that have those issues. Make it easier for people to have kids, financially, and they'll have more kids, statistically. If they don't, the people who DO want kids will have kids instead, and raise them with those values, and then their kids will grow up and so on. The people who want kids will always end up a larger portion of the population than those who don't. So either we figure out some process to restrict how many kids people have, or who has them, or both, or some other method of controlling the rate of reproduction, or we run into overpopulation problems. Ignoring that this is, or at the absolute minimum, could potentially become, a problem we need to put effort into figuring out an ethical and effective solution for, is inaccurate.\n\nThat said, I'm very much in favor of using genetic engineering to make sure children don't have to be born with disabilities whenever possible, and making that technology as cheap, effective, safe, and widely distributed as possible, and further acknowledging that a person's moral worth is independent and non-negotiable, regardless of physical, emotional, or social capabilities or lack thereof.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Rolepgeek", "channel": "UCc5mfQ5FzCuOaw_DCFshQHA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT0MLpjxbZceJNweiBaYoZcqb6Tj7aVujF5QlY2Vg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's not the scenario being discussed by OP of course, but I'm not fond of it as a hypothetical either. To expect support from the state, or the community, or what have you is not comparable in my view to expecting a single individual to do the bulk of the financial lifting. Such a comparison raises questions of liberal atomisation vs more community oriented childcare (I'm sure you've heard the old proverb \"it takes a village to raise a child\"), and distinctions such as the burden felt in supporting a child by one individual vs the community or state, and so on, but putting all of that aside it's a hypothetical that attempts to re-emphasise the descriptive, away from the normative, \"given existing conditions you ought to xyz\". From that perspective I find the framing of personal responsibility unhelpful, and an example of looking for a solution in the wrong place. I think it perpetuates a culture of attributing, and itself directly attributes, moral failure to individuals or groups for decisions that can be incredibly complex, have many factors that can influence the decision made, and deals in one of the most sensitive forms of personal autonomy.

I mean sure the burden itself is lessened on any one person, but the concept is identical. While living off of other people's money, you aren't living on your own means. By extension, neither is your kid. I think you're less concerned about that though because you see child rearing as something that should be more of a community effort.

There's nothing wrong with that per se, but... <see next part>\n\n\"Such a comparison raises questions of liberal atomisation vs more community oriented childcare\"\nShould people in general be forced to support other people's kids though? The village in that example does a lot more than just share the burden of caring for kids. Everyone does their part to provide for the community. Someone on welfare is by definition a recipient, not a participant. If she had a childcare job and actually was helping share the load, then there'd be no problem.

The reason I think the distinction of how hefty the burden is matters is because I prioritise the wellbeing of the child over this notion that no person ought to be required to part with some of their personal wealth to the end of caring for that child. I'm a communist, I object to the existing economic and social structure, and the ideology underlying it, the violation of which does not in and of itself concern me. What does concern me as a distinction in this metaphor is the material impact of requiring one individual to pay to raise a child that isn't theirs versus the material impact of doing so through the welfare system.\n\nI'm quite happy for everyone to be forced to support other people's kids. This is of course already partly done directly, and also indirectly in, for example, the education system. I very much consider a society that operates along the lines of \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" to be a desirable one. The very fact of existing in society means that we are functionally \"forced\" to do some things. Some people must work in order for society to function, there's no getting around that. The point is to maximise freedom for everyone. I do not consider a society that functionally prioritises the right of people with wealth to keep hold of that wealth over the right of those without wealth to have children should they so choose and for those children to be raised in a safe and healthy environment with access to the resources they require to be one that maximises freedom for all. This would take us into a complex discussion on different conceptions of freedom.\n\nNo, I'm not saying that moral judgements can't be made on something that was a complex choice. This particular comment refers specifically to the decision to have children and loses its meaning when abstracted from the rest of the comment. Of course, if one is abusive to their child to the point that CPS has to get involved this is morally wrong behaviour, but this doesn't relate to the decision to have children.\nMany of the burdens of having children in modern society - particularly the ones being discussed by OP eg poverty and treatable disease - are products of social structures and political economy, and/or are fixable from that framework.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "industrial society and its consequences have been", "channel": "UC2Uub5Y832NVRkHBV7VnJNQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/oz10yLVXcuYujNhrIiWlLlTAvC4fzfn4JwY0aWW9Yd8ulYp6Jbj2c66EEqGc4UWIsMLUE5tBRZY=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'm only 22, but I still remember a time when everyone used flip phones which you could use for calling, texting, and if you were really cool you'd have one that came with brick breaker. Now, for most people, if a phone isn't basically a pocket sized, touch screen, combination phone/computer/entertainment system it's considered basically junk. Back in 1961, Kennedy declared to the world we would land on the moon within a decade, and keep in mind humanity had only just put a man in to orbit for the first time that year! So we gathered our best scientists and engineers, rolled up our sleeves, and got to work. Eight years later we did it. Humanity has proven time and time again that with enough effort we can move mountains! It will be hard, for sure, possibly one of the hardest things we've ever done as a species, but so was the last thing we thought would kill us all, and before that it was a different thing, etc. The next hill will always be bigger than the last one, but we sure as shit didn't get where we are today by giving up and declaring a hill unscalable.

Engineers deal with highly integrated challenges literally on a daily basis. Regarding the harm, yes there are many species that have already gone extinct, which is very sad, but the bulk of the damage has not been done. On our current trajectory without any intervention that will start to change rather soon, but until then it is still very much in the category of things that are yet to happen. And if your argument is that it would take too much effort to reverse now and so we should treat it as inevitable, then again I go back to my original argument that this does not give the scientific and engineering communities enough credit. So many fields have seen literally unprecedented advancement in the last decade alone that if you step back for a second to fully appreciate it, it's truly mind boggling. It just doesn't feel like it's been rapid due to how we perceive time. A decade may feel like a lot but it's really not, and advancements are only getting faster. Technological development is, by nature, exponential. New technology facilitates the development of more, even newer technology. \n\nAll in all, the only argument I hear from everyone that takes the \"damage management\" approach as apposed to aiming for fully fixing things is that fixing things would be really really hard. It's not impossible. It may require incredible leaps across multiple fields, but the only things in this universe that are impossible are things that break the laws of physics, and rapidly changing our planet's environment for the better through deliberate manipulation is far from breaking the laws of physics. Will it be complex? Yes. Will it be costly? Very likely. Will it require a lot of energy? Probably. Is it worth it? Unquestionably.

We're talking about engineering the climate of an entire planet. But we have already proven humans have the capacity to enact changes on that scale, albeit so far only for the worse. As for living in science fiction? You are right. In fact we both are living in a world filled with marvels that not too long ago could only be found in science fiction. Now don't take that literally, I'm not basing my argument on facts from star trek or other sci fi classics, that would be absurd.\n\nSo far you and this video have only succeeded in provong that the problem is very very very difficult and to give up simply because a problem is difficult just simply isn't what humans do, at least not those looking to actually get things done. Your pessimism, and don't fool yourself, that's what it is, serves no purpose but to discourage yourself and others from even trying. In fact I would argue that it is actively unhelpful. There were those who once thought wireless telephones impossible, those who thought electric cars with decent range were impossible, those who thought landing on the moon was impossible. Then we did those things and so so much more.\n\nI do realize that, practically speaking, our capabilities are not infinite. So where, you might ask, do we draw the line? At what point do we stop toiling and declare the problem intractable? Well, given the scale of the predicted devastation of climate change if we don't fix things the answer to that is never. There is no limit to how much effort and resources we can throw at this before it becomes no longer worth it. Why? Well other than the obvious answer of self preservation I give two reasons.\n\nFirst, for future generations. Some of my fondest memories of my childhood are of going on portages with my dad in Algonquin park, sleeping under the stars, cooking over camp fires, etc. The idea that I might not get to share this experience with my own children some day and then they with their children, and so on, is too much for me to stand idlely by while it all withers away. As well, when it's my time to go, I want to know that I'm handing over a world that is in better condition than how I found it.\n\nSecond, for past generations. This might sound confusing at first but my logic is fairly straight forward here. My grandfather did not crawl on his stomach through minefields up the boot of Italy during WW2, watching his friends and comrades explode merely a few feet away, to save the world from fascism simply to have our generation give up on it all because things got too hard. Climate change is a problem the same way the Nazis were a problem. The Nazis couldn't be managed, mitigated, or slowed down. There wasn't an acceptable amount of Naziism deemed safe. There were two options: stop them dead or die trying. There was no option for giving up. And by god they fucking did it! So when I die and see my grandfather in heaven, unless I can say that we put in an effort equivalent to crawling on our stomachs through a field of undetectable shoebox mines in full gear and under fire, then we will not have tried hard enough.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Max K", "channel": "UCpUrbD9hVaGcBcZy55ZAuEg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRmzqeYcHjTEo0dtyyNUE8nJBF5wu7QoBmZgbcSIw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Over-population should indeed be a concern but not an immediate one which means anti-natalism is the answer for those who actually care about the issue.  Anybody who is in favour of killing people to keep the world's population down is probably racist.  Wanting to not have kids to stem that problem is the opposite of that.\n\nJonathy James - We like to think of each economy as being separate but that hasn't been true for a long long time.  Canadian software developers earn more than 8 times as much as Indian software developers (just choosing my own field as an example).  So many companies choose to outsource over hiring locally.  Doing so feeds 8 times as many people so I've never been able to get upset over losing jobs to outsourcing, but that does mean that for every 8 people who get a job over there 1 does not get a job here.  Yes it means more local unemployment but it also means that the fewer people we have here the more people we can feed there (and vice versa).  Global population will always be a global issue.\n\nTheFirstTime - Democracy is better than Fascism.  Socialism is better than both Communism and Aristocracy (which is what completely unregulated capitalism inevitably leads to).  Where socialists and libertarians should agree is that getting the money out of politics is absolutely essential to retaining any semblance of freedom.

This whole meme of people being stomped out in the name of \"SOCIAL PROGRESSION\" is reminiscent of the history of colonial imperialism on a whole.

Your reference to mountains and rainforest is irrelevant. There was still far more than 100x as much land available as could ever have been needed. The notion that Europeans came over and just started fighting for land is a myth. Land was never scarce. Only conquistadors waged anything that could be described as genocide.

Nothing you stated in your response makes the original point which I was responding to any less irrelevant. \nIn short, there was already more than 100x as much inhabitable land available as was necessary, but despite this abundance, the native Americans still waged war on one another over territory.

And if genocide was ever the goal, why was it never achieved? The closest thing to genocides had already occurred in the 2nd and 3rd wave, carried out by people mistaken for the original \"First Nations.\" And even then, most of their disappearance has been due to gene mixing, hence Mexico.

We've been reading and hearing and even seeing, supposedly with our own 2 eyes, this deforestation for DECADES. And with only increasing clarion alarmism in the same period, mostly about climate change, previously known as global warming, previously known as global cooling... Despite all this, up until this latest firestorm in the Amazon a few weeks ago, the latest reports were that the planet is becoming not only greener, but more rapidly than ever recorded. It's almost like nature is compensating despite how hard we try to fuck things up. Nature always wins. Tangible pollution remains as alarming as ever though. But all this ambient fear mongering almost always turns out to be unfounded. Senseless waste bothers me, but that also extends to the waste of concern. People will give up concerns altogether if it is continually wasted. Look at Africa. We now have a well established phenomenon known as Africa fatigue, which is the near total lack of concern for all the mayhem and horror that happens in Africa because people have simply tuned it out, either due to exhaustion or priorities, or even saddest of all, boredom. Al Gore told us Miami would be under water in 10 years... back in 2006. Thanks to his lies, how the fuck am I ever going to convince ANYONE who heard his mania that THIS time they really need to be concerned about an inch per year? It will take DECADES and DECADES to even begin resembling anything like what he warned we'd be well under by now. It may take the entire century. In geological time scale, that's a blink of an eye.

This is a fact. If people who work the land understand it better than the media, then it would also make sense to say that I know better about my country than foreign people on youtube comments, right? According to INPE, the national institute for area survey, the amount of deforestation  on july 2019 grew 279% if compared to july 2018. When bolsonaro knew about this data, instead of facing the facts, he fired (pun unintended) the leader of the institute. bolsonaro got elected with a discorse that included the supression of ambiental law and is clearly aligned with the agropecuary indrusty. Our environmental minister is a climate change negationist, and got convicted for illegaly selling public land  for companies while he was ambiental secretary ofthe state of S√£o Paulo.

I'll address the bit that was to me, but you can ask me to respond to the rest as well if you'd like. First, I'll need a clarification. \n\n\"climate change is solely due to the most developed nations, but simultaneously that ballooning populations, specifically among these particularly wasteful nations, is welcome?\"\n\nWhat do these statements have to do with each other? Developed nations are the biggest contributors (note, not the sole reason) to climate change because they don't have policies that reflect the intricate effects of fossil fuels and other pollutants. For instance, gas is cheap to drill and transport, but basing the price on just that, as we currently do, pushes the climate change costs to other sectors that actually feel the effects. For instance, the fishing industry that PT mentions at the start. So developed nations need to better tweak their free market policies to actually align with the physical effects of products (i.e. chemical plants can't dump their byproducts into rivers for this same reason).\n\nI'm confused what immigration has to do with this though. PT points out that people in the fishing industry hire illegal workers to subject them to poor conditions to turn a profit in an industry suffering from climate change. Is that what you're referring to?\n\nFirst we need to fix how the fishing industry (and many others) has to pay for the fossil fuel industry's byproducts (yes, I'm aware this will be passed on to consumers, who ultimately are the people polluting), then we need to fix our immigration laws so that employers can't use them to subject people to insane conditions under threat of deportation, then we need to fix labor laws to allow employees better leverage against abusive employers. Or something along those lines. Make sense?\n\n\"Wasn't this exactly what the New Zealand mass murderer and El Paso shooter were obsessed with redressing?\"\nTo be honest, I don't know much about them. While I'm open to discourse, it's hard for me to pay attention to someone after they do something like that. It's too late to disarm with dialogue at that point.

{"cid": "UgyllJbKuWGOhKf1Ih14AaABAg", "text": "This is something I have been thinking on for quite some time. I think the first mistake people make is to seperate our minds and our bodies. It is not strange to think of our bodies as part of the land. From dust we come and unto dust we will go. But then we seperate out bodies and minds by seeing them as different, that our minds are higher beings that can go on without our bodies. Thus our minds become seperate from the land. Weirdly enough the importance of the mind and body being the same was initially something I thought about in the context of mental health. I have Autism Spectrum Disorder and I wondered if I had a soul, would it was autistic? My autism is something that effects me on every level from the way I talk to how I process sensation to the sensitivity of my stomach. It is a condition of both my mind and body, and I don't know who I would be without it. In most if not all philosophies that involve a seperation of soul and body disease and disability are features of the body that do not transfer to the soul. If they did, that would make my soul, and the souls of anyone else with a mental, intellectual or emotional disability diseased souls? If they aren't would we become entirely new people when we die? To many people the concept of our minds being totally the same as our bodies, and will die along with them is horrible. But to me it is reassuring. I know who I am, and that there is not a secret person hiding in my 'soul'. \n...and that's how a train of thought can link climate change, mental health and religious philosophy.

Instead, the heat produced by compostation in industrial compost plants can be used to heat homes in an environmentaly friendly way, or the compostable waste can be fermented and in the process, electricity can be produced.

Dumps also use up a lot of space and harm the environment by sealing up more surface. More trash = more loss of open land. If we're talking incinerator, the energy in the compost can produce electricity, but the nutrients are still lost or contaminated and difficult to separate from the toxic ash of the other waste. Also, all the energy is released as CO2, while in compostation less CO2 is released because some of the organic matter is consumed by the mikroorganisms doing the composting.

It'll essentially convert to soil, upon which the dump is sitting in the first place. I don't think compost adds an appreciable overhead to dumps.\n\n\"And even if you're composting in your backyard, compost earth is incredibly fertile and can be used instead of conventional fertilizer that always risks having adverse effects on the environment (like contaminating drinking water).\"\nCompost and fertilizer are made of basically the same stuff. If fertilizer can contaminate drinking water (it has tons of nutrients for algae and bad stuff to grow), then so can compost (has the exact same nutrients).\n\n\"all the energy is released as CO2, while in compostation less CO2 is released because some of the organic matter is consumed by the mikroorganisms doing the composting.\"\nUntil the microorganism population saturates for a given compost vessel, in which case it's all back to full CO2 conversion. Then when all the microorganisms eventually die, what little carbon they locked up becomes released all over again. It's a zero sum game.\n\nI think the only valid reason for composting is generating fertilizer in-situ rather than having to always create more fertilizer, the process of which consumes energy to create and distribute. Not to downplay that reason at all though; it's a really good reason.

{"cid": "UgyxGk4PvC5tKc0J0up4AaABAg", "text": "I try not to read a lot about climate change, to be honest. Particularly a lot of the theory around it is horribly depressing. This isn't the first PT that's caused me to pick up a cited book, but it's the most painful picking it up has been for me.\n\nI am not a total pessimist where it comes to the climate crisis. Now, more than ever, there are clear steps that can be taken to mitigate and reverse it. I will list them now:\n- $100 is the amount it costs to pull one ton of CO2 out of the air, right now. It is the most expensive form of CO2 reduction. It is also the amount, per ton, of the Swiss carbon tax. Price carbon at over $100/ton, and the market incentive to end emissions in your country completely, right now, will already be present. Spend all of that money on mitigation, spend $100/ton on pulling tons of carbon out of the air, if you have to. Drive your jurisdiction; country, state, province, canton, oblast, or wherever; to carbon-negativity, right now.\n- Establish a jobs-matching program and a permanent employment insurance fund for anyone laid off due to climate mitigation, to abate economic impacts and keep steady funding going towards change. Pay for college and lodging for people who want to shift careers. These will both raise overall productivity anyway.\n- Dump lots and lots of money into researching the curtailment of pollution in industrial processes, effectively regulating pollution, and getting curtailment methods out to the broader industry. Pressure the developed nations to follow suit. Pressure China and India and Brazil and Russia and Malaysia to follow suit, but vitally, do it yourself first, because the west contributes more than anyone to climate change, and is also uniquely positioned (you know, having the greatest engineering resources and regulatory access to most of the world's top polluters) to intervene. The international community will not take any tut-tutting on the climate seriously until the western countries have actually succeeded at doing better than the countries they tut-tut.\n\nHowever, this is a monumental effort and demands global consensus recentre around an avowedly left-wing perspective. As Ollie mentioned, there is no ultranationalist's solution to the climate crisis. There is only a fascist's instinctual opportunism. As Ollie mentioned, there is no neoliberal solution, as neoliberalism is characterized by a pathological unwillingness to intervene directly in the economy; certainly not in ways that could hamper productivity, such as improving labour and migrant rights, applying regulation effectively, or protecting the sustainability of life on Earth. So I'm not totally pessimistic, but I'm pretty pessimistic.\n\n\nI am fairly confident in what I believe needs to be done, and how I believe it can get done, but I still avoid thinking about the climate. Lately, it has become an increasingly inevitable personal anxiety. I think this may be why so few people, even people accepting of the reality of the climate crisis, are willing to see it in perspective, and do what they must. It involves a not negligible sacrifice, and that is disquieting to a populace that already lives by sacrifice. Conscious of it or not, alienation is incredibly taxing on everybody, and it is easier not to think about one more huge anxiety cloud.\n\n\nJust like my grandmother, who is going to die if she tries to keep living on her own for much longer, we need to acknowledge the legitimate source of our anxiety, and face reality anyway. Hundreds of millions or billions of people will die young, depending on what we do now. Their deaths will be preceded by a long period of escalating suffering, possibly war.

{"cid": "UgyMPeF9Ok-itIY3Os14AaABAg", "text": "The points about police are interesting, but I feel like they only work in places like the U.S. or UK, but not in the likes of Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, there's been violence, of all types, but I trust them much more than the alternatives. We can change their minds and hold them accountable and so on, but the Provos or UVF or any of the paramilitaries are none of those things.\n\nWe can, in short, reform the police, or even revolutionise them- but getting rid of them, like in the Little Rock example, is a horrible idea here. If I say idealistic or optimistic, that will give the wrong impression- getting rid of police here in Northern Ireland will mean the restarting of the Troubles. There is no 1% chance it will turn out alright.\n\nThe problem with ACAB arguments is if you hear about their schemes for decommissioning old paramilitary weapons or engaging with still-active paramilitaries who have taken to dealing in drugs and murders, you start to realise the actual front-line officers are a tiny part of the police system. Yes, it enforces the current system of capitalism and colonialism. But while that's a part of their function right now, it doesn't have to be forever. Under the police system, we have strategies for dealing with domestic and intimate partner violence- that's not a bad thing. We have them defending corporations who bought the right from the government to build on a piece of land they shouldn't be allowed to- that's, and I hate to say this, them doing their job. We should be blaming the Government for the system they make the police enforce, and yes, we should hold the police accountable for the way they enforce it, and seek to change it, but blaming them for enforcing a morally bankrupt ruling is stupid. \n\nImagine you're in court. There's an innocent person being investigated for murder. After all the evidence is heard, it is clear they are innocent. But for some reason the judge (usually a jury, but this is a metaphor) sentences them to life in prison. The bailiff takes the innocent person away, and while taking them out, grabs and shakes the person in a violent manner. The bailiff badly hurts the innocent person.\nWho is at fault, and for what? The judge is at fault for the bogus ruling, the bailiff is at fault for their treatment of the person, and the bailiff's office is at fault for hiring a violent bailiff and for letting violent treatment be used. I don't see how the bailiff's office could be responsible for the bogus ruling which, in this metaphor, is the morally bankrupt system of capitalism and colonialism.\n\nIt's fitting that the video should mention John Oliver, because I'm reminded of a line of his where he says something to the effect of \"if I told you Margaret Thatcher liked to kick puppies in her spare time, it would (probably) be false without being out of character.\" The important thing is that going after a murderer for littering is pointless. We aren't going to fix capitalism or police brutality by abolishing the police (except in the broad sense that making murder legal drops the number of crimes committed). We have to fix it by having the right philosophy guiding the police force.\n\nMaybe you meant to imply not that we should get rid of the police or replace them, but that we should change them, and if so, great. But playing into the ACAB argument is deeply concerning- it mostly comes off as quite anglocentric- I would trust Northern Ireland's armed police over London's unarmed police (although if I understand correctly, they are sometimes armed). Anglocentric isn't the right word for \"focussing on England and America as if they're representative of places like Northern Ireland or Scotland which have totally separate experiences,\" but it's the same idea- you're paying attention to the police in London and the US, which are undoubtedly the worst, without considering the other countries where police exist and aren't total bastards. It's taking a point about US police violence and explaining a philosophical basis for police in general- that they reinforce the system (sidenote: no shit. All institutions reinforce ideas or systems, it's making them reinforce the right ones that's the interesting question).\n\nI'm in a climate group, for example, and we've never been attacked by police in Northern Ireland. We keep getting pressure from the London fucks to mask up at protests and stupid shit (obviously a balaclava isn't going to go down well in NI). Yes, they're campaigning on the same issue as us. But if they sacrificed thirty virgin's to stop climate change, it wouldn't make it okay. Similarly, I think insisting that working inside the system is impossible and we need to tear it all down is a privileged perspective- we don't have the luxury of looking at community policing as a good thing in Northern Ireland. We don't have the ability to say \"this doesn't work, let's stop\" because destroying the Northern Irish establishment would mean a massive power vacuum terrorist groups would be all to willing to fill. The Troubles could restart (if you ever think they stopped, you might be tempted to call this a cease-fire rather than peace).\n\nI hope you read this Olly, and I especially hope you think about it for your stream autopsy on the video. Because in your video about sex work, you were all too willing to touch on Northern Ireland, and while there is obviously time constraints that apply to talking about police for maybe three minutes versus sex work for thirty, I feel like the topic could've done with more nuance than you gave it, or at least a more open acceptance that the experiences of XR in London and NODAPL in the US don't necessarily reflect the experiences of others.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Markus Aldawn", "channel": "UCz6v8B7xEr4KBtVpSnrMdqA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShDOa2WNjg0pDORtkA43X3JrOrzW3yqlrq9KbASw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugymx3uWHG8XvoHL7TZ4AaABAg", "text": "Gotta say, the Arsonist returning to blame immigrants for fires was beautifully done. Lots of production value in this one. loved it.\n\nThe philosophical premise, that people moving to a town, meeting, having kids, that then die there in the polution would be better off then if the plant had not been built causing them not to exist has some issues.\n\n1. It assumes it is better to exist (Individually) even in suffering, then to never have existed. I would argue along the same line, that the people who came to exist are harmed, while those who do not exist are not harmed, as they cannot be harmed because they don't exist.\n\n2. If those people didn't move to that town, had not met and not had children there, they would have lived somewhere else. In this other place they would have also met people and had children that then did not grow up in pollution and harm. So as a species, we would in the one scenario have a similar nr of people living as in the other, only the overall wellbeing would be higher. \n\n3. The example fails to account for the longterm harm caused by the plant to people outside that town, on an infinite timeline.\n\n\nI loved the presentation of how everything is connected, I do think it could do with more highlighting. Perhaps that problem even deserves it's own video.\n\nThere were moments where the serious issues and the parody segments flowed into each other in ways that perhaps undermined the message. a message which is both massively important and for most people quite complicated. I have been in many discussions with many people in many fields who structurally fail to understand the hollistic nature of problems. Be it in medicine, with a doctor treating a systemic genetic disfunction by looking at the problem one organ or joint at a time, treating me like a car where if you have a flat tire, you change the tire. Same with climate change, things aren't black and white. Plastic is bad for oceans but had a way smaller carbon footprint then any of its alternatives. Straws are bad for sea turtles so we must ban straws. I am then that person who asks how the hell a sea turtle is drowning in straws? (plastic fishing nets are actually half of all plastic in the ocean. straws are less then 0.3%) What are we doing with our garbage? Why are we banning plastic to stop people from throwing it in the ocean? Isn't there just a problem where we sell our plastic garbage to foreign nations, ship it halfway over the world were they sort it into what they can use and then burn or dump the rest?\n\nPeople want easy answers. Those don't exist because what you say is true, these issues are all connected. From Nazis to pollution to internet data mining to privacy laws to Brexit to trump to Russia to police violence to racism to healthcare to gun violence. It's all one shitpile of disgusting spaghetti. It's all connected and interconnected, like an organism with many limbs. It's the optimal outcome of a failing system that is resulting in our evolutionary dead end. This is our great filter, this will be why we will never travel the stars and transcend our selfish existence on this spinning rock.\n\nI have my own climate change despair. It's not that I do not think that there is anything we can do. It's that I fully expect that we will choose not to. Because that would be consistent with all current trends. The reason we won't will not be that we can't, it will be that we will not be of sufficient will to change the things that will need to change. Right now there are forces in this world dividing us and sewing the seeds of polarization, keeping us at each others throats. We can't even agree on what caused a Nazi with outspoken Nazi views and many rightwing stochastic terrorists on his news feed and free acces to automatic rifles to commit a mass shooting. Hell we can't even agree on that insuline shouldn't cost 300-700$ per month. (it costs about 20 euros per liter here btw). If we can't agree on these very simple things, not even their underlying issues, then how the hell are we going to move our governments to go against the best interests of their richest supporters and do what must be done to save our planet?\n\nMy lack of faith is not in science, it's in humanity.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Evelien Heerens", "channel": "UCendoBFFSDDl4sciDRd_15w", "votes": "282", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTc6KEpqLWQ9_S0BMBiG384Y1M9QMqDDB1_Pw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

You will never hear a staunch capitalist talk about \"trickling down\". It's basically a strawman.

An economy is a closed system. There's a finite amount of currency. Simply shuffling money doesn't raise its value in the least. I also think you're wildly over simplifying what causes recessions. Furthermore if there are so many empty houses why aren't the owners renting them out to poor people at a price they can afford? A house rented out way below market value makes some money. An empty house makes no money. So even from the owners perspective it makes no sense to leave it empty...unless of course it's not actually empty at all, in which case it just sounds like you're advocating taking away someone else's property because they're not using it in a manner you like.\n\n> Those who do the least work have the most means.\n\nYes. Do you know why? Because they provide the factories. I cannot afford a factory or equivalent. Therefore if someone does not provide one I cannot produce any value whatsoever.

The Arsonist's coy reference to the 14 words was appropriately chilling. The criticism of police is appropriate, and I personally would expand that to criticism of the justice system as a whole: the law exists for the purpose of protecting the wealthy and powerful and oppressing everyone else.\n\nI also appreciated the exploration of climate change as it relates to Native Americans. I'm a Mississippi Choctaw, but as soon as I read the article with Nick Estes you mentioned, I realized that, yes, \"Indigenous people are post-apocalyptic.\" What a revelatory observation that was for me! It's given me a lot to consider.\n\nThings I Did Not Like:\n\nBeing not a fan of self-reference in the first place, I didn't find the nature documentary framing device all that engaging. I found myself sitting through it, kind of embarrassed, while I waited for more discussion of philosophy. You don't have to insert self-deprecating asides to justify a discussion of philosophy. You can just talk philosophy. It's why I'm here.\n\nI worry about the Arsonist's popularity. I read a lot of comments from people who seem to like him a little too much, and I wonder if you might have inadvertently created a \"Draco in Leather Pants\" situation with him. The danger with satirizing evil people is that there always ends up being some unintentional endorsement of evil -- for example, some elements of American History X, though the film is critical of Nazism, are used by neo-Nazis to promote their agenda. I suppose, in the face of global chaos and possible mass extinction brought on by climate change, my concerns about the Arsonist are really only minor ones, however.\n\nI don't give a damn how problematic Tolkien is; I'm going to quote him here because I like his work and because, despite everyone's best efforts to destroy the world, I want to believe that it's still a place worth living in:\n\n\"Despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt.

There will be a terrible battle between good and evil, and rivers of molten metal burning the world. But good will win, and the end is not an end: the Zoroastrian apocalypse is called 'Frashokereti', which roughly translates to 'making wonderful'. The end is the beginning of something new and wonderful.\n\n\nThe biblical and Islamic apocalypses are both a terrible end and a hopeful beginning. Revelation 21:1 \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.\"\n\n\nOf course, unlike the Zoroastrian and biblical, in our climate change apocalypse, the new wonderful world will be not come about by itself, or be imposed by an almighty power.

I kind of keep on living for the idea that society will be here in 10 years so that I can get top surgery and testosterone, and hopefully bottom surgery for trans men will have improved by then so that I won't be dysphoric with the result. And the idea that in less than 20 years it's all just going to disappear is terrifying. That would mean I'm stuck in this body at least partially for the rest of my life. Not to mention the love of my life who lives in the UK which is quickly becoming very isolationist, so who knows if he'll be able to get to me in time before the world ends.

Do you find that it is different to nationalist ideas of colonial Americans for example? Like you say, because they've occupied the land for hundreds of generations, they know it well and are better at sustaining it, which is a good point that I didn't think of before. What interests me though is whether indefensible people are only concerned about their own plight, and whether or not they are apathetic to other indigenous people and their connection to other lands. My worry is that if we adopted the \"protect the land you are connected to\" attitude, no one would adequately protect land like the arctic and Greenland (with much smaller indigenous populations) which could destroy the planet. One of the biggest issues with climate change (imo) is that people in wealthy, \"safe\" places don't care about the threatened areas of Bangladesh and Yemen because  they don't feel a connection to those places like they do to their own land. Is it possible for separate indigenous people to cooperate to protect all land, rather than just act to protect their own?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Joe Alexander", "channel": "UCi7WDNsUzjTKFoPKH8-Yxgw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTlgRVhxJXJUWHHz3FSrVvef0D0e7vqdcbH9jBsYQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx5ztkbfW3QM8vnLtJ4AaABAg", "text": "I've finally ended up at Hannah Arendt. I became interested after listening to interviews with Paul Mason taking about his latest book 'Clear Bright Future: A Radical Defense of the Human Being'. I had been struggling with how to think about here concept of 'The Banality of Evil'. I had previously been bashing the sh*t of out existentialism for how poorly it has been used I think to treat LGBT people. And also the psychological profession of the 20th century - for example the Nazis on trial at Nuremburg were I think assessed as being 'Normal' (I guess supporting Hannah Arendts conclusions in her Eichmann in Jerusalem)...  and yet the same profession basically killed Alan Turing for simply being gay.\n\n\nBut I want to get past my reservations about existentialism. And instead concentrate on the criticism of capitalism they had. Got going with Gabriel Marcel's approach of 'Qualities vs Functions' (I have an engineering background so 'functions' was something I could easily realate to - also 'Full Metal Jacket: \"What is your major malfunction?\".\n\n\nSpent months trying to understand Marxism and Marxist economics (I think the problem I had was that the problems Marx was pointing to are actually more obvious than you may think). Which I can tie into 'functions' by understanding that capitalists are basically trying to reverse the common sense 'design process' by starting with 'solutions' ('final solutions' I guess) rather than people's intrinsic 'needs' (from each according to their need...).\n\n\nThe trick for me has been to get away from the cliche of 'Quantities vs Qualities' and instead (like I said already) to think in terms of 'Qualities vs Functions' - this way a Quantity just serves as part of the overall function, like for example the grading of people's pay based on functions rather than the quality of what they do. I am basically saying here that 'functions' serve as 'roles' - for example in a top down heirarchy, with job titles and company departments etc. And in effect 'qualities' are the antithesis of 'functions' - where qualities cut horizontally across job titles and company departments...  In a business this could be like the work of a product line manager liaising with different departments to ensure product quality from inception to its final realisation - so called 'product project teams'. The corporate term for this would be a 'matrix dual power structure' - employess would basically have TWO bosses, with one boss focused on replicating the company hierarchy at the expense of their customers, with another boss who is focused on their costomers at the expense of the replicating the company hierarchy...\n\n\n...I guess in society Politicians could serve as the horizontal influence on the top down structures of business? I don't know a lot about anarchism, but this seems similar to the concepts of anarchist 'dual power structures' (for example providing services for poor communities).\n\n\nI finding this interesting to combine with network theory as well (for example the work of Paul Erdos) - such as the analysis of the alternative influencer network on youtube, which showed that roughly twice as much attention was given to the biggest influencers. This is quite useful for showing how different societies function: from everybody knowing each other and being friends with each other in an equal society, to an 80:20 distribution rule where a poverty divide develops along with marginalisation, to a full on dictatorship where all the focus is on one powerful individual while everyone else is socially isolated (perhaps in a patriarchal system) and desperately poor...   And here Karl Marx applied his material economic analysis...  so this is useful for debunking Jordan Peterson for example.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "This account is dead", "channel": "UCFLWZnMuvtExzGKJmHyR9eQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRRteeedVcgSZ1OfHS1FbLE9vsD8ZidMk7ijemp8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The priest costume was probably the most gorgeous and aesthetically inspired costume in any of your videos yet, the Attenborough framing device was hilarious, the Arsonist cameo was chilling, and the final line about the meaning of the word \"apocalypse\" was incredibly poignant. \nI think the Arsonist works amazingly well as an overarching villain for your videos, and this video actually explains why that is: all of this shit, all this terrible stuff you talk about, is all connected, and is all, largely, being done by the same people. The Arsonist symbolizes the same thing as the fish question at the beginning - he can be used to draw a direct line between fascism, capitalism, the \"pro-life\" movement, climate change, and probably anything else you ever feel the need to talk about. \nThe theme of hope in the face of despair and fighting for the future with hope is incredibly important to me, and I think a lot of people on the left scoff at hope and wrongly see it as some kind of self-deception that tells people that everything is going to be alright and they don't need to do anything, but I think that's not what hope is - hope means that everything CAN be better, IF we do something about it. It doesn't mean \"there's no need to revolt because things will work out\" - it means \"the revolution can succeed\". \n\nOn a lighter note, I really really love Revolution Lover and was so happy to hear it in the credits! \n\n\n...On an even lighter note, was the Arsonist's police portrait on the newspaper SUPPOSED to look like Keith from the Try Guys or was that just an accident?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "cvrc11", "channel": "UCMDHLP5_OyBsJrrgTVV5B_A", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTpHiq4hfMPZVQqth_FDjnUk40dQ_yONRzyRPFz=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx_7IkpqfIq_AgjMRt4AaABAg", "text": "Part of me grapples with concepts of ecology (as in the analysis of species in their environments) as applied to humans.\nThere the specie's drive for reproduction, there's the niche (in case of humans basically the entire planet) and there's the resources within that niche. This results in an exponential growth curve that eventually flattens and sometimes decreases. The size of the population eventually damages the niche. \nSo is this where we are at? Clearly earth has finite resources. Did we reach the end of the growth? does this manifest through the fact that we are damaging our niche? Do we even havs any control over our behaviour?\n\nAnd this leads me to my favorite intersection: climate activism, biology and feminism. Because one thing that makes us special is the fact that we learned to control our biology, and in particular our own reproduction. Free, educated, empowered women often have less children. It happens not through externally applied rules, but through free will of some sort. So maybe what will slow our population growth won't be the ecological niche's limits or the ressources running out, but instead women being empowered to do more than just have children. I really don't believe in the chinese approach to limiting numbers children, instead I want more women everywhere in the world to have better education, better perspectives, better rights and better access to health care.

{"cid": "UgwD91UXyZHYiKjUZ754AaABAg", "text": "I think the fundamental shift in understanding that needs to come about for climate change to be addressed, in a world where the utopic dream of bringing down the perpetrators and all moving forward into a brighter future together does not happen, is not only that we are part of the environment but that our lives have no greater value than anything else in the world. Furthermore, this is not to say that life is fundamentally valuable, but rather to lower the value of human life to that of any creature: our value comes arguable only as a species (and therefore unique), not as individuals. The life of a human that commits acts against nature contrary to the wider consensus (illegal fire starting in the amazon, poisoning of predators for cattle grazing, dumping of toxic waste or excess emissions) should not be seen as more valuable than the nature they destroy. Perhaps the farmer in Brazil has good reason to do what he does, or finds himself forced into it by the ever greedy market for cheap beef, but his livelihood and the chance of raging wildfires should not be weighed equally: better that millions if not tens of millions of humans (whatever part of the world they come from) suffer a restriction in freedom, relocation or death than the continued destruction of our world take place. \nThe choice, it would seem to me, lies between a restriction of one's own freedom (one's society i mean); the restriction of other's freedom (country x will be carbon negative so that country y can be carbon positive); or praying that the god Technology solves the issue for us. The creation of a kind of government where the people would willingly allow their lives to be forcefully changed seems nigh impossible to me; no self respecting country coming to terms with its role in colonialism would see itself once more oppress others in order to continue their carbon rich lifestyle; and praying to technology seems like no plan at all. So unless reforming human society as we know it, and having time to implement those changes on a global scale, can occur before 2030 I argue that any act of violence committed by any country, any individual, in the name of stopping/curtailing/reducing the effect of human's on the global environment is at least of moral character.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "wilfrid armstrong", "channel": "UCh0jtJK6WKtsG8rey3BRyjA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkW0wX_PTM27bNl0utownQ9f1bTp_Q97jdRG3vyg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It may be too late to revert the process entirely and it's most certain consequences, but it is very possible to try to work out those consequences in the least damaging way possible for human life. And I firmly believe that there's no other way to solve this other than leaving capitalism behind us, it's about resolving the \"subject x object\" dialectic, as Marx used to put it, ie the separation between humankind and nature mentioned in the video, or in other words, it's about the development of humanity's \"species-being\" as something \"for itself\" as Marx also used to put it.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "vin", "channel": "UCMMO5pgqu2vA7XRfZ4uCLDw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS4oz1EU2B9WSvOsN_W6spFAjusZrYgeHaowyzSyQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is kind of great for teachers to just put a massive load on your shoulders like that. But it has been really dissapointing to have basically a lot of people of my generation just not give a flying f*ck about climate change. I basically assumed it would be a large part of what my generation's work would involve. How f*cking wrong that turned out to be. Instead of going into engineering and trying to realise all the changes that would've been needed (and are now almost too late to deliver).

Yeah. I trust NASA and Climatempo's report for now, thank you very much.\n\nThe fires started in Bolivia and spread to Brasil? You clearly didn't look at the satellite images, and ignored the news about the Dia do Fogo.\n\nIts true that some people have been using photos unrelated to the current fires in social media. The fires are still confirmed from satellite images, and the photos are still a good representation of them, although I agree I'd prefer if people used photos and videos of the current fires exclusively.\n\nFinally, before posting my comment I checked with a bunch of people if they noticed the darkness as well, just to be sure. The question I asked was \"did you leave your house Monday afternoon?\". Everyone I talked to did and commented on the darkness. This was mostly people from S√£o Paulo city, but there were also people from the whole extent of the state.\n\nIt is true that S√£o Paulo can rarely get dark due to thunderstorm clouds. When this happens there's usually a thunderstorm that follows, and instead we got a light drizzle that lasted very little time. The color of the day darkens with a grey tinge in these cases, and people reported an eerie sepia tone this time instead. Some people also noted the water from the drizzle was black-ish and not clear as usual. This happened even in places far from S√£o Paulo city, close to the Mata Atl√¢ntica, where there's little pollution.\n\nI haven't searched for reports of the sky darkening in other states, but from the Climatempo report, the darkness was this bad due to the ashes serving as nucleation sites, bolstering cloud creation in the region of S√£o Paulo, that was going through weather instability already. So it happened due to both confounding factors. Frankly, this explanation is satisfying to me, as it takes into account all the evidence we have, and explains not only why there would be no reports from other states, as well as the different colors, unusual intensity, and lack of thunderstorm from this event.\n\nIn light of this you may want to nitpick and say that saying the darkness is due to the ashes is as misleading as saying it was caused due to normal weather instability for the region. You'd be wrong because the darkness wouldn't be so unnerving if it followed the same pattern as other times, and the difference this time was the ashes. Finally, normal weather instability is not alarming, but the current rate of deforesting and organized environmental crime happening right now is.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "brocoli", "channel": "UCTq9G9THxgH4gmwQRD6r9hw", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQdz3HJ0N9PGqnIdW39VXC8HmtTm5UghYU6MJbyow=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyUsZAdaQV0ovuuAJN4AaABAg", "text": "One comments:\n\nAs you cite: \n*indigenous sites are sacred because people believe \"There's a piece of me in that land, and a piece of that land in me. Maybe it's where my ancestors are buried or maybe it's where my tribe has gone for centuries, but the point is that the land and the people are like, /knots hands together/.\"*\n\nAnd you contrast that to Abrahamic religions, which according to your source, only care about sacred sites because of some historical thing that happened there.\n\nFrom a religious Jewish perspective, I have to disagree with your generalization. Knowing this is YouTube and leftist YouTube to boot, I'm aware that this could start a flamewar, but I think it's important to point out that the way you describe the indigenous relationship to the land ‚Äî a spiritual relationship, deeper than any historical connection ‚Äî is the same way Judaism treats the land of Israel. Just as natives who were forced out of their sacred land continued to hold it as a sacred part of their people, one connected at a deep level to its land, so too the Jewish people, forced out of its homeland by the Roman imperialists, continued to pray facing it, call upon the land of Zion and Jerusalem in litanies, and hope against hope that someday it would be returned to their hand. \nOne of the things about Christianity and Islam ‚Äî the two Abrahamic religions that your source seems to be mostly implying ‚Äî is that unlike indigenous beliefs, they are completely separate from ethnicity. This idea is important in two key ways: 1) anybody can be a Christian or a Muslim, and 2) someone born Christian or Muslim who is no longer a believer ceases to be one. Neither of those apply to indigenous beliefs, and neither of those apply to Judaism. The religious and spiritual connection between the Jewish people and the land of their origin is far more like the religious and spiritual connection between the Sioux and the Black Hills than it is the Muslim relationship to Mecca. Even when we were forced out, it was still our home. \n\nBy the way, and it upsets me that I even have to write this, but it's impossible to escape now especially in the politically leftist communities I love, this isn't meant to be an endorsement of the policies of the state of Israel. I personally think the settlements are stupid and the Netanyahu administration is doing whatever it can to lose any claims to the moral high ground. But I still feel closer to God when I'm in Jerusalem, even in East Jerusalem, than when I'm in America.\n\nOh, and \n1) saying \"I'm not anti-Semitic! I have Jewish friends who also oppose ZIonism!\" is like saying \"I'm not racist! I have black friends who oppose BLM!\"\n2) saying \"Jewish life was just fine in the Diaspora before they insisted on nationalism\" is like saying \"Black people were treated just fine on plantations before they got uppity\"\n3) one of the key features of identity politics is that every people should have the right to define their own oppression, and the Jewish people should not be an exception any more than indigenous peoples should be.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Isaac Mayer", "channel": "UCrj0jjp4fsBYod5PLI3YS9g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQqkNo4ONndCfF5I4xiWeEfWq02nmJIABHrZkXe=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyRHnTYH8X0WafXW6V4AaABAg", "text": "If we want to solve climate change, it is very important to understand the problem first. About a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions are from energy production, another quarter from agriculture and animal husbandry (around 6% directly come from cows). About a sixth from transport and the rest from construction, steel production and heating and air conditioning. We need technological and economical innovations in each of these sector along with carbon capture technologies to help us fight climate change. We need solutions that can provide clean reliable energy with the least impact to the ecosystem as a whole. Some of the solutions already exists like nuclear fission, we just need to do something about it. Just cutting on the amount of flights you really reduce your carbon footprint, using public transport is another. Having a decentralized and distributed consumption and generation of energy is the way forward. Being on the left side of the political and economical spectrum I am really happy to see people like Bill Gates doing things with Breakthrough Energy Ventures to solve the problem.

Being a communist in that equation, especially with the course focused firmly on climate change, has been an incredibly frustrating and alienating experience, because many people really do seem to believe that \"saving the planet\" lies in designers using different materials or in raising people's motivation or in making the personal choice not to travel by plane. There was no acknowledgement of the fundamental link to capitalism, hell, not even of the fact that so much change is held back by eg oil companies. And it can be a difficult thing to explain to people who don't already believe capitalism is something that needs to be done away with; a lot of people take it as a neglect of \"personal responsibility\" if you argue that consumer behavior is not how we counter-act climate change. I'm hardly a good debater in the first place, but it is an area of discussion I find uniquely frustrating, and I still don't know how to introduce the more useful ways of thinking about the issue in a way people take seriously. \nI really appreciate the idea of focusing on what parts of modern society we want to keep and which we don't, however.

The filters were meant to serve as a backup for the somewhat unreliable taps that normally supply these villages.\n\n\nI came up with a small, portable filter that was quite effective, but was somewhat expensive, and would require plastic bucket imports into the country, which would make it both more expensive, and less environmentally sustainable. My solution to this was not to change the design, but to change how it was deployed. Rather than relying on making some thousand of these little buckets, I suggested the idea to instead supply them at a communal level, kept inside communally-maintained storehouses across the village. In the event the water supplies broke, the smaller number of buckets would be distributed across the affected houses, used until the taps were fixed, and then returned to their storehouses for repair and refurbishment.\n\n\nThe lecturers promptly told me that the villagers would never accept such a thing, and that we should try and solve the environmental and cost problems in such a way that still produced a product that could be sold to every house in the village.

Water parks already existed, way before Homo sapiens stared making fire. We call them rivers and rapids and waterfalls. But sure if you want a big slide we can do that. Make it out of recycled plastic. Or plastic made from methane harvested from composting facilities, as there are already  tons and tons of methane that needs capturing at such facilities. Anyway, I could go on but I can‚Äôt deal with this phone interface anymore rn.

I want there to be games and all sorts of other entertainment experiences in the world, after all, and some would argue that these are not part of what will survive. Personally, however, I think the world will always need artists and designers and storytellers because those are things we as humans crave.\nAnd honestly, in regards to design as a discipline over all, I do think it's a useful way to learn to think, especially when considering how we might do things differently in a future society!

I can't speak for islam but the way jewish liturgy talks about the land of israel (the historical jewish concept that i somehow can't talk about without people claiming im trying to make some totally different point) reads way differently than your talking about it. Its millenia old tradition sculpted around the land, around the plants, the harvests, the deep spiritual connection to a place that is so tied to identity that being forced from it shatters the soul.\n\nIt's not just because some historical stuff happened there. I know this makes things that are already complicated more complicated, but in a video about how different cultures might teach us things bc of their different connection to the land I thought it important. Whatever else 'the land of israel' might mean in really complicated and fcked up situations, it is also a thousands of years old basis for a world religion that also has things to say about respecting the planet and nature, and lumping it in and simplifying it to abrahamic religions eclipses some insights on a topic were we really can't afford to do that this. Especially, as you say in this video, just because it complicates other problems.\n\nOtherwise, I loved the video, and you raised important points as always.

It could not be construed as self-defense in any respect, nor a defense of human life in general, or life on Earth as a whole. Most importantly, of course, should these people continue to succeed in blocking significant climate policy (the kind sufficient to prevent the death and suffering that is surely to come, rather than just serve as a symbol to appease voters), effectively robbing people looking to survive, and ensure the survival of future generations, of all other options, there remain so many other options!\n\nTo put down the jokes for a moment, just between you and me, I don't like the idea of hurting anybody, or anybody being hurt. But I stress that people are already being hurt and it is our shared moral imperative to protect their lives, our lives, and the lives of our children. Luckily for my conscience, hurting individual people is not terribly useful. In the immediate term, the most effective course of action is to back the most dramatic climate policy possible, and to back it up with direct action of the sort done at Standing Rock. To blockade, disable, or damage hydrocarbon-transporting infrastructure, such that prices are raised and shortages created, and to do so broadly and consistently.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "What a Buffoon", "channel": "UCbVyDCMIeuUjD6fukARdXhw", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTAJm6qhOkKb4BtZr4rduyDq0DObwPjGvuMV3gU=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Earth is exactly within the habitable zone from the sun, and nothing else is except the moon. Earth also has an atmosphere that contains enough oxygen, carbon dioxide and ozone to allow an ecosystem of recycled respiration between flora and fauna as well as maintain a protective shell that works in tandem with the planet's natural electromagnetic barrier, the \"magnetosphere\" (which tidally-locked bodies only produce very rarely, due to a lack of spin).\n\nAll this put together creates a planet that can harbor carbon-based life such as ours, given a couple billion years to work itself out.\n\nThe point being that we're pretty damn rare, considering how much nothing the known universe is, and despite how much random shit is in it.\n\nSo we might mess it up pretty bad, but unless we completely lose our atmosphere or stop our core from spinning, she's free to try again til the sun explodes, and literally nothing will be left of us, save maybe some fossils and a bit of an oil layer... and that will be incinerated well before the heat-death of the universe. üòï", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Virjunior", "channel": "UCaUUybNwIz3nQPWV8_BFHQg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSGG7x2TNExi3FOO8vZ-MZdy39Vbxbe9UF_BpIKjw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugynt72M6s7mrlMDCO14AaABAg", "text": "Small issue, it is unclear if I (the viewer) am grieving the death of the planet or the death of myself. \n\nUsing the Kubler-Ross theory of grief, that framework of grief is supposed to extend to label what an individual is going through while processing their own upcoming death. This framework has been applied to grieves processing the grief of the loved one who died. I believe that is framework gained a crazy amount of attention because of how simplistically it is applied to practically anything. I have issue with it because the last stage is \"acceptance\" (which one can bounce in and out of) but it implies a conclusion to a process in which the bereaved person carries with them the rest of their lives; even aspects of that grief picked up by others to be carried through their lives. There is no conclusion but because of the society we live in, there needs to be hope of a conclusion so we can move on to the next thing.\n\nI propose a framework shift from Kubler-Ross to Worden‚Äôs 4 tasks of grief. This framework is meant for the bereaved to be more active in their grief offering solutions, much like the video is doing, and acknowledging that it does suck but that loss has no conclusion or finality. It encourages the bereaved to keep going. While this frame work of the 4 tasks is almost 30 years old, it doesn‚Äôt compete because of the high amount of attention currency that Kubler-Ross‚Äôs framework has received. \n\nI bring this up, not to shit post or belittle the points made but that I think the framework of Worden‚Äôs four tasks fits more inline with the continent and purpose of the video. I don‚Äôt expect Ollie to have known about the literature on the grieving process (again, even people in the grief/mental business don‚Äôt know about this framework because so much has been invested in Kubler-Ross) so I wanted to share to help strengthen his message. I greatly look forward into diving into his recommend indigenous literature because I am very interested to hear from this perspective.\n\nThanks for the video!", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "C Kat", "channel": "UClfullV66yNdhKQrHlWBq3g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR7Fs5EmOp9ujZJSXaosEyMAWfGbB5MW3laXOY3gA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzvQvYFj2knYlTzGR54AaABAg", "text": "Three books that have really helped me to deal with Climate Grief:\n\n1. Hot Earth Dreams by Frank Landis. This book is excellent because it takes an educated and extremely long-term view of the probable effects of climate change in a worst-case scenario where humans are still likely to survive. It‚Äôs really good to have a realistic idea of what we and our descendants are going to be facing up against after we stop pretending.\n\n2. After the Ice by Stephen Mithen. This is a history of Paleolithic humans, with special attention paid to how our ancestors reacted to climactic changes in their own time. For me it really shone a light on how our ways of life can change radically as conditions change. If there are humans or creatures like humans who will be alive into the deep future they‚Äôll face challenges that are the result of our actions today. But these people won‚Äôt just live in our shadow eternally. Their ways of life will the the only ones they know, and they‚Äôll find many things to love about them. In the same way, Paleolothic people who were forced from sedentary lives into nomadic ones by climate change would have found things to love about their new lifestyle, it being the only one they know. \n\n3. Always Coming Home, by Ursula le Guin. This is a story, sort of a fictional ethnography, about an extremely far distant future where the apocalyptic events that happened to our civilization (climate change, war, pollution) isn‚Äôt even remembered. The people the book focuses on combine aspects of hunter-gathered, agricultural, and industrial lifestyles (for example, they have access to things like trains and electricity, but totally eschew mass production). Societies that attempt to build up an industrial state like today‚Äôs generally fail, because with one thing and another the planet is too weak to support that kind of lifestyle. \n\nFor me these books have worked as a sort of 1-2-3 punch. They haven‚Äôt anaesthetized me, I‚Äôm still politically active and I still want to change my lifestyle as much as I can to live in a better way. But they‚Äôve helped to show me a sort of  hope on the far side of despair.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Ecta", "channel": "UCDRIf922eeh5QR0wch7hwbA", "votes": "88", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRN1izNdHvLhMDy6NXYSFBPB_7Q_Glq8ipqp3Q_=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I feel like the Attenborough bits kind of undermined work as a whole, a bit. Partly because the absurdity didn't mesh with the (gorgeous) funeral aesthetic and partly because a lot of nature documentaries separate us from the world (reinforcing the empty 'Nature' category). I adore Attenborough, but much of his line of work and his hushed tones in particular lend a mysticism to environments and species that is distancing, in a way; its like being inside of a holy construct rather than simply being*. They let us know that these things are 'Special and Important', rather than 'right there, part of us'. Which sort of detracts from part of your point, I think? Anyway, loved the central video as a whole, fab work <3 looking forward to the post mortem, where I learn that I'm way off, haha!\n\n\n*Compare and contrast someone like Steve Irwin's style/manner; animals are awesome and scary and my good mates and they're right there - touch 'em! Maybe this is a critique of style; the connection is lost when its 'just' gorgeous imagery and a disembodied voice. Attenborough's most touching work has most often been when he is right there, interacting, as well.

Secondly, the 'hushed tones' comment has nothing to do with noises in nature and everything to do with how we relate to it - blanket reverance keeps it separate from us rather than making it a part of who we are; this makes it harder to relate to, connect to, save. As referenced in the video the fact that (to your mind) we 'aren't' there to touch it; the separatation of man from nature as if we are not still animals, the constructed clarity of the alleged boundaries of 'city' and the 'wilds'*; these are all problems, in  a sense. We need to try deconstruct that and try repositon ourselves back within nature, otherwise the planet is an abstract that it doesnt really matter if we save, because are defining ourselves out of it.\n\nThirdly, I didn't say I wasn't immersed in nature docs - fairly sure I made my love of them and Attenborough fairly clear. Finally, somewhat ironically, I studied Milton at school (because I took Marlowe's Faustus and followed the devils) and then again at uni, where PL and Areopagitica were two of my favourite texts (albeit for verrrry different reasons). So, thats an accidentally way-off analogy. Enjoyed the irony though XD\n\n*this is also hella false, by the way. There is a hell of a lot of nature in cities, and a lot of it is noisy af. I live between two scrappy little patches of woodland in a fairly big city ; we have a whole host of songbirds, corvids, foxes, badgers, frogs, newts, a million squirrels, sparrowhawks - there are peregrines nesting on a nearby tower block and more in the cathedral in the city centre. We have some amazing crows I adore spending time with. Nature is touchable and I am in a city.\n\nLots of animals thrive in cities, just as many animals will appropriate old bird nests and squirrel dreys, because we are a part of the natural world. Cities in the UK have a bevy of birds, bugs and beasties - there are wild deer not far out of Central London. There are leopards in Mumbai! Pretending our cities aren't wild habitats is why those animals that do struggle (pollinators like bees, animals like hedgehogs) are struggling (in part). This sort of thing is a barrier to potential new ways of thinking.
