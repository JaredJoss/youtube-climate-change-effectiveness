Then they move someplace else. Leaving behind dead and barren land. With nothing to stop the sand. In a year the sand piles up. In 2 years after the camels are all the plants. All evidence of plant life is gone. \nThis is called over grazing. This was a major problem in the USA. Then the government came in with realistic laws and everything changed. \nThe solution is to limit the number of animals to how many animals the land can support. \nLimit grazing in one area. Allow the camels to only eat 1/3 of the plants in one area. Then move to another area. Next year the plants would have recovered. They can graze that area every year as long as they limit the grazing to 1/3 of the plants. \nIt is so easy to say ‚Äúclimate change ‚Äú then say nothing can be done. Instead of having crop land sized to how much water the well can safely provide. They plant 10 times as much land. Dig the well deeper. Pump out more water than the ground can replenish. Then you get him high levels of salt. Soon the land becomes barren. \nIn the USA Midwest. Some areas can only sustain 1 cow and a calf per acre. The ranchers follow the law. The land is able to be grazed at a sustainable level forever. \nSo don‚Äôt blame climate change for your bad farming decisions. \nTake responsibility for your bad decisions.

Even though you might have a point by saying that bad farming decisions can be disastrous for the region, one can hardly blame longer periods of drought and less rainfall on the fact that there's an (unproven) overpopulation of camels in the desert. Also, you draw your conclusion from one frame out of a documentary that shows a herd of camels. How about actually looking up whether Morocco has a problem with an overpopulation of camels? According to a quick Google search, there are about 60.000 camels in all of Morocco, and this numer is declining. I do believe one can hardly blame large camel herds for the problems that are shown in the video. At most, large camel herds are just a tiny part of the problem. And even this, remains unproven. Climate change, on the other hand, has been a proven fact for decades now. What we see in Morocco, is what we see in almost all parts of the world happening right now: less rainfall, more droughts, deforestation, desertification, more catastrophes and storms, etc. It is our combined global lifestyle, with the USA and China being the lead culprits in this mess, that is making this happen. It's the fact that our entire global economy is based on unsustainable corporate greed, empowered by an ignorant populace that goes along with this, that we are in this situation. And this will only get worse. So don't be saying thins like \"Do this and the land will turn green again\", for it is simply untrue. As long as the problem of global warming does not get tackled, these places will never turn green again.

This is causing rapid desertification and lack of water for anything but agriculture in most hotter regions. What we need is global standards for sustainable and renewable processes in every level of industry. And those must be enforced everywhere.\nEcosystems are like machines that produce certain amount of resources. You can take the excess from the top, but at some point you will start using resources this machine needs to operate if you take too much. Thus lowering the output and damaging the machine. Recovering this ecosystem is pretty easy when it's only slightly damaged, but it becomes exponentially harder. Then there's all the unmanaged waste we are spilling out which is also just accelerating this process.\nThere's constant fight over resources now, all the while ensuring future generations will be left with less of everything. Worst part is that it's not even that hard of a problem to solve we use methods we have today. I mean it's kind of ridiculous we fight for oil for example, when we could quite easily replace most oil use. \n\nStuff is cheap today because we are taking on credit from the earth that we are not paying back.

I think the cause of their struggles is not just Global Warming. Global warming is just part of the problem, just partly responsible for this. There more issues responsible for this.\n...\nBig parts of Atlas mountains have almost no vegetation cover and experience severe soil erosion during winter, because bare rock isn't able to hold big seasonal rains that usually occur in winter.\n(And water takes soil with it...)\n(Of course rain shadow effect plays its part in some areas getting much less rain, but that doesn't mean on less rainy side it never rains.)\nFrom Atlas Mountains and other mountains surounding it in Morroco, water is flowing as rivers into more desert areas, sand able to store water even when riverbeds went seemingly dry and turned to wadis.\nWithout vegetation cover, it all goes away in floods and barely has time to seep into ground, into groundwater levels.\n...\nWhat Morroco should invest in is teaching people more about water managment and importance of vegetation cover. If done in mountain areas, it would then help in areas bellow mountains too.\nStopping or at least lowering severity of floods, helping to store water through dry seasons, bringing abundance and life back to landscape.\nHence helping to cope with effects global warming too.\n...\nThough teaching people living in oasis around desert is of course helpful too. \nFriend of my mum used unglazed pots irrigation to water her gardens(she lives in very hot place), and around the pots her vegetables are twice the size than where there are none.\nMorocco is known for its pottery. They one possible, rather cheap method of irigation, right there!\n...\nOf course there is more to restoring the landscape than just irigation.

{"cid": "UgwRc3VnZvo-sfj71jx4AaABAg.9AYElSZAH9T9BSyu8fb5Pr", "text": "I only partly agree with you. Because clearly, even native plants such as dates palm are dying due to lack of water, meaning there is absolutely no way that area would be able to grow large amounts of water intensive crops. Even if they wanted to.\nUsing too much artificial fertilizer is of course bad anywhere, because you can polute your water supply and soil even for years to come.\n..\nHowever, spending water is just part of problem, but in my opinion not the largest part of it.\nAnywhere  in the world there are water shortages, usually there are done little or no effort to better keep water in landscape. And with growing population it quickly becomes major problem.\nMorocco is not so bad when it comes to annual rainfall as some other places. \nBut annual winter rainfall increasingly more often gets flashed away in floods, because landscape is unable to hold most of it. \nIf landscape was able to hold most of the winter rains, then it would be no problem to grow both native very dry resistant plants and those more demanding, and satisfy water demands of animals, trees and people.\n\n...\nI agree that people had ruined the land more than climate change, because they destroyed vegetation cover of Atlas Mountains and around that(possibly the big damage was done already several hundred years ago on South and South-East side of Atlas Mountains, maybe even prior-Romans hunted some species in area to extinction etc.), which in turn resulted to rivers such as Draa not having enough water to flow all year around, and they turned from river to wadis. \nSo the main problem is not high water demanding crops, but the water retention ability of landscape(how much water landscape can hold).\nIn past and even nowadays, many people don't at all realise that their actions only contribute to erosion and their enviroment getting worse.\nI also agree that if we grow plants that are benefitial to the landcape, we will help.\nOf course! Good plants, shrubs and trees, that help improve soil, that create their own soil(in some places there is just bare rock), that create vegetation cover and help keep water in landscape. Problem is how to irigate them when you already have water shortage.\nYou could of course use unglazed teracota pots buried into ground, which helps iritate with much lower water spent, and given Morocco's pottery, it could be very cheap and simple method, that one could show people who are already struggling. \n..\nHowever if you did just that, you'd maybe not fail, but it would really take long time to achieve what you want-restoration of landscape and keeping water in landscape(and seeping into undeground).\nOne needs to actually be able to read the landscape and create earthworks to achieve big change, working with contours-swells, stone lines, terraces, check dams(boulder dams, or gabions principe is basically same), sand dams...and more!\nThere is many possibilities and I can just google for few minutes and will be able to find them.\nBut do those people in poor areas even have access to internet? And even if they had, do they know where to look? \n...\nBut to person who just sees pictures, Europe can seem as paradise, green etc.\n(They don't see how many mistakes with water retention we make, and it will become problem in future)\nWhat they should look at however, are places and people who have hot dry climate and thrive nevertheless or at least manage to improve despite that. Who are able to achieve big results even at desert with terrible soil quality or just bare rock.\n...\nIf you're interested John D Liu's Green Gold on youtube, he covered Loess Plateau-massive chinese restoration project, Ethiopean project, and I believe Geoff Lawton's project in Jordan desert.\nGeoff Lawton has channel on youtube where he explains in details how they manage to grow trees in very harsh climates and what are basic mistakes which people make when they try to plant vegetation cover in hot dry areas.

By 'big countries' they meant the pan european/US empire, which are capitalist countries who are in fact responsible for the climate catastrophe we are now in; How? Extractionalism. I will provide a very bare bones explaination of it so i urge you to look into everything and realize that borders do not exist, they're a colonial made up construct, and these corporations murdering the amazon and displacing thousands of indigenous communities isnt an isolated incident, its happening all around the world. When permafrost melts and ecosystems burn it will affect other parts of the world. mining companies roam the world in order to extract resources and get rich off of that colonial exploitation. Examples of environmental havoc caused by colonizing \"big countries\" happening TODAY include Embridge (canadian oil company illegally exploiting indigenous lands) line 3, the wetsuweten fight against pipelines on their land, standing rock (the list goes on and on) Just off the top of my head, a british oil company called amerisur polluted the Siona peoples water by dumping oil in the amazon rivers, Boxite companies in jamaica exploiting and displacing (vice made a doc about it), Maxima Acunas fight against a mining company that literally colonized her land (google her, shes a hero) the ecuador oil spill catastrophe, nigerias oil spill catastrophy, the lenca peoples fight against a corporations dam, the list goes on and on.  Indigenous people all around the world are fighting capitalist imperialist companies and the governments that support capitalistic death extractionalism, This is the interconnected cause and why its the responsibility of 'big country' governments AKA capitalism, racism and its extractionalism are the cause.
