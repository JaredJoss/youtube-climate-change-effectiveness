In between fishing sessions, they haul themselves out onto the sea ice to rest. But those resting places have now melted away. Instead they have to swim to the beaches on distant coasts. There are only a few suitable places. So two-thirds of the population of Pacific walrus, tens of thousands of them, now assemble on one single beach. Crushingly overcrowded, some clamber up slopes and find themselves at the tops of cliffs.

Obviously this is a natural occurrence, but the fact that it has been happening much more than it should be is what is alarming. This is some evidence, but not great evidence of what we are doing to the world. What we really need to focus on is not whether their claims are true or not, rather the pollution that humans create. People live everyday completely ignorant of what they are actually doing to the environment around them. And this is because the people that control everything hide it from them. They dont want people to come together and realize what's really happening. They are truly scared of what the human race is capable of, so they do their best to keep us quiet and separated. They dont give an actual shit about the environment, or what happens to those under them. They dump billions of tons of garbage into the ocean, and emit staggering amounts of CO2 waste into the air from their factories. Plastic of which they make and distribute goes out into the ocean, and kills the marine life. Of course the rising water levels and the warming of the ocean is debatable about whether we are the direct influence of it. And walruses falling off of cliffs is just a small piece of evidence, of which is hard to prove a result of melting ice. Forest fires in Australia may not be global warming, instead being a result of too much underbrush. But regardless, the corporations are causing the death and extinction of millions of species world wide. Not just in this country, but India and China also being huge influences. However if we all come together in the realization of what the top 1% does to us and our surroundings, and we revolt against it. We could easily topple them and break free of the control, and miseducation that they are feeding us. It is not the people who are the problem, it's the top 1% that is the problem.

Millions of square miles of ice melts every single year in the Arctic, and it grows back by winter. Its true that there does seem to be slightly less ice overall every year, but our data on that only goes back to the 1970s and for all we know, that could be just a completely natural trend. My point is that both walruses and polar bears are well accustomed to the ebb and flow of ice. These walruses aren't dying because of climate change, they're dying because sometimes animals just die. The overcrowding isn't a result of less land, its actually because they have been too successful in their breeding and now their population outstrips their territory.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Signum Magnum", "channel": "UCVbCnY0aAZ_wlrRGBGoxsLg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRVYlTNj9fJ3KjFY3kQXxVPybuBvQNeR9AcqYYu6Q=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgywrWqeokf2EGDYvLV4AaABAg", "text": "There's evidence that this was actually very misleading on the part of the film makers.  Walruses get spooked by polar bears and often fall off a cliff as they try to escape.  The filmmakers, probably alerted by resident WWF employees in the region, moved in after polar bears caused hundreds of walrus to fall to their deaths. The crew then captured on film the last few falls over the cliff as the walrus herd moved away from the haulout.  Furthermore, there's evidence that this happens in regions that aren't short on space as well.  Lastly, walruses fall off of cliffs because of planes, other animals, or anything that might spook them.  The fact that the film makers can attribute this to climate change is completely unfounded and at best a leap of faith.  The best part is that if you look at all the major media outlets, not one considers the possibility that something else is happening here.  Bottom line, the film makers weren't honest and there's likely more to the story than climate change.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "kshuf", "channel": "UCXELjiPhvTxVkp86-hoBwYg", "votes": "12", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSSUGsEdnGLOtq3_2ylNazYAicU5uwdIr420g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugz2ueyNRPz0r8arqxp4AaABAg.8ynx3lnWZ_t9FotbxROeBJ", "text": "¬†@M F¬† From Livescience: \"This incident isn't the first time people have documented the mass-falling deaths of walruses. Back in 1996, Alaskan wildlife officials reported a then-nearly unprecedented incident in which nearly 60 male walruses fell to their deaths off a 200-foot (60 meters) cliff side in the state. At the time, when sea ice was still more extensive and climate impacts less well-understood, researchers didn't blame the deaths on climate change. Rather, they were perplexed, without an answer to explain the behavior, The New York Times reported at the time. The years since have seen further reports of these sorts of walrus events.\r\n\nBut more-recent research has indicated that climate change could be driving deadly \"disturbances\" at walrus \"haul-outs\" in exactly the way the documentary indicates. Walruses typically spend most of their time on sea ice, with some intermittent time spent on land in large groups called haul-outs.\r\n\nA May 2017 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) found that the retreat of sea ice from the Arctic does indeed lead walruses to engage in mass haul-outs onto crowded beaches more often. And at those crowded haul-outs, the walruses are indeed easily spooked, with an increase in deadly \"disturbance\" events ‚Äî though tramplings, especially of young calves, are much more common than cliff falls, according to that report.\r\n\nSubject matter experts suggested to Live Science that falling events typically don't involve the walruses scaling cliffs as the documentary indicated. Rather, the events happen as walruses go up shallow slopes on the cliffs' far sides. Once up top, the creatures can sometimes stampede off these cliff sides if a passing plane, polar bear, boat or other unfamiliar freaky thing scares them.\r\n\r\nClimate change does seem to have made these sorts of events more common. However, in Alaska these mass fallings appear to local observers to have declined in recent years thanks to human efforts to manage the environments of the haul-outs. Reductions in overhead planes and other human disturbances appear to have prevented at least some of the deaths. Coastal management efforts, led by local native groups, have also been effective to some degree.\"", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Math Cosmos", "channel": "UCzfo5P9LvicVb2NyjqC28SQ", "votes": "15", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkazwhiU3EcpLAgnZSLszGtDHQPJxJrikh0T4Jtw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There is exactly the same amount of water raining down and going back into the sky every day.  Haven't you ever thought thru this? They want your money by telling you to conserve they charge you more for each gallon of water. The people telling you to conserve are greedy liars!

Ice has a specific melting point, if the base/ average temperature raises above that then more ice will melt than can re-freeze during the cold seasons. This leads to a slow decline in artic ice but more importantly to a steep increase in ocean water, specifically fresh water. This in turn messes up the oceans currents due to the ratio of salt changing and the water retaining heat differently because of that.

The ice is mostly receding due to LIA recovery, and not because of climate change. NASA's been studying this through satellite imagery since the 70s, predicting to a T exactly how the levels would recede due to LIA recovery. Couple that with that fact that in the time we've been studying walruses at great lengths (mere decades) that they've been falling off of cliffs to their deaths, yes even including cliffs covered in ice, and what we've got here is literal fear mongering.

Because ultimately they are the least affected, in fact many stand to gain from it if they play their cards right.\nClimate change isn't just an accident anymore, it's being deliberately perpetuated by the people with the real power to change society.\n\nThe solution is not to just individually be good consumers, but to make structural changes to our entire industrial society to avert the worst of this climate genocide.\nThe way to do this is by acting collectively to take power away from those steering us into oblivion, not by individually shouldering their guilt.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "TheAmazingchickens", "channel": "UCM7iB9io6pXkLMIocQXaFZw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSykCc0JhnS2aaxRGOu0fZXVLwiXe-BqGe_AA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Problem number one   The kind of people that push climate change really hard are  fanatical   They all believe the same thing and they would never give any other viewpoint or even Acknowledge  another viewpoint That was against theirs . They want you to believe what they‚Äôre saying no matter what they will twist the truth. they‚Äôll do whatever it takes to get you to believe in Climate change  my problem is they‚Äôre too narrow minded and to untrustworthy if that makes sense I might could‚Äôve explained that better. problem number two  why would the Arctic be showing such drastic signs.  And not other places. If the ice in one of  the coldest places in the world is  melting why haven‚Äôt desert Become uninhabitable many desert are habitable. Not so long ago I went to the Grand Canyon why was their hundreds and hundreds of people there. Why weren‚Äôt  we all dying of heat stroke  why would the Arctic‚Äòs heat up and show drastic signs and not the rest of the world if the whole planet was heating up, the Arctic would be the last place we noticed that to happen the jungles would dry out the swamps would dry up the oceans would start rising . The arctic is still cold why would it be the first thing to show signs it‚Äôs gonna take longer for it to heat up.  Let me explain that a little better of course we would notice major differences in the Arctic‚Äôs there would be visible signs.  But I can‚Äôt but help think of the other environments that arent changing  so why would the Arctic be.  storms and  weather would be crazy and  Catastrophic maybe I could explain this better to but you get what I‚Äôm saying. Why aren‚Äôt  jungles and forests ,swaps, And desert not heating up like the  Arctic  as well .  Plus NASA has proven that Antarctica is getting more ice . And also for there to even be icebergs and large amounts of ice  like that we would have to be in an ice age  Which we are  that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs icebergs  in the First place. problem number three if global warming is real why would people be freaking out as bad as they are. Before humans came around the planet was way hotter  then it is now.  Think of all the animals that have gone extinct because of humans now. Now think of this Before humans got here  millions and millions of species of animals went extinct    Through  various different Means rather it be volcanoes, the Ice Age,  A meteor  hitting the  planet    So many extinction events we couldn‚Äôt stop.  Extinction events happen without humans to.  Problem number four they were saying 100 years ago there would be no icebergs today well  surprise they‚Äôre still here. don‚Äôt get me wrong  it‚Äôs sad and horrible when animals go extinct it‚Äôs terrible I love  animals they‚Äôre awesome  I don‚Äôt want to see animals die for any reason.

Yes everything here is a little over exaggerated, including the video. But I know that we are polluting the environment beyond its end, and this is causing millions of animal habitats to be in jeopardy. It's also been causing the glaciers of the poles to melt at a exponentially increased rate for over 25 years. Especially since I have first hand experience being in Antarctica and seeing the ice melt at increasing rates over time. Scientists have studied the ice melting, and found that ice is melting way faster then it did at any other time in recorded history. So they conclude that it's being caused by pollution from humans, since carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are have also exponentially grown since the industrial revolution. And actually, the only reason why we are still here today is because of the trees of which we are destroying. They have taken in most of the carbon that we dump into the atmosphere, so maybe the trees know more than we do. And the reason why I'm so concerned about the glaciers is because the faster they melt the more water gets dumped into the ocean and the sea levels rise. Then causing our land to recede, which condenses the human population. And what happens then? Do we go underground? Do we go into the sky? The water? I doubt it because of our extremely dysfunctional government, that dont have the brains to think of these things and make an effort to prepare. So we are basically gonna be faced with possible extinction if nothing is done.

Their home is gone, and they need to be close enough to their food source to survive, so they are forced to live on land.  These animals are packed together on a small area of land stumbling on top of eachother, just so they can rest. Many walruses die by stampedes, of other walruses trying to find rest. To aviod being crushed to death, many walruses (if you are unaware, they have poor eyesight outside of water), climb up these high cliffs to find a relatively clear place to rest. When they are hungry, they have no choice but to fall off the cliff, leading to many deaths. This would not have happened if it wasn't for climate change. Their homes have melted, and now they are forced to places they shouldn't even be in the first place. So all of those who don't take this matter seriously, I would advise you to please take some time out of your day and watch the Netflix series. You will not regret it, and it will change your perspective entirely. \r\nThank You.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "IPod MP3", "channel": "UCqjuKbUrq5yTFLDmxS5KEgg", "votes": "50", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS6a6Z5lktcJmBq40Ac3ZxKPU77gR_pM5gIZA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Zoologist Susan Crockford has claimed walruses dying is Due to polar bears and its most the likely caused, the over crowing on the beach drive the walruses up the cliff to the flat top, The bear,s find it easier to hunt, and are not disturbed when feeding. the first reports of this come back in 90s in the Bering Strait  and there's incident in Russia in 2017.  think about!   If that rock was covered with ice, what difference would it make.  These are large animal, Huge. A lot of the dead on the beach were crushed by eachother think of the weight, the one's that fell to there death, were right by the cliff, and yet there bodies are right across the beach and in the sea. If Global warming was to blamed. it would be because of space forcing these amazing animal on to one small Island probably because of bad weather, It high likely there stormie sea are due to weather change, Global warming has a lot to do with this, forcing these animal together because they would of been more spread out if there were more sea ice. But the same goes for the bears. there real problem is human prospextive, we all know religion is not as popular, and that mankind has finally waken up, BUT where still prepared to waste 400 billion building a cathedral, sad thou it was. but could you imagine out much it would go to to clean the sea, built ships to filter the plastic put back habitat in reaf's so on, At one point in science magazine they were thinking of put reflective sail in near orbital space platform. to lighten the winter sky. SO! why used the same tech to Darken the pole,s and stopping the light absorption on the albido, force the poles to freeze.  But in there end do we really deserve what we got, if were only going to destroy it anyway.

Their home is gone, and they need to be close enough to their food source to survive, so they are forced to live on land.  These animals are packed together on a small area of land stumbling on top of eachother, just so they can rest. Many walruses die by stampedes, of other walruses trying to find rest. To aviod being crushed to death, many walruses (if you are unaware, they have poor eyesight outside of water), climb up these high cliffs to find a relatively clear place to rest. When they are hungry, they have no choice but to fall off the cliff, leading to many deaths. This would not have happened if it wasn't for climate change. Their homes have melted, and now they are forced to places they shouldn't even be in the first place. So all of those who don't take this matter seriously, I would advise you to please take some time out of your day and watch the Netflix series.

These animals are packed together on a small area of land stumbling on top of eachother, just so they can rest. Many walruses die by stampedes, of other walruses trying to find rest. To aviod being crushed to death, many walruses (if you are unaware, they have poor eyesight outside of water), climb up these high cliffs to find a relatively clear place to rest. When they are hungry, they have no choice but to fall off the cliff, leading to many deaths. This would not have happened if it wasn't for climate change. Their homes have melted, and now they are forced to places they shouldn't even be in the first place.

Let me explain to you the real issue...\r\nThese walruses live on ice. Ice that is melting because of us, humans. Their home is gone, and they need to be close enough to their food source to survive, so they are forced to live on land.  These animals are packed together on a small area of land stumbling on top of eachother, just so they can rest. Many walruses die by stampedes, of other walruses trying to find rest. To aviod being crushed to death, many walruses (if you are unaware, they have poor eyesight outside of water), climb up these high cliffs to find a relatively clear place to rest. When they are hungry, they have no choice but to fall off the cliff, leading to many deaths. This would not have happened if it wasn't for climate change. Their homes have melted, and now they are forced to places they shouldn't even be in the first place. So all of those who don't take this matter seriously, I would advise you to please take some time out of your day and watch the Netflix series. You will not regret it, and it will change your perspective entirely. \r\nThank You.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "IPod MP3", "channel": "UCqjuKbUrq5yTFLDmxS5KEgg", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS6a6Z5lktcJmBq40Ac3ZxKPU77gR_pM5gIZA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Their home is gone, and they need to be close enough to their food source to survive, so they are forced to live on land.  These animals are packed together on a small area of land stumbling on top of eachother, just so they can rest. Many walruses die by stampedes, of other walruses trying to find rest. To aviod being crushed to death, many walruses (if you are unaware, they have poor eyesight outside of water), climb up these high cliffs to find a relatively clear place to rest. When they are hungry, they have no choice but to fall off the cliff, leading to many deaths. This would not have happened if it wasn't for climate change. Their homes have melted, and now they are forced to places they shouldn't even be in the first place. So all of those who don't take this matter seriously, I would advise you to please take some time out of your day and watch the Netflix series.

Then there is also a big group that has critique towards climate change. They're not doubting climate change, but critical to what is causing climate change. Is this the cause of the earth changing, remember that the earth is still active and goes through different phases. Or perhaps is this caused by the high level of CO2 emissions caused by humans? Maybe this effect is combined, however how much is what?\n\nI'm just throwing out a number as we haven't gotten the data to prove otherwise, but assume CO2 emissions are only 15% of the effect for climate change, and the remainder are other factors including the earth changing. Would it still be effective to aim towards lower CO2 emissions? How much of an impact would this in return have? Again, there's little actual data on the earths temperature past 100-150 years, especially in the high quality of recording detail as we have today. And even if we had data for up to 500 years, would that be sufficient given how old earth is? \n\n\nAgain, as you hopefully can see and understand, it's not about saying that climate change is false, as it takes no intellectual to conclude that the earth is living and breathing, thus the climate is in change. And it does nothing to shout, preach and complain that climate change is real. What exactly is causing climate change in more detail, is the nr.1 goal. When that has been established, then one can work towards reducing that.\n\nHowever, remember that there are always two sides. Perhaps the walruses are dying, but the starving/undermalnourished polar bears are thriving in numbers as an effect of this change in the world. If it wasn't the walruses, it would have been the polar bears.

Looking at the records we are historically the coolest the earth as been if you look at this millennium. The way the climate has been going is a raise in temp then a ice age happens then the temp raises again but it doesn't reach the previous high. The earth is over all losing heat in the long term.\nThis is also attached to the sun cycles where the sun will have a cycle of higher output every couple of decades and a big spike every couple of century's.\n\nThe climate was much hotter in the past and we just came out of a couple of small iceages and about to head into the next iceage if you look at the historical trend. The temp will go up and down never reaching the previous high temperatures the earth used to have in the past. This is nature.\n\nNo one cares about the dinosaurs that would not be able to survive in what they would consider a cold climate.\nHumans have very little impact on the current temp probably only adjusting it by a marginal percentage. The real issue is pollution not global warming as countries like China and India dump humongous amounts of chemicals every where destroying the environment.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "TZoningHard", "channel": "UCQYsSmkkDgrPlCBq7jtNsGw", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTUMx8c2vd5rJIlazs7di_uCq8nmFBAIaaa0Y4Krw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also the rising co2 levels would at some point start to suffocate every breathing organism on this planet, starting from the sea life where oxygen concentration is already very low. That would also mean that most humans would die, which is already happening around the world due to overpopulation which goes hand in hand with the global warming. Usually first dies the animals on the bottom of the food chain and when the food sources die out, so does the predators. Also imagine having to take care of planting every plant in the world due to all the pollinators dying out. Those who would survive would most likely have to struggle from day to day just to get by. Those who either deny global warming or say it's natural are on the same intellectual level as flat earthers, anti vaxers and all other crazy people. Also as a fun experiment for you who do not believe in global warming and the harm of way too high co2 content in the air: Connect a long tube to your rear pipe in your car and pull it through a window inside your car, then turn the engine on, close all other windows, close air the ac and chill for about 30 to 60min.

{"cid": "Ugwe1UE1ebTLrDJdn3R4AaABAg", "text": "And  . . . BS.  This was funded by WWF and is propaganda, pure and simple.  \nThe walruses leaping to their death was due to the fact that they were being hunted by polar bears according to Susan Crockford, a zoologist and adjunct professor at the University of Victoria.  According to her, the marked death in walruses via fall from a cliffside coincided with a report by The Siberian Times, which noted itself that the falling walruses were a result of polar bears spooking the creatures.  She stated:\n\n\"Despite many statements to the press, the film crew have steadfastly refused to reveal precisely where and when they filmed the walrus deaths shown in this film in relation to the walrus deaths initiated by polar bears reported by The Siberian Times in the fall of 2017.\n\n    I can only conclude, therefore, that the two incidents are indeed essentially one and the same: that the filmmakers, probably alerted by resident WWF employees at Ryrkaipiy, moved in after polar bears caused hundreds of walrus to fall to their deaths. The crew then captured on film the last few falls over the cliff as the walrus herd moved away from the haulout.\n\n    The lie being told by Attenborough and the film crew is that 200-300 walruses fell during the time they were filming, while in fact they filmed only a few: polar bears were responsible for the majority of the carcasses shown on the beach below the cliff. This is, of course, in addition to the bigger lie that lack of sea ice is to blame for walrus herds being onshore in the first place.\"\n\nAccording to the Atlantic, Lori Quakenbush of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game as well as others knowledgeable about walrus behavior noted that this behavior has actually been witnessed before:\n\n    Quakenbush and others also doubt that the climbs and falls are related to climate change, because such tragedies have been reported since before sea ice showed substantial declines. ‚ÄúWalruses have shown similar behavior on the U.S. coastline when space and ice were not an issue, and the reason is unknown,‚Äù says Lori Polasek from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

The damage is accelerating at an alarming rate. \n\nSoon there will be no ice caps left. The rain will no longer come to those animals who depend on it in dryer climates. The bird migrations will stop around the globe, krill will disappear, therefore fish will disappear and the damage will keep climbing the food chain, till what's left after that? Just us on a floating rock in space that was once a beautiful world that thrived for millions and millions of years which we started to destroy the moment we learnt how to create fire. \n\nWith the polar ice caps melting we are losing our reflective shield that is protecting our planet from the rays of the sun. Without the ice caps, this world would turn into a silent desert lifeless rock, a reflection of Mars in a matter of years.

The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years.\n\nIt's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy output would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.\n\nIndeed, studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity is thought to have triggered the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland was largely cut off by ice from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.\n\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n\nSince 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the Sun either remained constant or increased slightly.\n\nIf the warming were caused by a more active Sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.\n\nClimate models that include solar irradiance changes can‚Äôt reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "John Liddell", "channel": "UCBQ_k0cp--pIWyEur5D3Q-Q", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSSSjJQyxmlNdWPFuw2ivE_iPmhJLr9EhNGDyuoUZs=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

People say it is fear porn and they are pushing the \"climate change agenda\" with a scripted description of something that was happening which had nothing to do with climate change at all!?

Maybe head over to NASA and listen to intelligent people with years of data and studies rather than Alex Jones.\n\nIt's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy output would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.\n\nIndeed, studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity is thought to have triggered the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland was largely cut off by ice from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.\n\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n\nSince 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the Sun either remained constant or increased slightly.\nIf the warming were caused by a more active Sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.\nClimate models that include solar irradiance changes can‚Äôt reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "John Liddell", "channel": "UCBQ_k0cp--pIWyEur5D3Q-Q", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSSSjJQyxmlNdWPFuw2ivE_iPmhJLr9EhNGDyuoUZs=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Maybe you should take your own advice and read through your replies to the other commenters. I'm calling you closed minded not because of the discussion between you and me alone, I'm calling you closed minded because all you're doing is denying what the majority of scientists say is happening and you're arguing with people without providing any sort of evidence as to why you deny this reality. The very fact that you're grasping at your so called \"Intellectual honesty\" mindset, proves you have no desire to better understand why we believe this is actually happening. And yet here you are, still ignoring the fundamental question I've been asking since the beginning of our discussion. And you probably still won't answer my question. I think that's a pretty good example as to why I'm calling you closed minded. I would have thought someone who is \"intellectually honest\" with himself would at least have the respect of providing evidence to prove why he's in so much denial of this reality.

For example, a decrease in solar activity is thought to have triggered the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland was largely cut off by ice from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.\n\nBut several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:\n\nSince 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the Sun either remained constant or increased slightly.\nIf the warming were caused by a more active Sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.\nClimate models that include solar irradiance changes can‚Äôt reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "John Liddell", "channel": "UCBQ_k0cp--pIWyEur5D3Q-Q", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSSSjJQyxmlNdWPFuw2ivE_iPmhJLr9EhNGDyuoUZs=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Vegans live an average of 10+ years in some areas of the world! \n2) If everyone stopped eating meat, we would cut carbon emissions HUGELY because a massive amount of our emissions comes from farming of animals- methane etc. \n3) If everyone stopped eating meat we would no longer be growing food to FEED THE ANIMALS, in fact, we have enough food to end world hunger LITERALLY RIGHT NOW- but it's going to feeding animals to farm.\n\nHey! You might be thinking 'ugh Veganism is soooo expensive', but you have to remember- you'll no longer be buying expensive meat/fish- therefore your food costs will be equal or LESS than before, as your diets will be far more vegetable-orientated!\n\nWhen I first stopped eating meat, 3 years ago, I PHYSICALLY felt different. I have no reason to lie. I physically felt uplifted, its hard to explain!
