Add to this ALL energy created by all forms of renewable. All of this air and energy gets directed at a factory designed to be a liquid air battery. However, this new liquid air battery storage that comes very close to lithium for power density required that we compress and cool air to a certain point..That point is far beyond the liquifying point of co2. So basically, in turning all of our renewable energy into stored liquid air, we get to remove 100% of the co2 into liquid form completely free as a byproduct!!!\n\nWe can then use this pure, clean liquid co2 to replace all other forms of liquid co2 production for commercial use (fizzy drinks e.t.c) and the rest can be stored in thinwall tanks.\nWe can use it mainly for co2 enrichment of carbon sequestering plants and trees that we can then compost and turn into beautiful soil to replace all of the damaged and eroded soil we have destroyed using modern agriculture globally. which will also allow us to increase the planets arable land which will allow us to grow even more food and forests and carbon sequestration.\n\nAlso, the liquid air can be used in new ways based on old technologies. We can replace fully electric cars and hybrid cars with liquid air hybrids. The liquid air can power a Nicola Tesla Turbine that can produce electricity for the electric vehicle. And we only need a small battery for acceleration and power smoothing and as such it can be made from far simpler, more common materials that are greener and more recyclable, such as the Edison battery or a more modern version...Eco friendly is more important than energy density.

Even if the entire planet decided to go with that plan..We are producing a mind numbing amount of carbon every year, we are also producing a stupid amount of new humans each year too. The Arctic has now officially become a source of carbon rather than a sink and the Amazon is virtually at its tipping point towards Forest death.

The masses simply do not understand that for the last half a century, climate change was miniscule, but exponential. We are now at the point that each new doubling of trouble will be massive and noticable. And in the blink of an eye it will be devastating to our every day life and civilization will not be able to continue as normal.\n\nYes we need to rewild the entire planet, but for it to survive, we need to shrink as a species, shrink our consumption and level of luxury and incentivise as many humans as possible into growing food and trees and other crops suited to rapid sequestration as new soil. The economy and business as usual will collapse, but with so many humans growing food and lumber, we might all be broke, but we will have full bellies and a roof over our head during the transition...And while we still have an advanced civilization that is capable of mobilization, the rest of our industry should be all hands on deck providing direct air capture and transitioning to 100% renewable and recyclable everything.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Giga Bane", "channel": "UC4vGklF89mwJ3aLggy3Anag", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRN9zxVC1erVLdv2dpe39Q-y1Dqth5W_dkt5cEW=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I am a fellow citizen journalist at cleanttechnica.com  if you want to collaborate let me know.  I am a retired (disabled) science teacher and full-time environmental advocate.  not quite an expert but I do what I can to educate others on climate change specifically renewable energy and the economics of renewable energy.  I think to not have plan b-z for the coming climate catastrophe is inane.  as an environmental advocate, I think it's important that you do what you are doing.  the environmental community has to have hope to succeed.  too many of us fall into nihilism.  its a tough call, but I think its important to selectively talk about negative emissions.  its a high debatable issue full of nuance, but what can we actually do?  the powers that be are not doing enough.  the scientific community needs to have multiple contingency plans, and I disagree with the common view of many environmentalists who think we should not even discuss negative emissions.  I respect your work and hope you will continue getting these ideas to your audience, which I feel is the perfect target audience.   Do I want the concept of negative emissions on the front page of every major media?  I am not sure exactly, probably not.  however, I think it must at least be discussed with a narrower audience.  it's hard to know what are next step forward is, science and technology are evolving so fast.  I would like to share this article of mine with you.  it discusses the ideas similar to this conversation.  I have been researching negative emissions, but have yet to cover it.

Scientists do their best, but we are only lowly humans and this is our first time as a species trying to second guess an entire plants climate system. Huge volumes of the expected heat have vanished into the oceans and the planet is doing a remarkable job of stepping up to mitigate the harm. And that is not even accounting for bought and paid for scientists muddying the waters and media sensationalizing outlying papers and views. I am a climate 'fanatic' I have spent thousands of hours over the last decade just studying all the variables, you will find few rational people about that believe more than I do and yet even I know that London underwater right now is ludicrous. It would take the Antarctic melting to do that and we are a long way from that. before that happens we will have to deal with the Arctic going through several blue ocean years.  Even with that however, things really are starting to ramp up, current Arctic ice loss is on par this year with the worst year ever recorded and it is not even an el nino year. and the weather around the world is frankly getting quite brutal. No scientist can ever be fully confident about what calamity will hit what part of the world, the earths climate systems are simply too massive for certaintly when treading on new ground that our species has never dealt with before...\nBut just last month, a third of bangaledesh was under water from flooding.

These states are well documented...and the models, which all use radically different input assumptions, are clearly incorrect.  And of course, rice, a staple for much of the world, grows far faster in a high CO2 environment.  \n\nIn the end, its entirely unnecessary to scrub CO2 from the air.  All we would need to do is drastically reduce emissions.  There are some easy outs, but ironically they've been vilified.  That's because this isn't a movement based on logic and reason.  Its an ideology, a nature cult often bound up with unrealistic dreams of a socialist paradise that can never come.  Otherwise what we'd do, is start fracking like crazy to get at all of that cleaner burning methane, causing an immediate drop in emissions.  And then we'd transition to nuclear, using the fracked gas for peaking plants.\n\nBut again, an ideology, and an unhinged one at that.  They push wind/solar, which would take 5x the labor/materials of nuclear and which would actually cause far more pollution...and that's before we have to build the massive battery bank that's over 100X larger than the capacity all the batteries than have ever been built on earth.

Looking at the methodology, it shows a horrendous way of creating statistics.  But let's not discuss this by referring to the degree of consensus. IPCC shows that we had several warm periods over the last 6-8000 years, and the most recent one 800 years ago. This fact is undisputed. The CO2 levels at those times were significantly lower than now.  Did you know that the arctic ice was melting at an alarming pace around 1900?  At less than 300 ppm..  Did you know that U.S. and Soviet scientists were very worried about the coming of a new Ice age, in the mid 1970's ? We had a record heat period in the start of the 1930's. We had a cooling period from the mid 1940's to the end of the 1970's and most graphs brought forward by the concerned, but misled public, starts around 1981, which was the start of the upturn after the cooling period. So how do you find the correlation between CO2 and temperature, during these periodical swings?  And which scientists do you listen to? The ones saying CO2 is the villain, and we will all drown within the next 30 years? Global sea levels have increased at a steady rate since 1850.  Someone seems to be pushing a political agenda.   Although I am all in favor of reducing pollution, it is better to concentrate on that task, by transitioning from coal/gas fired plants to Thorium reactors. That is the intelligent solution.  Solar and Wind power suffer huge disadvantages in terms of intermittency and power density. (Solar requires 450 times more land to produce the same amount as a nuclear power plant) . CCUS can not save the planet from global warming, as CO2 does not play the role which is the prerequisite for such a solution.", "time": "4 months ago", "author": "Tor E.

By stating such illogical drivel is to ignore the basic fact of temperature control and NASA's data is only relevant when it upholds the CAGW hypothesis.\n\nAs already explained solar output is considered a CONSTANT so cannot have been declining for the past 50 years. What is varying, as already explained, on a cyclical basis of 11, 14 and 20 years are the activities on the Sun which are not constant and directly affect the Earth's temperature both when such activity is at a maximum and minimum which does explain the NATURAL variability in Earth's temperature but which AGW alarmists dismiss.

Dr. Svensmark has shown that there are powerful correlations worldwide between solar activity and climatic cycles, and so the sun is clearly playing a role in combination with the cosmic ray radiation as already explained. Hundreds of studies confirm this.\n\nBefore you start typing your bullshit I suggest you look at the NASA chart regarding mean global temperature and you will find it covers a period far longer period than Feb 2016- Dec 2020 but since my statement was that the Temp had declined by 0.7 degree centigrade in the period from 2016 the chart is valid.

There are one billion cows force-reproduced (raped by humans) even adolescent ones. Cows produce 1/3 of all farmed animals greenhouse gas emissions, animal farming makes 15% of all human caused emissions. \nAnimal agriculture is causing: 1/3 of pandemics, 15% greenhouse gas emissions, 2 acres (0.8ha) of Amazon forest ruined each second to grow animal feed exported globally, causing 1 entire species extinct each minute, day and night. \nAnimal agriculture is responsible for 1/4 of freshwater consumption in the world, contaminating more.\nAnimal Agriculture and Aquaculture accounted for 131,000 tonnes or 76% of antibiotic use worldwide.\n80% of all antibiotics in the US are for farmed animals - not to treat illness but to maximise growth and cut on stress.\nAntibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, it will cause 10 million human deaths per year and trivial conditions will become severe. \nMajor health problems in the world are caused by carnism.\nCholesterol kills 870,000 people per year, it is only found in animal products.\nA farm with 2,500 cows produces the same amount of waste as a city of 411,000 people.\n2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce 1 pound of beef.\nAnimal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of the Amazon rainforest destruction.\nAnimal agriculture comes at a dire cost to wildlife, causing habitat destruction and biodiversity loss.\nAnimal agriculture causes ocean dead zones due to overfishing, pollution and climate change which is ruining marine ecosystems.\nFishing has wiped out 90% of the world's large fish.\nApprox. 300,000 dolphins, whales, and porpoises are killed by fishing operations every year.\nDumping the fishing gear (640,000 tonnes per year) is by far the deadliest form of marine plastic. Dwarfing the straws.\n$35 Billion in subsidies goes to the fishing industry worldwide - paying for bigger ships, more fuel, fishing licences, and the capture of even more marine life. \nFor comparison, NASA's budget is $22 billion.\nGlobally there are $500 billion of agricultural subsidies (taxpayers' money) for animal agriculture each year, that equals nearly 1 million dollar a minute. Plus it's causing the same if not more damage and things you can't put a price on. \nDo animals feel pain? Watch Dominion on youtube, cruelty warning: it shows what's on the plate, including \"free range\" and \"humane slaughter\".\nIf you eat eggs, then you pay for male chicks to be minced alive, they are a by-product of force reproducing hens. Hatcheries kill hundreds of millions of newborn male chicks every year.\nIf you eat milk then male calves are slaughtered at birth, female babies taken away so they don't drink \"your\" milk. \"Happy meal\" and ice-cream for kids contains that pain. Cows mourn for days and they can't forget for a longer time. You put their milk in coffee, because oat milk is too weird.\nVegan alternatives are on the shelves, just one your decision saves cruelty.\n\n86% of all land mammals are now livestock or humans.\nHuge land usage of livestock - it provides just 18% of calories but takes 83% of farmland.\nMajority of crops are fed to animals.\nAvoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.\nWithout meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife. \nMajor decrease in the number of wild bees is a result of their biodiverse habitats destruction for farming.\nThe farmed bees are selectively bred, they outcompete the natural ones which die off and plants get badly pollinated, it puts at risk the entire ecosystem.\nPrevent dangerous climate change, reduce pandemic risk, and protect animals. Veganism is easing the stress put on the planet by animal agriculture. If you dispose trash properly, recycle, conserve resources, care about clean water and atmosphere then veganism is the top one thing you could do. Go vegan, it's the most effective thing to do for the environment.\nGlobally switching to a whole food plant based diet has the potential to return millions of acres of land to wild habitat, to restore rainforests, to restore the health and volume of our freshwater rivers and lakes, to prevent further species extinctions, to eliminate billions of tons of pollutants (cow dung, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and ammonia), and to make a major contribution to stabilising and reversing climate change. Gradually as people become conscious of the ethical, environmental, economic, and health benefits then they will find the motivation to choose a plant based lifestyle. \nThere is no nutritional need for humans to eat any animal products; all of our dietary needs, even as infants and children, are best supplied by an animal-free diet.\nPeople eat only a selection of species and find disgusting and immoral to do the same to the rest of animal species.\nCarnivore diet is not a personal preference. It is inflicting harm on all people, animals and the planet.\nBeing vegan cuts your carbon footprint in half.\nIf all people were vegan our global warming footprint would be reduced by 28%\nA vegan diet would reduce the EU’s agricultural emissions by 70%.\nEach vegan saves 1,100 gallons (4100 l) of water each day.\nEach vegan saves 45 pounds (20kg) of grain each day.\nEach vegan saves 30 animals each month.\n\nSo many world problems would be fixed with you reaching for a plant-based product from the shelf next time you shop.\n\nVeganism is natural for our digestive system. There are some vegans from birth, but most vegans were raised as omnivores, then they understood what is going on. 30 million people chose to be vegan + 50 million are nearly-vegan. Miss Universe and Germany's Strongest Man are vegan. \n\nPlants have protein. 1/3 of animals are herbivores including a horse, rhino, bison, gorilla and elephant. Omnivores also take lots of protein from plants.\n\nLove Animals?\nLet's be clear... 99% of animal abuse happens because ordinary people pay for it to happen.\nHumans are perfectly fine to be herbivores. With substitutes getting better each year it's easier to switch to a vegan lifestyle. It's 21st century, cruelty to people, animals and the planet can be greatly reduced.\n\n\"Don't talk of love and peace when you have a dead animal on your plate\" - Socrates\n\n\"One day the absurdity of the almost universal human belief in the slavery of other animals will be palpable. We shall then have discovered our souls and become worthier of sharing this planet with them.\" \n\nMost politicians are not leaders. Politicians do only what voters like so they get re-elected. Leaders always do the right thing.\nLet's  tax meat and dairy. Divert subsidies to educate people and improve vegan food, we could easily replicate the taste.\nAmerican Diet Association, British Diet Association and NHS confirm that a vegan diet can support healthy living in people of all ages.\nAll animals deserve protection, including those that are abused for \"food\" while plant-based alternatives are available.\n\nThanks for reading. I know you won't change. It's easier to convince an alcoholic to become sober. For a carnist it takes on average a dozen of times TRULY admitting to themselves that veganism makes sense before they make any change. \nThe world is going to be vegan sooner or later. \nYour offsprings will be vegan.

Over 20 major volcanoes have blown since April 2018.  There are massive supervolcanoes under Siberia along the Arctic rim and under New England, per geologists.  \n^^ -- Greenhouse Effect in the atmosphere is primarily due to CLOUDS and HUMIDITY.\n^^ -- A molecule's REACH for capturing incident heat photons is limited to the electron orbiting radius of its second highest stable orbit.  The highest stable orbit is where the electron jumps when it absorbs the photon.  If it absorbs the photon at the highest orbit, the electron takes off, ionizing the molecule.\n^^ -- There are only 4 carbon dioxide gas molecules per 10,000 air molecules, far too sparse to trap heat photons.  The photons zip right by, hitting oxygen and nitrogen molecules, which are poor absorbers.\n^^ -- Clouds are capable of blocking solar radiation, which has wavelength about 1,000,000 times shorter than heat radiation wavelength.  Clouds can block heat radiation very easily.  \n^^ -- The wavelength of solar HEAT radiation is about 0.5 micron.  For Earth heat radiation, the wavelength is 15 microns.

Electric cars have their own problems I think we should be sticking with the ICE engines burning this fuel. It burns extremely cleenly no contaminants.

Also, CO2 is an essential part of the atmosphere. Plants require about 150 ppm to exist and are happiest with around 1000 ppm of CO2. So, what is a good level of CO2? If CO2 is heavier than O2 (3.8 times) and O2 has trouble getting high in at atmosphere, just visit Denver, then how does CO2 get to an altitude where it causes problems (airplanes, and thermals)? So which is the worse pollutant? I've read that it is not CO2 but that it is water vapor.  Why aren't we looking at that? I am not denning climate change, but I think it is much more complex than just blaming CO2.  To make matters more complex, if you look at the NOAA temperature data for the last million years ,you will see that the earth goes through rapid temperature swings every 100,000 years or so.

{"cid": "UgzjD-w4Tp1VLPi4vpJ4AaABAg", "text": "What about all the christmas trees that are cut down and discarded every year? They could be used to make OSB, a building material similar to plywood, which would tie up the carbon for as long as the buildings that use it last. Then when the building is demolished, the rubble could be bricked and buried. Actually, the wood currently used to make OSB comes from fast-growing trees on tree farms - a more efficient method of CO2 capture than just planting trees, since mature forests reach an equilibrium between photosynthesis and respiration and natural decay which produce CO2. Then there are algae, which can be grown using sewage, water and atmospheric CO2, and multiply rapidly. They need little light, so they can be farmed vertically. They can be skimmed off and processed into biofuel, or just burned, which would at least be carbon-neutral. The same goes for waste biomass, like sawdust and waste wood produced by sawmills, which could be burned and used to power the mills. Garbage could also be incinerated cleanly at high temperatures, with catalytic converters sequestrating toxic combustion products, solving the problems with landfills and non-biodegradable plastics. The CO2 from burning biomass can be used to feed algae; there is even some species that produces hydrogen. As to the argument that it's an excuse for fossil fuel companies to keep pumping: they will keep pumping as long as there is demand, and we can use all the tools we can find. An unheralded contribution to reducing CO2 is the steady improvement in the efficiency of ICE engines, offset by the popularity of trucks and SUVs. EVs are all very well for the automobile industry, but there is no viable alternative as yet to fossil fuels for ships and aviation. More efficient engines and slower speeds help. There is some experimentation using sails to supplement engine power for ships. Maybe dirigibles could make a comeback? They could feasibly be powered electrically. He is a limited resource, but maybe H2 can be used for flotation, with effective fire-suppressant technology to prevent another Hindenburg disaster. One more hidden unheralded contribution to CO2 reduction is the internet, which cuts down on the amount of travelling people have to do. Average miles travelled have been steadily decreasing for a while, and covid has created a major shift from brick-and-mortar stores and workplaces. Progress is being made on many fronts, and every little bit helps.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "WilliamOccamensis", "channel": "UC0XqHX37B0M5ELOfkowCJcA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSdHXxlXhpUWJHn-T_FISQ__wQZEnILJ0_cGwME=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxWfaMJKnc_gf4zxFZ4AaABAg", "text": "Erm...you lost me at \"this is a technology we need to take seriously.\"  (For a channel called \"undecided,\" you seem pretty decided.)\n\nTrue, we simply must stop polluting our environment with industrialised efficiency.  The debris with which we have littered our planet is simply awesome, because lots of people have been doing it for lots of time.  (Heck, archaeology wouldn't know half of what it does about long-lost cultures if they didn't throw things away.)   The loss of the Aral Sea wasn't to \"climate change,\" it was politics and agriculture and mismanagement.  Most of the western United States used to be under water, which is why you can find massive fields of seashells in Utah, a thousand miles from ocean.  Shall we grieve over lost species of mollusk or trilobite?  \nNo.\n\nThings Change.\n\nThe \"climate\" is constantly changing.  In the age of dinosaurs, you would not have recognised the continents' configuration.  There were higher levels of carbon dioxide to allow plants to grow fast enough to support the voracious plant-eaters, and higher amounts of oxygen to power the megafauna of the time.  (Jurassic Park forgot to show the dinos asphyxiating because it wouldn't make as good a film.)  Then an asteroid came in for a closer look and changed the climate.  8000 years ago, it started getting warmer, and the sea levels rose significantly.  Continent-straddling glaciers turned into valley-filling seas.  Species came and went.  Just look at the ice core data.  Change is the only constant, and even the sun's output changes over time.\n\nHow do we responsibly answer the threat of CO2 levels? First, we establish that it IS in fact a threat. Sherwood Idso's research in the '80s (https://res.cloudinary dot com/highereducation/image/upload/w_740,h_541,c_scale,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1/TheBestSchools.org/Figure-16) suggests it is not (the photo linked shows faster tree growth with increasing levels of CO2.) Additionally, CO2 concentrations aboard US submarines (which stay submerged for six months at a time) average 4000ppm, and get as high as 8000ppm; ten to twenty times the current concentrations. Plants respond better to increased CO2. If you've never seen it, just fly over the Netherlands at night and notice the swaths of greenhouses that flood the winter sky with light. In addition to light, they keep the CO2 levels extremely high so the tulips can be bloomed in time to be cut and shipped around the world in time for the first day of spring. (You can also search \"Netherlands greenhouses night\" and find images.)\n\nBut the argument starts something like this: CO2 levels have increased from about 280 ppm to 390 ppm over the past 150 years or so, and the earth has warmed by about 0.8 degree Celsius during that time. (eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/archive/gg04rpt/pdf/tbl3.pdf)  Therefore the warming is due to CO2. But correlation is not causation. Roosters crow every morning at sunrise, but that does not mean the rooster caused the sun to rise. The sun will still rise on Monday if you decide to have the rooster for Sunday dinner.\n\nWe might also track the levels of the oceans to see if there's an effect there. NOAA data from 375 long-term trend tide stations is publicly available, and their changes have been linear. Have a look at one I happen to have in hand: NOAA 8628660, 960-065, PSMSL 399 at Portsmouth, Virginia (here's a link to the data, http://sealevel.info/MSL_graph.php?id=8638660). The net change across that station has been linear for most of a century since it started; about 3mm per year. The thickness of 24 sheets of paper in your printer.\nNow look at Neah Bay, Washington (http://sealevel.info/MSL_graph.php?id=9443090) It has also moved about 150mm in 50 years, but it went down.\n\nOr look at Port Angeles, Washington, where it has risen less than one millimeter in 40 years.\nKeep clicking that blue triangle to flip through other stations; that green line in all of them is CO2. Note the sea level vector line is wholly unaffected by CO2 rise.\nRemember, tides change as the earth spins under the gravitational influences of the moon and sun. In the Bay of Fundy (Canada,) the difference is 50 feet between high tide and low tide, and it has nothing to do with \"global warming!\"\n\nOops, I mean \"climate change\"...but they changed that hyperbole when it was not all found to be warming, meaning some places are cooling.\n\nAl Gore started this twenty years ago; If the sea levels were rising even an inch a year, the \"ground floor\" (so to speak) of Venice would be underwater.  Their feet aren't even wet!  (A bigger problem is that Venice's wood pilings are rotting and sinking.)\n\nHumans have been on the planet for...in round figures...say, six million years? Look at the ice core data for CO2 levels and compare that with temperature data, or with sea levels. We've persisted without our technological innovations for at least that long because the three have nothing whatever to do with each other. Don't take anyone's word for it, get the raw data and perform your own analysis. The GISP2 research is quite revealing; search for images of it and you can see the thermal changes that took place during the Medieval Warm Period, the Roman Warm Period - and others - for yourself.\n\nAssume for a moment that carbon dioxide is a problem.  (Spoiler:  carbon MONOxide is a problem, and that does come from petrol cars.)  That means every breathing one of us exhales tonnes of carbon dioxide, and the plants we depend on for food and oxygen in turn depend on carbon dioxide which is not a pollutant!  And people breathing accounts for only a tiny fraction of all breathing animals' CO2 output.  Or should we consider wiping out all the other oxygen-breathers?  Any volunteers?\n\nGot 30 minutes?  Fill your worldview with as many relevant facts as you can find.  W.K.Clifford would surely approve.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG1nEhRQ-H8\nGot another 30 minutes?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssE1c80BBmw&t=22s\nHow about a full-Monty 2 hours?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWXiuJm8sf0&t=5s", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Steve Jordan", "channel": "UCIVf4Tb9msmcVUxNYxUTj1Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTWSJojWRFbsKSIGk2gNzifavrHrpZrNTtstEbIBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We have been lied to for decades regarding global warming and now climate change. now sure, to some degree we can all admit that 7billion people have an impact on the planet, but when there's a history of lying to the public, openly wasted tax dollars to chase 'green tech' that resulted in fraud or bankruptcy ? None of the so called scientific models have been accurate, there's evidence of institutes like NASA and East Anglia manipulating data, there hasn't been in increase in hurricanes or their intensity. And what irritates me is the arrogance of the new generations nearly DEMANDING we change everything now on their schedule (even though they use fossil fuels and related products). As if they were the first to take the planet and conservation serious. Technology finds a better way without the harmful effects and byproducts eventually, at least it is hoped, which is why I do not subscribe to the scam carbon credit programs where polluters are allowed to pay off carbon offsets to continue business as usual, meanwhile some 3rd world village has to use manual labor to earn those credits.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Roger F", "channel": "UC7J1JUkyVNbgXAI52TNXISA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRu1Ir508KazAhn-GZ28KltHxGLhWSHMqfAdO4a=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's not that the video is bad- it's actually quite good, as are most of yours (I say \"most\" as I haven't seen all of them, but have seen quite a few and am making my observation- get this- in that context.)\n\nFirst, I acknowledge that you've taken on a difficult task- explaining this stuff to people in this format- and that should be applauded, and thanked- and I do. I am commenting as my way to try and help you to continue to do that.\n\nWith CCUS, I think there is at least one thing that could have been stressed more in order to provide additional context (which likely contributed to many comments). That is in understanding the role CCUS can and will play (yes, when appropriately used and funded) as one component of a broad strategy of solutions being deployed to combat climate change and the human influence on our planets' climate. You mentioned it, briefly, but it may be to your viewers' benefit to consistently illustrate the relationship between these solutions in each video as you discuss one or several solutions in detail- as you did with this video on CCUS.\n\nI won't list all of those components, but would point you to the ICC (which I'm sure you're already aware of- but ya never know who might read this) and the near-constant (now- but maybe not when this vide was first published) news coming from both international inter-governmental and public-private organizations, many third party independent watchers as well as from many governments, themselves. (Yes, having an audit trail and mechanism is important, too- and that is also being worked on- and making progress.)  \n\nI think the context-kicker could be done with a few graphics both at the beginning and end and could do wonders for viewers who are seeing things... in silos, but not necessarily familiar with the full novel that humanity is now writing. (That makes sense, right?)\n\nAnyhoo... great video. I'm not sure how you could ultimately provide additional context (maybe my suggestion would work, maybe it wouldn't)- but I am enjoying one of the best closed-loop approaches to story telling and independent journalism I have experienced in a long time through The Energy Transition Show with Chris Nelder. Seriously, one episode of his is like a lesson in what OCD might look like (lol/jk). I would never expect anyone to copy his approach, but if you've ever listened to one of his podcast episodes (full length) and seen his notes and noted his use of internal references to other episodes, it's almost mindblowing (and not at all in competition to your efforts... but it does make me wonder whatever happened to webrings... lol).\n\nPlease keep up the great work- and thank you for doing it!", "time": "3 months ago", "author": "Tom Yasko", "channel": "UCjbWaaqvn8S2UGq9HezT6fQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRNCmob-X2MXph8oh_S8BLvKEtEEWrjBj7_bF6Mjg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There's always a tradeoff between a forest's CO2 capture and its CO2 emissions.  Emissions come from decaying organic matter from tree litter, dead trees,the carbon bound up in the soils, from respiration as the tree's oxidize the sugars they make from sunlight, and of course fires.  As temperatures warm and forests burn more the net balance can easily turn from net CO2 sequestration to net CO2 emissions.  Beyond the massive CO2 release of a forest fire, the burn scar exposes the soils to direct sunlight and heat accelerating the decomposition of the organic material in the soils, releasing CO2.  \n\nIn subarctic forests - which are historically some of the best carbon sequestering forests - the melting of the permafrost or early melting of the seasonal frost soils also accelerates CO2 emissions in these carbon rich soils.  \n\nIn rain-forests burning to create arable land can also quickly turn the forests into net carbon emitters.  This is happening more and more often.  Also forests go through life cycles and early and mid life are when forests are most efficient at capturing and sequestering CO2, old growth forests much less so.  \n\nIt's great to have trees in your backyard and on your street, but the heavy lifting in CO2 capture happens in large forests, and warming is reducing their effectiveness considerably.", "time": "2 months ago (edited)", "author": "glibsonoran", "channel": "UC2mIleL9IWU_fWw6v6slVOQ", "votes": "7", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJqC_l5pYZ43ml5ucwVb3s2jwUG-W9JhD-eA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The switch will take over all by itself as it is needed. All this talk of taxes on carbon to reduce global warming is just governments looking for a way to steal from you. Make some people rich and screw the little guy over. IT IS NOT REAL. The materials that make batteries will also eventually run out. They are also NOT really a renewable energy source, as over time they eventually will NOT WORK, and you will NOT be able to make more of them. Solar panels die after 30 years. They will be totally ineffective or not work at all. They are made using CARBON BASED ENERGY.  Solar panels create severe amounts of pollution when created. Google it. Also solar panels actually reflect massive amounts of heat into the atmosphere defeating the entire purpose of reducing the Earth's temperature. Want to know why the snow melts off you solar panel roof faster than the neighbors house with no solar panels. It it because YOU YES YOU are reflecting MASSIVE amounts of heat right back into the environment that would normally be absorbed, into the earth and plants. It is slightly reducing green house co2 but it is MASSIVELY directly increasing GLOBAL WARMING by reflecting heat back into our atmosphere. Do the math on how much heat energy is reflected back into the environment from solar panels as opposed to the amount of heat that is reduced from not putting the co2 into the environment. Earth CAN eat co2 like crazy, Earth can not dissipate massive amounts of heat YOU are directly throwing back into the environment. YOU are INCREASING global warming using solar panels.\n\nAlso, a BATTERY powered car uses WAY MORE energy, thus more heat, than a gasoline powered car.  DIRECTLY INCREASING global warming.

This reaction is the problem though because, like most reactions it goes both ways, meaning that while carbonic acid decays into CO2 and H2O, the water and the carbon dioxide also react and form carbonic acid, and the more of the water and CO2 you have, the more the scale tips toward the production of acid, which desolves in the ocean (as that is where most of the water it needs to form is), which lowers the ph.

For example to make the CaO or CaOH (un-slaked and slaked lime) you need to calcine limestone.  Which uses a lot of energy and releases CO2.  Amines are often derived from ammonia that has to be produced using an energy demanding process called the Harbor Bosch process.  You need to look at the energy balance of chemically sequestering CO2.  To my only partially informed mind it seems like we are trying to develop the chemical equivalent of a perpetual motion machine violating the rules of thermodynamics.  Now if the CO2 is sequestered in some sort of natural salt dome or pours rock that Michu be ok.  Problem there is that carbon dioxide (CO2) plus Water (H2O) yields carbonic acid H2CO3.  Carbonic acid is a mild acid that will eat away at substrate rock (how many natural caves are formed).  \n\nI was hoping you might have examined some of these questions (especially the energy balance of chemical sequestration) and explained how researchers are working around them but, alas neither you nor anyone discussing this issue has explained how these problems have been solved.

Cant have that without us somehow digging the earth and causing eco-system instabilities, the kind that can kill a third of land air and sea. Of course people would be smart enough during these days that apparent mechanisms of indoctrination and borderline slavery becomes crystal clear and feared as oppression since we dont ever feel satisfied or content with other aspects of life. Slavery not because you dont get paid, but because you're allowed little time of your life to be yours, otherwise population explosion. Christianity understands that the main point of life is family life. Materialism takes trunk space not even the backseat. Otherwise \"end of days\" rears its ugly face again. Respect what took countless generations of filtering out the stupid out of people until we supposedly are the smart ones in control by respecting the awe inspiring work of the super natural. understand, the bible warns about the inevitable trend of human ingenuity and the rise and persecution of the main loving individual with knowledge and reason and refreshing common sense that calls for humanity instead of blindly ignoring their humanity for new experiences that aren't necessarily self sustaining. Accept that the bible speaks of trends my friends, and Jesus will always be the one lovingly reminding us about our love towards life. No need to paralyze your own heart and your own access to truth through common sense awareness! My god people wake up from your mental slumber. The bible is about inevitable trends the kind we ought to be more careful about moving forwards. We should grown foods locally by repurposing plastic for hydroponic pods that can be attached to all vertical poles using metal straps. Four pods per row each row can be as little as 6 inches apart if you distance it horizontally as well as vertical, a little, as you move up to avoid it being directly above lower hydroponic pod. We can definitely and MUST definitely take control of food production. It can be a new kind of soicialized job/value instilling effort in the community. We may have tech evolving but our bodies still need proper nutrition in order to think and feel great. \n\nFor energy we can use mountain sides by building rail track that goes top to bottom. Have water pipes at top. Fill train cart with as much water as possible. Utilize a slope to assist in cart acceleration down a tall mountain. The brakes can generate emissions-free electricity while pulling up another cart from the bottom to the top, but empty.... Hopefully... I mean if windmills can be a thing then so can using gravity as a source of energy. Hopefully this should free us to repurpose trash into bricks that we can use to house the homeless using gravity generated energy.\n\nThese options may be sub-optimal to the educated engineer, i understand that i just want to point out that we HAVE OPTIONS!!!! all we need is real unity!", "time": "8 months ago", "author": "AJ GM", "channel": "UCg4AjEwLzd2FQMDtfhGqDlw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ6JlIuSgnHn-sWNFDkjwhWsMthaFrJXZoFHQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal infrared energy.\" \"When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Like coals from a fire that are warm but not glowing, greenhouse gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in ALL DIRECTIONS\". \"Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate heat in ALL DIRECTIONS, some of it spreads downward and ultimately comes back into contact with the Earth’s surface, where it is absorbed. The temperature of the surface becomes warmer than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating of the Earth’s surface by the atmosphere is the natural greenhouse effect.\" Up high or down low, I don't see any difference if NASA is correct. At the height of the Atmosphere, the Earth constitutes 1/3rd of the space. So the IR absorbed by the ghg, both for incoming sun heat and emitted Earth heat, will be absorbed then emitted in \"all directions\". 1/3rd will hit the Earth below and the other 2/3rds will go into space. Of the Earth emitted heat, 1/3rd of that will be absorbed by the ghgs going out, and sent back to the earth adding additional warming to the earth, this warming is the greenhouse effect according to NASA. So, water vapor and the ghgs, cool the earth by blocking out 66.4% of Sun heat, while keeping in only 11% (1/3rd of 1/3rd). The atmosphere keeps out six times more heat than it keeps in. If we add more molecules of CO2 they will absorb more entering sun heat and cool the earth more than they do now. With the earth getting less heat, there will be less heat to keep in, so the GHE should fall.

Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do.  Cheap clean energy is freedom.  23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less.  Solar and wind are energy transfers.  Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space.  I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money!  Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond.  It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up.  Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost.  Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "ballomni", "channel": "UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSu_PGYp6k79oSFOphOwlNS5Wi2I0lOCWhISZo=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This report is old tech. Like so many science media channels now these folks like to tell us what cant be done, or show the results of past failures in an effort to stem problem solving thinking. What is the message there?  in that way its almost anti-science.\n\nWhen we talk about climate change now we should say thats its origins are in the anti-population movements of the 60s. Ecology, Conservation orgs, climatology, hydrology - 'new' science disciplines or sub-disciplines created sciences that didnt study the earth, but our effect on it. So obviously their considered consensus was humans are the problem. Depopulation, was the answer, and has been baked into a lot of physical science ever since. The problem is not our tech, its us, even so in addition to being anti-homo sapien sapien, theyve become anti technology. The tone of this report was 'its foolish to expend more energy to off-set the expense of energy',  (pollution). Even in this climate \"crisis\"? Even if were all going to die?\nWhat message is that to people? \n\nThese carbon capture solutions failed, but the the need is there. Id love to see some folks in this production just lobby some ideas, silly or not, than add to the thick mat of anti- human opinion and conjecture that is smothering natural science and any research, even thought, about science based solutions to problems we've created.\n\nIn the 50s when the anti- human movement started most 3rd world countries were rural people with big families 7+ kids. Since the 90s, even in poorer countries, family size is down to 2 kids per, in 90% of the world. We already know population will level at 11B, so thats our ceiling, around when millemials die off population growth will halt and start receding as there will be less of us having kids too, certain countries in africa will be the only growth - see anything by Hans Roesling.\n\nI got carried away here sorry.

Most will die.  \n\nRemember the movie, \"Idiocracy?\"  Climatologists are like those leading the world in that movie and removing CO2 from the atmosphere will have similar results. \n\nSo when \"brilliant\" boasting alarmists create dust-bowls and famine and they try to blame it on climate-change, remember this scientist warned you what was about to happen.

You misunderstand me.\nThe point of carbon capture is to store it in one or another way.\nThe paper for the production of concrete has one major flaw in the way it is presented here.\nYou need substances that can react with the CO2 to bind it. In the classic way Limestone is used as a binder for the sand and rock. But Limestone is CaCO3. You burn it to get CaO. This reacts with water to Ca(OH)2. And this reacts with CO2 to CaCO3 and water. This is one part why concrete works. This process is responsible for 8-10 % of the worlds CO2 emissions. So its well known, basic and not easy to replace.\n\nWhat was mentioned in the paper was the possebility to use slag from the Iron production as a costruction Material. The point here is, that the thing that reacts with the CO2 is unused CaO that is left in the slag. You put Limestone in the blast furnace to get rid of the unwanted silicates, but in this process CO2 is already emitted. So the only thing you do is to use the not correct calculated excess amount of burned Limestone. This is pure greenwashing. Because the slag is already used as building material and is using the CO2 from the air.\nSo the little bit of extra CO2 that binds in the material is nothing to the extra amount of energy you use to capture the CO2 and transport it. \n\nThe other discripted method of using minerals of the serpentine group is nothing new, but it works. So these are minerals that can bind the CO2 for a Long Time. This is also needed for the CCS sites that want to mineralize the CO2. If its done with renewable energy, you can call it the best way to remove CO2 out of the atmosphere.\n\nI hope this explained the point better than before.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Platz Halter", "channel": "UCHxpvVvra-Qngt8gCr89_hw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRCMpZkMKA8RkEDqZ2DUTtgyBL63cQZU9EzcUCZ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If I'm wrong then I'm wrong. I might be wrong but I'm not. Please think about that volume and mass of liquid and tell me that it is a perfectly reasonable idea to pump it underground or turn it into walls. Are there really that many walls on Earth? Is there an engineer out there who can tell me how big the bath plug needs to be to drain the 1000 X 10 X 1 Km bath in lets say 5 years?  Of course the bath will have to be under a pressure of about 10 bar and so will the place you drain into. I recognise that liquid CO2 would be denser than water, approx = e,  so maybe the bath would ONLY be 400 X 10 X 1 Km.\n  I think that we should calculate the mass of the atmosphere which is really easy to do. 5.15 by 10 to the 15 tonnes, so 10T tonnes would be ONLY  about 0.2% of the atmosphere. There is a bit of a snag here, CO2 levels are at 0.04% of the atmosphere!  So we'll have 50T tonnes of anti-CO2 in the atmosphere and all life will be extinct, relying as it does on CO2. I need help form a physicist here 'does anti-CO2 exist?'. Can anti-plants use anti-CO2 to feed anti-humans (otherwise known as feminists)?\n  The fundamental question is 'Is CO2 bad?' If yes 'how?' and prove it. If not then what are we doing debating putting 0.2% of the atmosphere underground and destroying all life on Earth (as if we had that power).", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Ben Chapple", "channel": "UC2kcz3diFpJ88PfQil2AfBg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRK4cnlIukXurD3vz4niwZh4jh6TeH52uk80A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also they will require less water to grow as they will lose less due to transpiration.

In America the droughts, water shortages and disappearing salt lake beds could all possibly be healed by desalination plants pumping the brine water to the salt lake beds during the “rainy “ season and refilling the aquifers then during the summer the evaporation would fuel the rain for the dry Oklahoma,Nebraska regions making them productive agricultural areas with less irrigation requirements and green earth is cooler earth than the raw dirt.

Nothing in the current OP would make me write what I did.\n\nIn reply to your second part. There is overblown fear mongering  media on climate change this is true. However many many people use this as an excuse to not do research or learn about climate change and push it off as not a big problem or not man made.\nClimate change is man made and is a big problem even if the media and some percentage of politicians make it out to be worse or better than it actually is.

They're also only set to operate for around 25 years, although newer iterations may last longer, after which they require disposal or recycling. Unless properly recycled, solar panels become environmentally toxic waste. Solar farms also take up a considerable amount of land and only really operate during the day. Until more effective storage methods are either finally invented or finally allowed, depending, that's going to be quite an issue.\n\nIn summary, there is a LOT more that needs to be done for solar to actually be an industrial-grade option.

Cook's \"97,5% study\" turned out to be a 2,5% study... CO2 and water vapor are the 2 biggest greenhouse gases, but man makes about 5% of the CO2. CO2 starts to rise after 800-1400 years after the the oceans warm up, so it can't be the driving force. You can now check 800k years back from the ice core drillings and see, that temperature has risen 7 times and just before a new ice age starts. What factories we had 800k years ago? There is nothing wrong with stopping pollution, recycling and consuming less, but the whole CO2 scare is just to make some countries pay tax for all production and some countries paying naught. I live in a 'plastic bag', because law dictates my house needs to have AAA energy grade. Then I need to have AC running 24/7 with electricity, so that my house does not get mold. That power was most likely produced with coal. I need to cash out my kid's college fund to buy a natural gas car and rockefeller's use fracking to get that gas out of the sea bed. Bye bye Great Coral Reef. Btw UNESCO said climate change destroyed the coral reef... If I heat my house by burning wood out of my own forest I am creating micro particles and giving everybody cancer. When UK cuts down forests for they wood burning power plants, it is just \"renewable biomass\".

CCUS has only been used for Enhanced Oil Recovery, literally.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage#Industrial-scale_projects  \nRead the laundry list of EOR as the endgame for CCS and understand it was never a carbon negative strategy and always an excuse to continue burning fossils.  Neoliberals used to call it \"Clean coal\"\n\nIt's all handwaving.  You also made a tragically bad argument in your opening.  You said, \"But renewables alone, aren't enough to lower emissions at the rate that is needed.\"  Wrong.  Take the wasted R&D money and much higher cost of fossils that would go to perpetuating their use with the proven-to-be-useless CCUS strategy, and instead invest that money in actual renewable creation.  Continuing to pretend that CCUS is an actual net-zero carbon strategy for 20 more years will easily cost us more in Climate Crisis related damages and adaptation than it costs to invest heavily in retiring all of the fossil plants.  Our problem is the will to act with the power and speed of a motivated government backed by a motivated society.  We are acting like spoiled children, afraid to interrupt GDP growth with an actual quick government-led strategy.  We have the money, but we've put our commitment to capitalism and the free market over the future of our planet.  \n\n\"The NRG representative also confirmed that the coal unit is continuing to operate without capturing its emissions. So carbon emissions from the power plant have increased – although only slightly, since the project captured just 7% of the power plant’s emissions when it was operating.\"\n\"https://www.energyandpolicy.org/petra-nova/\nPetra-nova is the General Motors, the IBM, GE of the CCS world.  They have shown you that it's not a real strategy.\n\nCCS is being used LESS and LESS.  As an extreme technophile, Matt, you buy into this BS that it's a growing industry or that it will ever make any sense.  DAC has the same problem of being too energy/materials intensive to be energy or financially viable.  It's only being talked about because those who want Business As Usual are paying policy makers to write it into their strategies.  It's sad that people who understand science, can't stop being distracted by future tech while we're in a Climate Emergency.

I don't know much about the details of carbon capture technology, but I am familiar with the second law of thermodynamics, which tells me in no uncertain terms that it will take more energy to recapture the CO2 in stable form than we ever got from burning that carbon in the first place.  Anyone who understands this is not the least bit surprised that carbon capture technology is not being implemented in our smokestacks, because if fossil-fuel-based power plants tried to sequester any meaningful percentage of the carbon they burned, they would defeat their own purpose by becoming net-importers of energy.  For similar reasons, the attitude of \"let's burn it now, capture it later\" is absolute insanity.  LEAVING IT IN THE GROUND is the only sensible policy.  Yes, we should invest in the research and development of carbon capture technology, but it won't make sense to implement large-scale sequestration efforts until our energy supply comes from non-fossil-fuel sources.\n\nIn the long term, sustainable energy is not the moral path forward, but rather it is tautologically, by definition, the ONLY path forward.

But I think we're both on the same page that fossil fuels need to stay right where there are, in the ground, because they are already maximally sequestered.  It takes energy to pull them out of the earth, and it would take even more energy recapture that carbon once it's burned and try to put it back.

Actually, it will be vital to supply us with air, so will micro organisms and bacteria.\nAlso, you can't reverse climate change. Why not, very simple, CO2 isn't the problem, that mixes with the air, it's almost just as heavy, it doesn't pollute our atmosphere at the top, those are lighter greenhouse gasses, like hydrogen for example, Methane, all that junk from your spray cans that supposedly damaged the ozon layer, those gasses actually trap heat from the sun melting ice caps and the north pole, so the sun can heat up more water and more water vapor rises to the top, more methane is released from the bottom of the oceans and permafrost, CO2 is nothing, maybe 2% of the problem, if it is that much. If we want to reverse anything of heat, now it's heat, then it's an ice age again.... then we have to paint everything white, or reflective in the direction of the sun, so it can bounce off instead of heat up. The second reason why, is because of the tilt of the Earth. we're already at a critical point, seasons are already exaggerated. More sun reaches the north pole, it heats up the Earth more, if you have a solution for that, then ok, let's reverse climate change.

{"cid": "UgyhoRy52xAaa9WEpCR4AaABAg", "text": "\"Climate Change,\" aka \"Global Warming\" is not scientific fact BASED ON THE PARAMETERS THAT CLIMATE SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE PROVIDED. Let me say that again,  based on the own measurement parameters that Climate Scientists have put forth, we have NO hard-scientific proof that global warming is occurring.  The entire  increase in aggregate global temperatures claimed by \"climate experts,\" is 0.7 degrees C.  But here is the key, THE MARGIN OF ERROR OF ALL OF THE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS IS 1.0 DEGREES C!  Again, this is the claim that climate scientists are making. So based on hard scientific fact, we don't even know if the aggregate temperature of the earth is increasing.  \n\nThere are something like 7-8 different temperature measurement systems employed by several major agencies that are used to measure the aggregate temperature of the earth. ALL of these different measurement systems introduce a different marginal degree of error  into the total temperature calculations. So it is a safe bet that the actual margin of error of the AGGREGATE  earth's temperature is greater than the 1.0 degrees C that is being claimed by climate scientists! \n\nThe liberal media and groups (read the Democratic Party) pushing the global warming hoax have political goals, driven by the huge amounts of money involved. Al Gore, the high priest of the religion of global warming is now worth over $200 MILLION dollars. His global warming charade has made him fabulously rich.  The amount of money that governments are pushing into this farce is staggering.  The down payment for the Paris Accord that the United States would have had to pay is $4 BILLION  DOLLARS. Under the Accord's clauses, this would rise to over 10 BILLION DOLLARS in less than 10 years. But wait, that's not all, the amount that American taxpayers would be on the hook for under the Paris Accord WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE.  Fortunately, President Trump was intelligent enough to withdraw from this insane agreement. Further, US taxpayers would have been paying the highest amount of costs for this  \"climate accord\" of any country and we have one of the best non-polluting records for large industrial countries, so these astronomical costs were not merited, even IF global warming was occurring. \n\nBTW,  the Paris Climate TREATY is the correct name for what we call the Paris Accord. The reason it was called an \"accord\" in America is because Obama, an extreme leftist, FORCED THE USA INT0 THIS AGREEMENT. Obama KNEW that the \"treaty\" would not be ratified in congress and so he unilaterally forced America into a bastardized \"accord.\" \n\nBut let's directly address Ferrell's claim of increased CO2 emissions: \n\n1. By all accounts C02 emissions have gone up in the last 30 years, but it is VERY questionable whether or not that this is anthroprgenic (caused by man).  There is NO solid proof of that because the earth emits tremendous amounts of C02 naturally.\n\n2. The actual percentage of C02 in the atmosphere is debatable but some have measured it at less than 1% and others up to 0.04%. Think about this critically for a minute. That means of ALL the gases in the atmosphere, the TOTAL amount of C02 os 0.00004.  95% of ALL C02 emissions are natural. So the percentage of that 0.04% is (0.04 x .05) = 0.002% of man made emissions.Think about that number, it is in the hundreds of a percent and yet supposedly intelligent people are saying that it is radically changing our planet's temperature. There are several different explanations online from climate change promulgators, but the their arguments defy commonsense as well as hard science.\n\n3. Add to this the FACT that C02 is just ONE of dozens of greenhouse gases and you quickly begin to realize that even if global warming was real, and it isn't, reducing JUST C02 emissions would have little affect on global temperatures.", "time": "11 months ago (edited)", "author": "FL FL", "channel": "UCbTy5IMNW8dBkPRiBVFwWsA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRR7c2JcwG9qpbKyb8r8RRuiruzsrM9oewQRA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx25VcaJ136yyoWJWd4AaABAg", "text": "Carbon capture would use the energy of 5 units of Fossil Fuel for every unit of Fossil Fuel burned.  Looking carefully at direct air capture in particular assumes the energy comes from excess renewable les that are above the immediate demand due to supply peaks.  The cost of these carbon capture plants will be immense and dwarfed by simply not using Fossil Fuel in the first place.   \n\nWhile most say trees are the answer this is mistaken since if we were to plant every square foot of arable land with trees in one year it would still not equal the amount of carbon emissions produced in that year. Essentially, even if we gave up growing food, trees would not suck up enough carbon dioxide to slow down the increase in an appreciable fashion. I recall it around 90% of the carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean anyway which gives us a false idea as to how much carbon dioxide actually has to be removed since the ocean is acting as a carbon sink and we need another one.\n\nothers have stated that the carbon dioxide should be pumped into greenhouses to make plants grow which is not necessarily true for many plants that have evolved with the existing level of carbon dioxide. For those planes that would thrive in higher concentrations, there are complications such as the requirement for more water and other minerals so it’s not just an easy fix.\n\nI mentioned Direct Air carbon capture which is probably the most expensive process but capturing carbon from coal fired plants would make them even less competitive than they are now since in most cases they already cost more than renewable energy. It would be far better to use that investment to create more renewable energy which would give immediate and long lasting results and not encourage the use of coal which has problems beyond its carbon production such as the toxic byproducts.\n\nBy far the cheapest solution is to start taxing fossil fuels for firstly the healthcare costs they incur which is around $120 billion per year in the US and kills around 110,000 people in the US and around 40 million people worldwide. The fossil fuel industry gets away with pushing those costs onto the general population as it does the environmental costs which globally probably exceed the price of the fossil fuel by a factor of 10. He study at Stanford showed that the cost of burning fossil fuels was around $65 trillion in an $86 trillion world economy meaning that stopping the production and use the fossil fuels as quickly as possible would benefit virtually everybody on the planet. Fossil fuels should only be used as a transition to renewable energy.\n\nWell some countries have place limits on the final date that fossil fuel vehicles can still be produced they are by and large much much much too far in the future to have the effect we need if we intend to drastically lower carbon dioxide in the next 10 years. Pretending that this can be done by carbon capture is a fools errand because the cost of doing so would be dramatically greater than simply switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy along with storage.\n\nLooking at the issue from first principles makes the situation much clearer. The earth has been storing carbon in fossil fuels for several billion years so to pretend that we can release these in one century and not suffer the toxic consequences is absurd.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Colin Genge", "channel": "UC-KFO4IHqbnguKjsqBs_jPQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQQrr-crt0VCZtfNv2-SVxZMWdVJ-qn4Xlainy8BA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

About the latter, most animals are raised for meat so that's human induced. The natural balance would have a lot less animals alive, that includes humans.\nForest fires : science tells us that forest fires are gaining in strength due to human activity, they way we manage forests and global heating. Ironically not letting forest burn naturally, monoculture and clear cutting leads to much more massive fires.\nGlobal heating may well be a big part of a natural cycle but we're contributing to accelerating that cycle and the unbalance is exponential, it's a vicious circle. Also \"real\" natural CO2 emissions are balanced out naturally by natural carbon storage.

Global warming doesn't mean everywhere heats up, some get cooler, while many get dryer other gets wetter etc. Globally it gets warmer, the same quantity of water circulates thru the atmosphere but get erratic distribution. Not only are their direct consequences on human life, there is also the more dramatic effects of the unbalance that becomes exponential thus speeding up. Also figures hide certain aspects, where I live the rainfall is lowering under the safe limit but worst is the rain we get now comes in all at once in 2 or 3 huge annual downfalls creating havoc. Meanwhile 93% of the local forests are dead within 5 years (70% of my territory is forest) and the wood is barely even good enough for shoving in a stove ! then these 2 factors meet up the hills we be sliding down on us !\nIt's a vicious circle and neatly putting figures in little boxes doesn't solve it !

We won't stop burning fossil fuels until we have a viable substitute.  Wind and solar probably won't get there (I would like to be wrong, but I just don't see it).  Nuclear Fusion, particularly P-B11 fusion would certainly do it... If only we could make that work (and work in a cost effective manner).  There are some promising developments here, but it still looks to be 10+ years away, so this probably shouldn't be relied upon.  Today's Nuclear Light Water Reactors (LWRs) could do it, but they have costs and waste issues.  The waste issue seems to be overblown... It just isn't as bad as the hype makes it out to be.  The cost issue really comes down to regulations and \"inherent\" safety.  This is a complex issue, but the bottom line is that the cost of any Nuclear (Fission) Power generating system is very much driven by the INHERENT safety aspects of the reactor design.  Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are a newer, generation IV, type of reactor that is MUCH safer by INHERENT design.  (A simple google search on Molten Salt Reactors or MSRE will yield much info here).  If we had NRC regulations in place for MSRs that are much easier (lower cost) to comply with (because these regulations efficiently reflect the MSRs inherent safety advantages), MSRs could be constructed and operated at a much lower cost.  The 10X cost increase that has occurred over the years for LWRs could be reduced or eliminated with MSRs.  MSR look promising as a method to produce energy at a fraction of today’s costs (and a HUGE reduction in the waste produced as well).  With MSRs we can produce MUCH more energy!  The energy available in nuclear fuels (Uranium or Thorium) is a Million times that of any fossil fuel.   With energy this abundant, we can solve many of the worlds resource limitation problems!  The standard of living for all people on earth can increase many fold.  The potential advantages of MSRs are simply stunningly!  We would stop producing CO2 and putting it into the air.  We could even extract CO2 from the air in a means discussed in the video.  Or, we could simply grow trees and harvest them and store them in old coal mines... Reversing the processes of coal burning that has taken place of the past 200+ years.  Since plants actually thrive in relatively high CO2 environments, we would have to determine the optimum level of CO2 in the atmosphere.

When you explain that all these politics about CO2 only increase energy cost, if people are still believing climate change, then they are brainwashed. At is worse IF models are true, climate changes would only means a fraction a GDP that would be less that standard GDP,  but a GDP HIGHER  than one of 2020...  So who cares?

{"cid": "Ugw4UPQgrotzFlqPJsh4AaABAg", "text": "Another video missing the mark completely. You can keep improving your carbon capture technologies as much as you want. The reason they will not pan out is because of plain simple chemistry, physics, logistics and ultimately economics.\n\nLet's take a tonne (1000 kg) of thermal coal as an example. When combusted, that 1 ton of coal results in about 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide (2,860 kg). This is because coal is mostly carbon atoms bonded with hydrogen atoms. Combustion is an oxidation reaction which will bond those carbon atoms with 2 oxygen atoms. So each CO2 compound will now have a molar mass of 44 vs carbon on its own of just 12.\n\nBut it gets worse. Not only do you have to deal with almost three-times the mass but it's also now a gas that must be cooled and compressed in order to be transported. This requires energy and enormous amounts of infrastructure.\n\nNow think of all the mines and drill sites that are extracting oil, coal and natural gas all over the world. Think of the major engineering and costs that are required these days to extract those commodities.\n\nNow multiply the mass involved by three,  change the substance into a gas that must be compressed in order to be transported, and try to run that whole system in reverse - Pumping CO2 back into the ground. Think of the massive costs and engineering required.\n\nThat's why it won't work. Not because it's hard to extract the CO2 from the plant's smoke stack. But because it would be way way cheaper if we just didn't combust the fossil fuel in the first place than it is to put its CO2 back into the ground after doing it or transforming it into a useful material.\n\nCarbon capture is definitely possible. But economically storing it? You'd likely have to double or triple the cost of the fuel to pay for the infrastructure to put the CO2 back. And if you do that then you'd quickly find that it's cheaper to not burn it at all and find alternative sources of energy than to implement carbon capture.\n\nYou're much better off enacting a carbon tax on your economy and letting businesses and society find all the cheap, easy, low-hanging-fruit abatement measures.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Gerardo Flores", "channel": "UCl40BnftYvEMZq8C4uQRz1g", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbuYi0bEEZAT5hMbDKP9Qg9unjHxpDNQsb6zT4xJM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyInNqaelW3lF3ZKWd4AaABAg", "text": "1. Carbon capture from fossil fuel plants is a BAD idea. Coal is on the way out, and every dollar put into capturing carbon from the flues of those plants is a dollar better invested in something else, such as renewable energy or better efficiency. The same is true for gas, to a somewhat reduced degree. A big problem with gas is that the plants are generally much smaller, so it's a non-starter there as well. BTW I'm assuming we're electrifying transportation IAC, so it's just a question of what kind of electricity generation plants to use. Carbon capture from ICE vehicles is obviously not feasible.\n\n2. Direct air capture is a GOOD idea. In fact, it's going to have to happen, and on a huge scale. But it shouldn't be ramped up much until renewables are the dominant energy source. Otherwise, the expense will slow the transition to those renewables, while at the same time facilitating continued use of coal.\n\nDirect air capture needs to mostly be done with machines. A lot of this could possibly be driven by waste heat from industrial operations. IAC this can be scaled up to the necessary levels. This is not true of BECCS, planting trees, or other biologically based solutions, all of which require too much land, and possibly too much labor as well, and are likely to have a variety of other environmental effects as well. Air capture machines can be set up using very little land, possibly even underground. This is a huge advantage.\n\n3. Incorporating CO2 into concrete—hmmm, sounds interesting. I had not heard of this idea before. But I wonder if it could be done on enough of a scale to lock up a large part of the existing CO2 excess.

{"cid": "Ugxd7GdRqP9XvF8Bl9d4AaABAg", "text": "I actually spent 5 yrs of my life researching (i.e. in the actual lab) carbon capture, back when it was called CCS - carbon capture and sequestration (at a conference I went to they said we should stop using sequestration as it is too fancy of a word for the general public to understand). We worked with a lot of the big (and small) companies in this field and even got a $8M DARPA grant for our work.\n\nHere's the problem, most carbon capture technology uses an amine solvent (like MEA, monoethanolamine) to capture CO2. You then have to desorb the CO2 by heating it to high temperatures, which takes a lot of energy and then compress it for storage, which also takes a lot of energy. The models we and others developed showed about half the power generated in a typical coal fired power plant would go to the CO2 capture and compression. We worked with enzymes to accelerate the CO2 capture and reduce the amount of energy needed but even in our best case scenario it would still require about 30% of the power plant's energy output.\n\nThen the question is what are you going to do with the CO2? Sure you can use it for enhanced oil recovery or pump it into abandoned oil wells, but that really only works in Texas. Pumping CO2 from, say, Nebraska to Texas is energy intensive. One big earthquake could release all that CO2 and cause massive deaths (it's happened before, see Lake Nyos disaster). You can pump it to the bottom of the ocean where the weight of the water above will keep CO2 in a liquid state and at the bottom, but again that takes significant energy (bottom of the ocean is ~ 15,000 psi). CO2, energy wise, is bottom of the barrel (it's fully oxidized), so there's not many uses for it at the scale we're talking about. Remember, the scale of CO2 capture is HUGE.\n\nCapturing CO2 from the air is just a stupid idea. As you said the concentration is so low in the atmosphere that the driving force is almost zero. The flux (transfer) of CO2 from the air to the liquid capture solvent is proportional to the driving force, this means it would require huge capture towers to make any difference, and these take massive amounts of energy to run and significant capex to build. The MIT thing may work in the lab and will make a good paper, but is not scalable. You can't override the laws of physics and chemistry, no matter how good you are. The only way anything meaningful will work is to capture it at the point of generation, i.e. coal (or natural gas) fired power plants (there's over 350 in the US and probably 5 times that in the rest of the world).\n\nTo sum it up, there is nothing technically difficult about capturing CO2. The problem is you have to essentially build an extra power plant for each existing one just to provide the energy for CO2 capture and compression, which means you have to burn twice the amount of coal you're burning now. And then you have to figure out what you're going to do with it. Just doesn't make a lot of sense. Reduction (population control?) and renewables make more sense.\n\n(FYI, I have a B.S. in chemical engineering and a Ph.D. in Biochemical Engineering)", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "sjn 72", "channel": "UCiY73-JjUqDo9yRlHjojkig", "votes": "288", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTyukIn7Ay43gEoX-rVRTA78F5k3VF9QEe1XMhHGA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

We can run carbon capture at off-peak hours, when power stations would otherwise be idle, and do some very real mitigation of the climate catastrophe.\n\nBoth of these use cases require us to go all in on sustainable energy first, and build out whatever carbon capture infrastructure is appropriate second.

Carbon capture is being implemented (at least in the UK) under government grants, I believe they are targeting an investment of about £100 per metric ton so that wouldn’t really play into it there.

You just cant defy the laws of thermodynamics. ^^\nThe population growth problem you're mentioning is already \"solved\", it called development. ;-)\nThe higher the living standard of a given population goes, the lower it's fertility rate will go by time, basically going negative. Thats the reason why population growth is already in decline and its estimated that population peaks around just under 11 billion in 2050. After 2050 it will sink again, the first time substancial since humans exist, creating new problems xD\nIn 2050 the only continent on planet which still wil lhave some population growth is africa, making their labors in future very important for the world haha", "time": "11 months ago", "author": "Tamiasciurus", "channel": "UCnEdxp1jaDW4r0CGwD-PAuw", "votes": "5", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/pmLvAeJS_zuEvP-o8BUPJuqAvsa-OrVBf7eVvxvQ0BiSFdApYs4sW1mCZ1Sd8Uf6B4Hwv6-K4g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
{"cid": "Ugxd7GdRqP9XvF8Bl9d4AaABAg.9BRm-Q0nVU79ERVh-daF-G", "text": " @AKA SGSVirgil  Yes you're not a scientist, nor you have any idea of science or nature, which is basically ok. But please don't be so arrogant to think the scientists does not think or know about the stuff they are saying while you know so little yourself.\nFirst i want to critisise the bascic thinking behind your questions. THE EARTHS NATURE DOES NOT NEED MANKIND TO SUBSTAIN! We should think about the planet like we were some kind of guest. \n\nTo come to speak about your questions regarding CO2 cycle. There are a lot of so called CO2 Sinks and Sources in Nature. The Sinks consume some CO2 burying it into ground and thus removing it from atmosphere. Shells for example. The Sources give CO2 to the atmosphere. Mostly geoloical processes like volcanos or erosion. The Sinks and sources pretty much balance each other out over thousands to millions of years, making concentration shifts very very slow. The CO2 in the air mainly is cycled around though all liveforms. Plants consume sunenergy and CO2 from the air to create the sugar (C6H12O6) etc they are living from. If another liveform (or the plant itself) the consumes this sugar, the sugar will be 'burned' with oxygen into CO2 and H2O, which is the released into the air. \nYour body for example burns about 1kg of carbonhydrates and fat a day and releases 1,6kg CO2 via your lungs a day, which then can again be consumed by plants, and then you can eat the plants again. \n\nTo come to your questios regarding geological time periots. Yes earth cooled and heated often in the millions of years. Ths is a very slow process which is mainly driven by the average CO2 concentration over the times. The drving factors here are the CO2 Sinks and Sources. When the Sinks consume more CO2 then Sources produce, the CO2 concentrations sinks making earth cooler. If the sources are stonger than the sinks, CO2 concentrations rises making earth hotter. This processes are very dependent to the live on earth. The Sinks are mostly based on some organic activety. When now the sinks are strong they cool the earth down reducing their own activity. At a tipping point the sinks are getting so weak that the sources are bigger, thus again increasing the CO2 concentration, warming the climate, and again making the sinks stronger again. Constant and very very slow up and down. \n\nNow you could think, when CO2 rate is chaning since all the time, why do we care? The reason is not the change itself, the reason is how fast this change happens. Nature can adopt to it's climate enviroment, but this takes hundrets of thounsands of years. Currently we see a change that fast, it nerver happens bevor in the history of our planet, creating big dangers for a giant amount of nature, which we are dependet of. Think about youre self driving in a car. Not the Speed is important, but the change of speed. Driving 60m/h / 100km/h 33m/s is no problem. Breaking on the corse of 100m is also no Problem, since the changing rate is only 10km/h per 10 Meter which is fine. But crashing into a wall, making the change rate to 100km/h per 0m will kill you. Just to demonstrate that not the level, concentration or speed is the problem, but the chaning rate \n\nAnd now at last, why has CO2 an impact on the climate in the first place. We have to dig a bit into electromagnatic radiation for that. Probaly you know light is electromagnetic radiation. If radiation hits matter 3 things can happen. 1st. It can get absorbed, converting the energy of the radiation into atom vibrating. The rate a atom vibrates gives it's temperature, since this vibrating and temperature is basically the same. 2nd. It can be reflected, the radiation then just bounces away into another direction. 3th. It can be passed through, then the radiation just dont interfere with the matter, making this matter transparent for this radiation. \nI'll give you some examples. Your body my friend is for example are Case 1 and 2 for the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation called light. Thats why i could see you, the light refelcts back into my eye, and you can feel light on your skin. The lights energy gets partly absorbed creating the heat you can feel. \nNow example for X-Rays which are electromagnetic radiation as well. For them your body is almost transparent case 3 which is why you barly can see your body on a X-Ray Pic. Your bodys bones on the other hand are different, the radiation gets absorbed and relected, making them visible. \nI could now basically give endless examples. Important for you to know is that any material, gasses as well will absorb, reflect or passthrough some are of the electromagnetic radiaton spectrum. \nAnd now finally we are at why atmospheric CO2 heats the earth. Most heat is caused by the area of the electromagnetic radiation called infrared. This is just below the spectrum humans can see. CO2 absorbes this spectrum to almost 100%. I told you, absorbtion heats stuff. The CO2 molecules in air get hotter, and sharing their excess heat with the rest of the air. \nThe earth recives energy from the sun as light and other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. Stuff that got a lot of energy wants to get rid of this extra energy, often via the emitting of exact that infrared radiation. This energy normaly radiates then away into space. Partly it got absorbed by Clouds and CO2 which is dependnt from the concentration of both. \nAnd now finally we're at the problem. Mankind rises the concentration of CO2 in atmosphere, making it more opaque for infrared radiation, trapping that as heat in earths energy system. This is then compensated by the melting of polar ice which cooles the system as long as there is enough ice avaible. But as soon as there is not enough ice anymore the heat will acumulate very quick. \nJust like a glas of coke with icecubes inside. As long there is ice inside, it can sit in the sun and keeps cold pretty good, but when all ice is gone, it's not drinkable anymore very very quick. Probably you've experienced that your self. \nYou can also do a very easy experiment with that: \nGlass coke in the sun with ice. Note every minute the temperature in the glass. As long there is ice, the temperature will rise barly, but as soon there is no ice anymore, temperature will skyrocket.\nThis melting of polar ice is called a tipping point. Thats because ice reflects a lot of radiation recived from sun directly back into space. But if the ice is gone, the suns radiation hits liquid water, which does not relect but absorb almost 100% of that radiation, making it hotter, meltung more ice, exposing more water.... endless till there is no ice. \n\nHope that helped.

Anything that you think you need to force people to do with \"political will\" is wrong to begin with. I live in a country which is always threatened by socialism and you wouldn't last one month in here.\n\n2) no matter how much your \"political will\" destroys your own economy, China is not going to stop polluting the same planet you live in. All you get with your \"political will\" is becoming even more trapped in the \"political will\" of the CCP. They made billions with \"vaccines\" and \"ventilators\" from their own god damm virus. They were going to pull the same fast one in the world with that crap Paris agreement. Even after signing it they still kept building one new COAL plant every two weeks.\n\n3) the population of Nigeria is not going to stop growing and you can't force them to. Feminism will not destroy their families like it did to ours for at least the next 20 years, so you are just going to be demographically replaced in the world and not solve any of the environmental problems you pretend to be concerned with.\n\n4) climate fear mongers like you never talk about our main source of energy besides Earth's core: the sun. The sun has cycles of high and low activity and Earth's orbit also changes in cycles. For a large part of the 20th century, the planet received a low input of energy. The low temperatures and ice storms killed the crops in the South of my country and forced people to move to the center-west. Only recently it has recovered. Before that, in the 1700s (if I am not mistaken) a cycle of low activity caused one of the greatest famines in Europe. Just like CO2 itself, heat is great for FOOD PRODUCTION.\n\n5) the lobby against nuclear power and for solar and wind is just as bad as the lobby for oil. In fact, did you know that due to the unreliability of solar and wind you need to have a gas plant together with them? So it is literally the same lobby. Oil pays for solar and wind propaganda. Meanwhile we already have technology for consuming nuclear waste to generate more power and less dangerous nuclear waste and modular molten salt reactors which are inherently safe against meltdowns. But that never gets any attention because it doesn't allow to make bombs. India is one of the biggest countries in the world and is developing their own Thorium-based nuclear energy programs.\n\n6) we have had recent breakthroughs of supercritical CO2 turbines. This is huge and I see very little news about it. These turbines can recover energy from low temperature systems in just about every industry, and can improve the efficiency of any power plant.\n\n7) one of the biggest CO2 recycling systems of the biosphere is cyanobacteria. They use solar energy and sea water.

To name a few: it changes the chemistry of the ocean which has already killed off massive amounts of coral(an insane percentage actually) and without these corals it disrupts the food chain of the ocean.  Because smaller dish that need hiding places in coral reefs no longer have those so they die out.  And then the fish above them on the food chain no longer has food and the cycle continues.  Not to mention that whales, sharks, and dolphins are dying at an extremely fast rate because of humans so the food chain destruction cycle is happening at both ends of the spectrum.  But anyways, a huge amount of people on this earth require fish and seafood to survive.  These are the coastal populations.  So not only is CO2 in the atmosphere changing the chemistry in the ocean and killing off the fish these people need to eat.  It is raising sea levels due to melting the north and south poles.

The increase in CO2 is actually making the plant greener. Go check NASAs website for that fact.  CO2 is at 400ppm - let me explain that - 400 parts per million.  The maths on that is 0.04% of the atmosphere.  It’s a trace gas.  You say that fossil fuels are responsible for 3/4 of all greenhouse gases ?  This is factually incorrect. You should do your homework more often.  The largest greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is water vapour at 98%. Very poor Matt.  Your not doing so well right now.   Plants die below 180ppm of CO2.  We are actually in a carbon drought.   The explosion of life on this planet , the Cretaceous period , CO2 was at 5000ppm.   What exactly are the effects of climate change that are “becoming more obvious “ ?    Let me tell you this - you can’t answer that question.  Please do not say global warming.  Don’t embarrass yourself.  Just think about the medical and the Roman warming periods which were several degrees higher than the are today. Not to mention the the little ice age, which ended around 1850. Wait a minute ..... is that the date you scare mungers use as the start of global warming...!?!? Wow !

Friedrich Nietzsche \nTell us, Matt, how much did the oil cartel pay you to foster this foolish fiction?  Throughout your presentation you ASSUME that carbon dioxide is inherently harmful. Would you kindly explain HOW it is harmful? That will be a good trick, because carbon dioxide is inert, benign, beneficial, and ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE! Every cell in the body manufactures carbon dioxide, and the human body contains about 20 liters of carbon dioxide that is absorbed in fluids and tissues, as compared to one liter of oxygen and one liter of nitrogen. If the stuff were toxic, we would all be dead. CO2 is essential for oxygen oxygen capture from the atmosphere and transport to cells deep within the vertebrate body. It lowers capillary flow resistance, and promotes cardiac output and tissue perfusion. It has no more toxic effects than water. One can drown in carbon dioxide, just as one can drown in water, but it has no toxic effects on tissues. In short, all this noise about carbon dioxide is just that---NOISE. It stinks of ignorance and malicious mischief. It's expecially ridiculous when one considers that cancer, diabetes, hypertension, asthma,rheumatoid diseases, and chronic illnesses of all sorts were rare 100 years ago, are rising catastrophically in accord with toxic environmental pollution from automobile exhaust, chlorinated water, pesticides, herbicides, and toxic industrial wastes.

One way they do that is by only funding highly technical projects where the barrier to entry is so high that they are unlikely to get any competitors.  Another way is by owning key patents that make it very expensive for anyone else to compete with them without large amounts of research and development.  In a low tech market they do a lot of research in production and transportation techniques to reduce their costs so that no one can afford to do what they are doing with lower maintenance costs.  Think of injection molding, there is simply no cheaper way to manufacture many things than injecting plastic in a mold, that is why most of what we own contains plastic, not wood.  The closest they can come is die stamping, but that doesn't work for more complicated shapes.  If you could either make very cheap plastic out of wood or come up with a tree planting process that couldn't be duplicated by your competitor cheaper, then we would have a lot more trees.  With all the fires in California, make sure you plant these orchards somewhere that never gets very low humidity.

Yes when it dies it will rott away and release co2 again. But a forest as a whole is CO2 negative. CO2 will be stored in the roots, funghi, animals ... and the layers of fallen leaves eg. will not just rott away into CO2 again, but will actually build up soil and bind it that way too - like the initial oil / coal build up we use today.\n\n2 - We have enough land. I really don't want to start a vegan/vegetarian discussion, BUT 50% of useable land today is used for agriculture, of which ~80% are used directly for livestock or to feed such. We need to take this on. When everyone at least reduces we can free so much land for reforestation.\n\n3 - forests grow themselves. Not much to add, but yes we can help that by spreading seeds further, but there's allready tech - look at drones, seedbombs etc.\n\n4 - a tree does not have to be grown out until it stores CO2. A Tree (or generally speaking a plant) is made up of nearly 100% Carbon. Even while they are growing they are storing Carbon away from the atmosphere.\n\n5 - We can use water surfaces as well. Algae can decalcify water, grows rapidly and just needs a 'hook' to grow on. Over deep sea this can be achieved by floating constructions. When they've grown long enough, they can be cut down, sink to the bottom of the sea floor where the water pressure traps the CO2. There are also Tests with algae trapping CO2 on land (very successful - search eg for Paris), turning them into food, building materials etc, or best one: Algae which produce Oil which resembles Oil used for Transportation in any fashion (Car, Plain, Ship) - this by it self would provide net-zero-emission energy source fueled by sunlight without the need to replace current technologies / motors with electrical ones (It's not the car itself thats damaging to the environment, it's the fuel)\n\n6 - Reduce. I know it's not really part of the discussion, but when we discuss about the net-sums of how much equivalent of CO2 we have to store in trees for which time compared to capture the CO2-output of factories etc. - please don't forget, one of the easiest way to help the environment is to reduce the output of CO2 in the Beginning. I really believe that as a human / worldwide society we should prioritize what we need. And we really should make these most basic and necessary things as environmentally-friendly as possible. Home (earth) - food - shelter - energy - education - transportation - ... and then fill in by prio and possibility. Adjust the economy to this then, not the other way around. \n\nWe all don't need to work 40 hrs/week to buy things we don't need to keep a economy of unlimited growth running which is killing ourselves. The Planet and life in general here will survive - will we?\nAnd sustainability in simple terms means that we should be able to do something in the same kind of fashion for ... ever. A sustainable earth is possible when everyone lives a 1960's swiss lifestyle.\n\nPlease correct me where I'm wrong, fill in the blanks, add more ideas, we can only do this together :)", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "Evergreen", "channel": "UCmvcPKZZdj8LegJhX-B32eg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8QWPFPdzi4DxKeUpNevIGFDOSYvfiZF8U6g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If you can get it below about 900 meters, say 1km to be conservative you can keep it in a supercritical fluidy type state indefinitely just by the natural psi down there is within that range. Now sequestration is NOT the smoking gun solution, it's certainly pricey and you'd get best results by finding areas that are seismically stable but that don't present a challenge in boring down too much, which is why the North Sea is pretty promising.\n\nIm no economist, it may transpire that trying to decarbonise goods, services and energy is cheaper in the long run, but I'll bet that over the next 20-30 years that won't be able to happen fast enough and we'll use sequestration as a stop gap solution in part until we get there.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Sam Spencer", "channel": "UCz3xe2VT2y1kXUf4okMm2bA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSA7Cx0XsNIfz3X_y5UjRmxmcVRYSbVUD2CwFrN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I now have no hope left for our civilization to continue and am truly fearing our complete extinction in the not so distant future. \n At this point in time we have only one hope or chance to save ourselves from a terrible future. This would involve completely changing our way of life and goals in all countries in the world very very quickly. Here's some of the things I think we'd need:\n  1- Change the money system into a CO2 equivalent value system instead of gold, oil or governments as it's backing \n  2- Change all prices on every goods and services into CO2 equivalent prices (figuring out how much CO2 is released by the particular product's construction, manufacturing or growing technique.)  \n  3- Only allow 1 child per couple world wide for a few generations. (Mandatory sterilization after 1 child no exceptions with penalty of death by offenders so as to discourage some of the wealthier in our society to cheat)\n  4- Constructing on existing roads an electrified train service for essential travel and movement of goods.\n  5-Close all non essential manufacturing including planes, cars, trains, computers, TVs, you name it unless absolutely necessary for life close it down.( making it mandatory to repair anything which is made for as long as possible)\n  6-Having local areas as self-sustaining and governing as possible.\n   7-Educating all children in science, math, literature and our new philosophy so they may understand why these steps where necessary.\n  8-Refusing to trade with any nations which do not comply and actively trying to force them to comply.\n  9-Having one world body in charge of trade, CO2 counting for the currency which would be monitored by local governments.\n 10-Having few laws on personal behavior and more on environmental conduct and damage enforced by local governments.\n 11-Promoting fruit and vegetable gardening and volunteering.\n 12-Reducing the work week as to share the work load across the citizens.\n 13-Have a merit based higher education system for research and work on expanding our knowledge in Universities to push our scientific knowledge and have that knowledge freely available to the public and other institutions.\n 14-Have a basic amount of CO2 credits to all people with no one allowed to use more than they have.( This would allow some who chose to save theirs to trade them with others who need more.

The carbon from fossil fuels was happily locked up carbon taken out from the Carboniferous period until we put it back in the atmosphere. The ONLY way to stop its effects on climate is to put it back in the ground. Tree's can't do this unless you cut them down on an industrial scale, bury them and let new ones grow in their place and repeat the process. THis would effectively speed up the natural process.

I also had some contact with the Swiss company mentioned in this clip - Climeworks. So what about CCS? Well, it might just be the next bitcoin - depending on what regulators will do. \n\nFrom my work, I know that it is always the monetary issues that make one thing work and another won't. It, therefore, comes to no surprise that even the EU is rather slow in getting their act together when it comes to emissions and emission reduction. nZEB is just one example of how many member states slow down the application and water down the goals. In order to just get somewhere into the neighborhood of emissions reduction, we would need a similar emissions reduction as we got from the COVID 19 economical slow down - and this every year. \n\nSo, if we are not able to reduce emissions, we need to capture them. What is the alternative?? Geo-engineering?? That would be real scary stuff which we still do not even have the slightest hint of how that could work and what consequences that concept would have. It is then on the regulator to set prices for emissions as well as max. limits - if you go over the limits, you MUST capture. At the moment the cost per captured CO2 is about US $ 800 - to US $ 900 per ton. The market price is about US $ 200! So there is a big cap - a mandate would increase demand sharply and the market price and the true costs would get much closer. \n\nIt is of utmost importance to have a safe storage concept.

If the general environment is close to those levels, well then I guess it will be permanent.\n\nAs for food, we already have enough, it's just not well distributed. Also, they do produce more yield with higher CO2, as long as you can also increase the water supply they need. I don't think I need to link to the many problems we already have with water supplies in major growing areas, and how increasing that, or how changing the climate might shift where the water is and so destroy the abilility to realise increased yields.\n\nUnless that is you think all of our crops should be grown hydro? Good luck with that.\n\nAs for returning carbon to the atmosphere, yes it came from there, but it is also being added by other means. When those means add, and the natural cycle sequester, that's a long term sustainable cycle. When we take what has been sequestered over a hundred million years, and add it back over a couple hundred years (that's 6 orders of magnitude), that's what will lead to the problems that most scientists are warning of today.\n\nI can't read your LAWKI comment, youtube cuts it off, but needless to say the very definition of LAWKI is the current climate, not 200m years ago, not a million in the future.
