One Tuesday Night this past year on the Late Show, Stephen was his old self. He was promptly given the rest of the week off despite a fully booked week. They didn't even change the descriptions that Cable and Satellite show when you pull up the Channel Guide.\n...\nThe days of cheap, abundant, fossil fuel energy were squandered for two reasons: First for just profits . Second for profit GROWTH after Reagan Cut the Capital Gains Tax and it stayed below the Income Tax Rate ever since.  Energy abundance was squandered for profit instead of for long term planning.\n\nAs one of the Oil Insiders stated, Carbon-Man will be remembered as a brief Epoch.\n...\nA Virologist pointed out that \"even a virus will grow to the end of the Petri dish then all will die.  It describes exactly what humans are doing despite declaring themselves superior.\n\nThat brings me to Thorium Reactors which have not and never will exit the experimental stage without the extensive taxpayer subsidies that that industry has always relied upon. Such industries should never be for-profit industries (like they have become). The taxpayers assume all the risk while the private companies extract profit (that again, they want to grow).\n\nFor all their worship of nuclear power,  they ignore the nuclear reactor 93 million miles from and responsible for all life on Planet Earth, a.k.a. the Sun.\n\nYou ignored my point on Bill Gates getting wealthy by urging the unnecessary repetition of selling the same software repeatedly.  It was all only for profit growth with little long term benefits . One can easily appreciate and understand the point by examining the role of the Unix Operating System, a far more robust OS and one that our digitized societies rely upon in countless ways,  every day.\n\nWe must exercise the intelligence that we think we have and re-design our societies.

I would need to research more to cross reference your points specific to that issue, but definitely agree that ‚Äútaxpayers assume all risk while the private companies extract profit‚Äù ‚Äî unfortunately this has become a common dynamic in our society. Universities, for example, have huge endowments, while students pay tuition with taxpayer-backed financial aid, and if universities don‚Äôt deliver any value or bully graduate students, oh well.  As far as Colbert, that‚Äôs incredibly unfortunate and depressing. CBS must have granted him free reign to denigrate Trump every night - thankfully.

The coronavirus starts to cry and Trevor feels sorry for what he said to the coronavirus and says ‚Äú AHH, I FEEL BAD NOW‚Äù\n\nUnfortunately, this is not comedy. This is exactly how Trevor really feels about a Covid Virus that has Led to the following. \n\nHE FEELS BAD ABOUT OFFENDING CORONAVIRUS WITH THE BELOW ATROCITIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED TO ALL OF HUMANITY AND OUR FAMILIES\n\nA dramatic loss of human life worldwide. \n\nThe economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty.\n\nThe pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk.\n\nNearly half of the world‚Äôs 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods\n\nNo income means no food.\n\nBorder closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have disrupted domestic and international food supply chains in which we all suffer.\n\nPLEASE WAKE UP AMERICA People like this who have a voice to millions of people worldwide should not have the ability to continue to have a platform as the LATE SHOW to spew his one-sided agenda to the masses.\n\nTrevor. As well as many other public figures in similar positions need to be held accountable for their one sided globalist views based on their beliefs and not be so closed minded that there are others who believe differently and that‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs why we live in AMERICA and have law and a CONSTITUTION that our country was founded upon.\n\nFortunately for Trevor. Since he is such a beloved character for the globalist agenda his past exploits were quickly squashed by the globalist in which he works for within BIG MEDIA.\n\nNOTE:  A lot of people have not seen the real Trevor and have not forgot his past. Its funny that in such a CANCEL CULTURE we live in now he wasn‚Äôt cancelled long ago for his supposed offensive/hateful comments which were much more offensive than the majority of the unfortunate cancelled individuals of today. WHICH, by the way means anyone who speaks derogatory towards the left and their agenda who does not agree to their personal opinions. If you do. You are deemed a liar, conspiracy theorist, white supremacist or domestic terrorist.\n\n His show is supposed to be an Award-winning program that examines the day's biggest news stories in politics, pop culture, entertainment, sports and more. That description is the furthest from the truth. The show is simply about a puppet who is would be clinically deemed Self-Absorbed. Remember folks TREVOR SAYS YOU MUST TRUST SCIENCE. So, here is the clinical description of a Self-Absorbed person which is simply another term for a narcissistic personality.\n\n They are always on the defensive.\n\nThey do not see the world from another person‚Äôs eyes.\n\nAnyone who opposes his views. \n\nThey don‚Äôt see the big picture.\n\nA self-absorbed person thinks the world is just about them. \n\n They are imposing.\n\nThey always think they are superior to others.\n\nThey are so consumed by their own world and self-image \n\n They are extremely opinionated.\n\n They hide their insecurities behind a cloak of success.\n\n They devalue others.\n\nConstructive criticism is okay, but self-absorbed people always take criticism too far and use it as a weapon to allow them to devalue others.\n\n They can be arrogant.\n\nThis is because they feel they are so important and better than every other person. A self-absorbed person can often be egotistical.\n\n They hide who they are.\n\ncoming across as pretentious \n\n They are extremely selfish.\n\nThey think they are great and the world out there is wrong.\n\nThe previous is just one persons opinion as allowed for by the the Bill of Rights which are the first 10 Amendments to the Constitution. It spells out Americans' rights in relation to our government. It guarantees civil rights and liberties to the individual‚Äîlike freedom of speech, press, and religion.\n\nNOTE: These rights should not be compromised no matter left or right when given a platform to promote ones-self and their personal beliefs.

{"cid": "UgyjbU7-rX81CbYjtvl4AaABAg", "text": "Dear Mr. Gates,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in newly developed (renewable energy generation) transmission technology for the energy transition in the soil. Water and air transport (also airspace / helicopters / military vehicles / drones, etc.).\r\nIf you would like to know more, I will send a short information about the scientific background of the transmission development fundamentals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea (problem): If you want to produce more power on the output side, you have to introduce more drive power into the gearbox accordingly. This is a problem with increasing the output on the side. It should actually be possible with lower drive power, multiple output-side power increases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution: The problem is solved with the newly developed integral gear technology. You don't have to increase the drive power if you want to increase the output-side power. This creates a unique selling proposition on the market, as there is no applied technology of the same kind that transforms the inertia and resistance forces away. The driving forces are thus freed from load forces (functional prototype made / tried. It works!). The project and the\r\n\r\n\r\nAreas of application: This gear technology is used wherever you want to increase the energy yield by approx. 7.8 times. For example, from wind turbines to (special) means of transport (electric drive technologies). The drive power of all means of locomotion and transport will work for years with small batteries. The diesel hold of container ships is being expanded and diesel drives are being abolished. The charging stations for electric cars will be superfluous. Rail traffic will run without a power grid. Funding for the renewable energy product will be increased by 100% until 2026. And these gaps can be closed more quickly after or with the integral gearbox. For the project we have to want the transmission, depending on the different performance classes, to achieve 100% zero Co2 emissions, we have to continue researching the transmission for the application and further developing it for the applications. The gearbox and its products must be marketed immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion: The infrastructures, the world renewable energy generation technologies are being redesigned. And all the unprofitable contemporary technologies, productions and uses that are dependent on the German economy, the benefit of the environment with the newly developed integral gear technology will be restructured and they will disappear from the world market in a very short time! Integral gear technology will dominate the world energy market. The project is very, very, very big! It's a paradigm shift.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am looking for financial support (funding) from Breakthrough Energy or from Mr. Bill Gates. So that my new renewable energy generation technology must be implemented for the world and the energy industry. Thank you!\r\n\r\nEmail: I.Yoendem@gmx.de\r\n\r\nTechnology developer\r\nIlyas Yondem", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Nadire Yilmazer", "channel": "UCgaaywjQTG1KxObzdcir7YA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCk5vNVOVLNLV0Dmlop5C8auQeTLFUETWxsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Bill Gates, described here by NBC News : https://youtu.be/WnKQ4tzg7ow polluted Planet Earth with e-Waste but he \"wants to save the Earth now\". Ponder for a moment,  the Globalist who lectured others on the spread of Viruses.\n\nPerfectly good computers (there is very little difference from Windows 95 to Windows 10) litter Planet Earth while Bill Gates lied to people every Holiday shopping season with claims that his \"new\" Version of Windows was \"new, innovative....

Bill Gates had plenty of time and money to do the right thing but he never took responsibility for the depletion of Earth's Resources and the billions of computers discarded too soon. Even the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is simply a Tax Shelter that purchases influence.\n\n\"New\" Windows amd Windows Office were released almost yeaely with greT hype from Bill. Each \"new' version was purposely NOT backward compatible - so all that Bill had to do was convince a small number of people to \"upgrade\" and now, the documents they share could no longer be read unless you \"upgraded \" as well. Imagine the domino effect.  Billions upon Billions of perfectly good computers discarded  because they were not \"fast\" enough to run the \"new\" (purposely bloated) version of Windows and Windows Office.  Bill Gates got EXTREMELY Wealthy and he saved money when he didn't bother to improve Windows. Computer Makers also made serious coin.\n\nAnother problem are the precious, rare raw materials needed to make electronic components  - wasted long before their useful life was gone but HEY, Bill got rich! How come you're not rich and \"better\" like him?\n\nDesktop Computers.  They DON'T need to have always faster components unless the software running on it needs that. Except for gaming, there is really no demand from using a Desktop Computer, they sit there waiting for us to do something and we don't type any faster now than before.  Remember that Smartphones are now, finally, starting with the Galaxy S20, almost comparable to a laptop computer in processing speed and memory but their largest processing requirement remains to be the screen,  which is far smaller than a laptop or desktop screen.\n\nRemember as well that Windows Office was quickly ported to work on Smartphones when they first debuted. Odd?\n\nAt its core, each \"new\" Version of Windows had no upgrades, it is a Desktop Computer Operating System,  not very good at that and very, very poor at everything else (Server, Enterprise Server, Virtual Machine, etc. Microsoft tried and failed miserably to expand their Market Share into big-boy-now territory as well as the distributed product market). Microsoft had so much money from so much fraud, they were able to block companies that would have made a difference early). The damage from their pretend Windows C++ product used as leverage to purchase the real deal :  Borland C++ then proceed to (rename it and) make it for only Windows platforms was a BIG step backward for technological progress.  THAT Should have been the focus of the Anti-Trust lawsuit brought against Microsoft - a lawsuit dismissed by the way, when Dubya \"won\" that's right, in quotes : \"won\" the Presidency.\n\nBill Gates has done plenty of harm including using his Tax Shelter; The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for funding news media (PBS, BBC, Link TV) to not produce and air stories that might \"tarnish\", shall we say? their image.

It would need to get well above 2,000 ppm or so to even start causing problems for non-plant life. The pitiful 300 or 500 ppm predicted would not even come close the levels seen at the time of the dinosaurs during the Jurassic, Triassic and Cretaceous periods (a little over 2,000 ppm. ). \r\n\r\nThe world‚Äôs bread baskets (the areas that produce food) will most likely move more toward the poles. Possibly turning Northern Siberia and parts of Canada into the next big bread baskets instead of the frozen waste lands they are today.... So things will change, but it will take hundreds of years, more than enough time for populations to move and for food production and industry to adapt.  Again, this end of the world scenarios (desertification drought and famine) being promoted is nothing but propaganda used by globalists to push their agenda..... Why would a world with the climate like that found during the Jurassic, Triassic and Cretaceous periods be so bad? During this time the whole world became one gigantic green house producing not only ten times the food it does today but also the largest land animals and plants that have ever lived. And it did so for over a million years.\r\n\r\nCase in point‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Farmers who run greenhouses pump extra CO2 into their grow rooms to increase production. If it makes their plants produce more food what do you think will happen if all the plants of the entire world get the same treatment? \r\n\r\nWith more CO2 in the atmosphere plants grow better and produce more O2 and water vapor (AKA more rain ) and the % of N (nitrogen) in the air drops, the air gets thicker and we all (both plants and animals) breath better....\r\n\r\nP.S. How do you verify that your mathematical model of future climate change and its affects are correct? You simply compare it to a time in the past when CO2 levels really did reach the predicted levels‚Ä¶ And when did that happen? During the Jurassic, Triassic, and Cretaceous periods, a time of unparalleled plant and animal growth.\r\n\r\nThen follow up with this‚Ä¶.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2vvgXFmVKw&t=1s", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "GSpotter63", "channel": "UCKU7z1mUQ4xAUwdvwwZV-Cw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTQaHXkTESSTA7rX7UxJ-A2K3POBq7CXAzqSCnj=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzdImt3jeezypbQDHR4AaABAg", "text": "When you look at history, every community built around a perishing business or resource died. There never was any form of help for these communities, and there won¬¥t be any this time. All those 40+ year old oil field workers will drop into poverty. Nobody cares for retrained ex oil rig workers, who should hire them? They won¬¥t bew working on building power lines to meet the demand of electric cars. Btw: There will never be masses of electric cars, for one simple reason: Hydrogen. German scientists found a way to store hydrogen in a kind of gel. There is no pressure or extremely deep temperatures needed, and the energy density is 6 times higher as with high-pressure hydrogen. There are only slight adaptions needed to engines to burn hydrogen instead of gas, the only exhaust product is water vapor. There are no adaptions needed to the gas stations, no new power lines have to be built, all reasons why we will see the extremely expensive electric cars fail in the near future. Also, electric cars aren¬¥t any good for the environment as a whole. Sure they save a lot of emissions where they are driven, but when they are built or dismantled, especially the batteries, they make easily up for that. Hydrogen is the way better alternative which just has been unpractical until now because you would have needed a highly pressurized tank, and hydrogen tends to explode when it is mixed with air and comes in contact with an ignition source. Things that tend to happen in accidents. The gel is not explosive, not corrosive, and highly flame retardant. The hydrogen will be extracted from the gel in a chamber before getting injected into the engine, the empty oil, which can be used to store hydrogen again some ten thousand times, will then be stored in a second tank. At the gas station, you will have a gas pump nozzle that pumps the used oil out of the storage tank while at the same time filling enriched oil into your main tank. Very slight adaptations making an enormous difference.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Shato Nyruami", "channel": "UCPfvObHkButv7FjyHteWVBg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTUKPH4lju37-ApXMjJKwplS6C5ICaM_FUCLcPmRA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Because the molecules are so tiny, (pure hydrogen is the tiniest molecule possible) they osmose into everything and gradually corrode it, no matter what the containment material is.  It's so reactive that it's not found naturally, so it has to be processed just to be found, which itself requires a lot of energy input.  The fuel cells require expensive platinum.  Molecular hydrogen's also not as good an energy carrier as hydrocarbons like methane, which is one of the primary reasons we don't use it very much.\nHydrogen cars are basically electric cars with an onboard generator, so will have any of the downsides a purely electric car with a smaller battery could have, as well as the challenges of hydrogen use.  The vehicles are as clean in use as electric, but still have some of the processing challenges that oil does, including production plant explosions.  Windmills don't ever explode into fireballs.\nWind, water, and sun can be utilized by basic equipment a middle-school student can build and maintain at home.

Oil Companies \nIf you said \"A\" then read no further and stop replying (Oh and don't have children,  population growth is a key problem).\n\n‚ñ™ In the USA, the \"Power Block\" segment on Spike TV each weekend morning was (perhaps still is) 4 thirty minute television shows on boosting horsepower by modifying a car or truck. If it were really a DIY presentation,  they would spend more time on the details. Instead, it is to get people to crave horsepower.  The shows were sponsored, in addition to their advertisers, anonymously by oil companies.\n\n‚ñ™ Speaking of Hollywood,  Los Angeles, California was once the home of a very successful Rail Mass Transit system.  Perhaps one day, YouTube will once again have \"Heartbeat of America\" hosted by Robert Krulwich, available for viewing. In it, they show the documents that killed the Mass Transit system, they have pictures of how successful it had been. Standard Oil, Firestone and General Motors pooled a portion of their profits,  influenced the privatization of the Mass Transit system,  proceeded to deliberately mismanage it, then when it became unpopular the rails were removed and more roads were built. Considering the wait times in L.A. Traffic,  the big winner of the 3 was Standard Oil.   Presently,  there are videos that REMAIN on YouTube that claim that \"...the Los Angeles Mass Transit was 'not that good' and anyway, was never killed by 3 companies that would profit from it being killed...\". Apparently criticism of Oil Companies gets someone mad but videos that praise them are okay. \n\n‚ñ™ The \"New Deal\" migrated Americans from cheap labor for the wealthy to a strong Middle Class. When Reagan became President,  the Desktop Computer was making its debut. So, there was an Economic Boom but it was because every company in the country needed all of their documents, all of their data digitized.  So a great many people were needed to enter this data onto computers. When I grew up, I was the youngest child of a WW2 Combat Veteran and our family of 11 lived on one income with no taxpayer support. Sending your wife to work full or part time while the kids were at school was attractive for the extra income from a well paying data entry position. It didn't take long however before 2 income families became necessary in the USA just for a family of 4 to afford a Middle Class lifestyle. Since so many companies that profited from the Cold War gleefully shipped American Jobs AND American Technology To COMMUNIST China some Americans were forced to take jobs working for companies woth Billions but that only paid a the Federal Minimum Wage.  What is ironic (is \"unfair\" okay with you?) is that a dual income family would be paying income tax but the company?  \"60 Fortune 500 Companies Paid No Tax\" https://youtu.be/suxW2CcKyjk \n\n‚ñ™ Conclusion : Taking a closer look at Reaganomics, the hiring boom was thanks to a change in Technology (described above). Reagan's Tax Cuts were for corporations and the Wealth Class : \"Supply Side or 'Trickle Down' Economics\". Finally he cut the Federal Reserve Interest Rate to nearly zero which did 2 things. A. No more protection in an economic slump by using Interest Rate Cuts anymore.  They are low and have stayed there. They now fight economic downturns by printing more money.  B. The low cost of borrowing  drove up prices and that drive up the cost of living. Finally,  it was Reagan who launched the cutting of Tarrifs.  Moving jobs overseas became possible because protectionism was fading and borrowing to move jobs there was low-cost.\n\nDo not lecture me. I am well aware that the Human Race is speeding full tilt towards wiping itself off of the planet but unless we reverse the Reagan Tax Cuts on Capital Gains, Executives will continue to reward themselves by growing, GROWING profits Every. Single. Quarter.using any means necessary to boost the Stock Price, cash out and not be taxed at all, or at least FAR below the Income Tax Rate.

According to the climate change fear mongers the earth should have evolved into a fire ball already and we should all be ashes. That was oh what ....30 years ago. \n\nThere isn‚Äôt any connection with climate and a virus. \nTry Fauci in a video in 2018 stating as a fact that Trump will ... not maybe ... WILL see a pandemic during his term. \nFauci is just amazing isn‚Äôt he. \nNow in that video he stated it had to do with history. \nOh really, wow interesting right. \nFunny thing I am 56 and not one time in my life , not in school, my 31 year career at work, spending time with family, friends,  was there ever a mention of \n‚Äú oh hey you guys 1994 is coming up. You know history has it we are going to have a pandemic ‚Äú\n\nNor during that time has there ever been such BS talk about climate change because if it were true and  as serious as the day it is , that just all of the sudden that now it‚Äôs the  cause of a virus, that career scientist aren‚Äôt all over the news etc talking about it. \n\nFYI: Bill Gates is not a Dr of any kind of profession  in the medical field nor  with any kind of tenure in that field, to be involved  in anything having to do with the medical field like making statements like he did  and guess what he‚Äôs not only not a  Dr or medical professional he‚Äôs not a  Scientist either. He‚Äôs   not a degree holding Atmospheric , Emissions, , Weather or Climate expert either \n\nNever knew that so many people in the United States of America were lacking  so much in self-worth , in self-confidence and self respect with that they sit and listen to main stream media and a man who has no qualifications what so ever to be disgusting thing as important as vaccines and climate change.. News by  biased news casting  none the less. \n People just say things and nobody checks on him. I mean  their  are real cientist out there that have been doing these things for their  entire life . Where  are they ? If it‚Äôs so bad why isn‚Äôt it all over the news , why hasn‚Äôt it  been all over the news , why isnt every scientist talking about it. I‚Äôve been in the workforce for 31 years I have seen  my company go through massive changes and do tons of things that we change to help the Environment. \nAs all big companies are all doing.and have been and  so what they‚Äôre saying ? \nit‚Äôs not true what they are saying. Its just simply not true. People really need to wake up I‚Äôm sorry this is just absolutely ridiculous .You have a man here who has no professional Qualifications or Business, to be . Talking about climate change  or a vaccines. \nI don‚Äôt care how many books he‚Äôs read , we have people that are philosophers, professors, scientist that do have a business talking about those things. That actually have studied their entire lives and are still studying and he‚Äôll do research even after getting every highest degree and acknowledgment of their professional careers they could possibly get, that  should be talking about these things . So where are they? Sorry but common sense is a very good tool to use in your life and common sense tells me he‚Äôs making it seem and Biden is making it seem and Klaus Schwab , World economic forum. M, It seem like such a big deal but the people who are professional we‚Äôre not hearing anything from them so my common sense is calling bullshit. \nIt‚Äôs making it seemof thethat truly would know that why are we hearing from both people. if it was that bad why aren‚Äôt we  hearing from the best of the best. \nBecause they‚Äôre lying that‚Äôs why the virus and climate change are being used as a tool as a tool for a much bigger agenda and y‚Äôall can say what you want believe what you want think whatever you want I have five notebooks sitting in on my office desk that are pure research not listening to mainstream media not listening to Fox News not listening to tapes doing research real research everybody to try it sometime instead of sitting there and letting someone insults your intelligence by feeding you bullshit and you sit there and you don‚Äôt even check it out and not just researching   one person , from one type of search engine. Like don‚Äôt go to Google and research climate change because guess what is going to come up Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci and all the elites from the Davos from the world that that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna come up why because they‚Äôre all all the big corporations are in it together you need to go outside of the box and get real information from real people that are an inter-twined and biased OK if you want the truth and after that if you come up with a conclusion that you still believe somebody that has no qualifications whatsoever to be talking about what they‚Äôre talking about which is life changing events for every single person in America I mean I don‚Äôt I don‚Äôt think that any of you really realize what‚Äôs going Bon.  do research gather information on  different people even eight people nine people.

Newer versions of Windows (starting with Windows 95 because,  I worked alongside the Product Manager at NEC Technologies in Boxborough, MA at the time and he spotted the fraud immediately, he saw the demo, we shared an office) was PURPOSELY made to require more RAM, more storage and more processing power simply to give the illusion of progress. Windows was purposely made to NOT be backward compatible with previous versions.  That meant that if one person in your office \"upgraded\" then EVERYONE in that office had to upgrade as well - JUST TO read the documents.  Remember,  companies sent documents to each other electronically so guess what? THEY had to \"upgrade\" as well. Bill Gates defrauded the public but the real money maker, the real real coup de t√¢t was fooling just enough companies to create a domino effect.  \n\nMicrosoft Windows was for  DESKTOP Computers.  They DON'T need to be constantly \"upgraded\" unless the software running on it needs that (WE didn't get any faster). Except for gaming, there is really no demand from using a Desktop Computer. Gaming by the way, is mostly a demand on the graphics and they are  now; whole computers inside your computer, they're called Graphics Cards and yep, they run the Display. Smartphones are just now, FINALLY, starting with the Galaxy S20, almost comparable to a laptop computer in processing speed and memory but their largest processing requirement remains to be the screen,  which is far smaller than a laptop or desktop screen.\n\nIt's a great indication of Fraud by the way when the Windows and Excel programs that \"needed a faster computer\" worked just fine on Smartphones when they first came out...\n\nAt its core, each \"new\" Version of Windows had no upgrades, it is a Desktop Computer Operating System,  not very good at that and very, very poor at everything else (Server, Enterprise Server, Virtual Machine, etc. Microsoft tried and failed miserably to expand their Market Share into big-boy-now territory as well as the distributed product market).

China's Asset was cheap land for factories, laws that the corporations wanted, disposal policies that the corporations wanted and Most of all; Cheap Labor. \n\n(When Chinese Labor becomes too expensive,  the Jobs will move again,  perhaps to Vietnam as some already have or perhaps to the USA if the corporations are able to destroy our economy and our laws in time for Labor costs to be as low as China's were when jobs first moved there.)\n\nCheap Labor boosts profits and I am not going to bother explaining why profit growth matters so much to the 1%. Simpletons like you can barely grasp what I am writing now but you will certainly try to take credit later.\n\nEvery year, like clockwork and before the Holiday buying season,  your hero Bill, figgityfaggity Gates would stand in front of any and every camera proclaiming that \"this new version of Windows is the best ever, it's innovative, [blah, blah, blah, lies, lies, lies]...\" and people would fall for it, every year. Worst of all were the directors of IT at companies. But their hands were tied because as I said before; Windows was purposefully made to NOT be backward compatible if a company dealt with another company that had \"upgraded\" their computers to run the \"new\" Windows with the \"new\" Microsoft Office,  the other company had to \"upgrade\" as well -- just to read the stupid document.\n\nStop and sip your $5 coffee and think about that for a while before you keep reading Stenchleton.\n\nNow, as more processor, memory and other component manufacturers competed with each other, it drove down prices and that \"forced\" them to cut their costs - that meant moving jobs AND proprietary technology overseas to the cheaper labor because by the time a computer is manufacturered and ready for use, a great deal of labor was expended making it  - so when you hear someone fret about \"the emerging threat from China\", thank YOUR stank hero Bill Gates.\n\nAT&T, later Lucent Technologies owned the rights to Unix, a software Operating System open enough to be modified (under license) and supported by more than just Lucent - meaning Unix Computer makers had control of the software on the computers and could value-add features that made them unique to the Market they pursued. (Unix Computers are the backbone to the Internet from the Internet itself to banking,  commerce, etc. Bill Gates' company is the Puketard, the twerp that wanted to but does not belong - much like you want to belong¬†@Messiah Majid).\n\nBECAUSE Bill Gates was and still is and always will be a lying, greedy, miserable scumbag, the companies that made computers that ran Windows  could not make them unique, they competed with each other. Did that drive down prices? Yes but when people were purchasing new computers all the time. In the end, they LOST, tricked by your scumbag hero.\n\nNow, I have said this already,  here in this comment and before but so that simpletons like you can understand,  I will repeat it again.  The UNNECESSARY demand for new computers driven by the Lies that Bill Gates told about software that in fact, WAS NOT NEW forced companies to drive down costs to compete for market share and that drove companies to move labor to where costs were low: Overseas - \"Globalism\".\n\nSo while I did decide to edit the comment I cannot make it any simpler for the simpletons.  You're all just going to have to go back to watching that miserable show starring \"Sheldon\" - it has a laugh track for telling you when it is supposed to be funny and THAT is who you people are; obedient.\n.", "time": "6 months ago (edited)", "author": "Arc Anon Drum", "channel": "UCg-E9hsta5N2Gj26vvDKGBg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRTuE_M0Y3GP6g1jo2R7qsoWfean49xxHY_sw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the Roman Empire in the second century AD, and perhaps to the Greeks of the fifth-century BC. \nGlobalism is not a new concept. The world gained gunpowder, tea and silk from China because of early globalism.\nGlobal governments were just as interested in expanding trade to boost their GDP as the corporations, case in point,In 1979 the U.S. and China reestablished diplomatic relations and signed a bilateral trade agreement. This gave a start to a rapid growth of trade between the two nations. That could not exist if China had nothing to offer, which brings me to debunking your next lie, the fact that China had nothing to trade with except cheap labor and land.\n\nIn agriculture, major crops are rice, wheat and corn as well as barley, soybeans, tea, cotton and tobacco. China has become the world's leader in both fishing and aquaculture. Timber is another major resource. The country has become a world leader in production of pigs, chickens and eggs.\nChina has extensive deposits of coal, oil and natural gas. Besides these fossil fuels, China is a top producer of aluminum, magnesium, antimony, salt, talc, barite, cement, coal, fluorspar, gold, graphite, iron, steel, lead, mercury, molybdenum, phosphate rock, rare earths, tin, tungsten, bismuth and zinc. China exports antimony, barite, rare earths, fluorspar, graphite, indium and tungsten, and it leads the world in domestic mining of gold, zinc, lead, molybdenum, iron ore and coal. You called me a simpleton. Well, even a simpleton like me knows that these are major resources for manufacturing electronic components, something electronic companies needed as they competed with each other. Same goes for automotive companies and a plethora of other industries. Not only that, but Japan, China's largest trade partner, was one of the world's largest exporters of copper, iron, steel, essential to computing and manufacturing. China knew this and incentivized US companies  with cheap labor, and cheap cost of production. It was much bigger than cheap labor. The US knew this and China knew this. \n\nYou somehow manufactured this illusion that the competition between tech companies and unnecessary demand for new computers, as you put it, was solely to blame for manufacturing moving to China when it was just a tiny piece of the pie. And somehow even in your argument, you completely ignore the presence of Apple and IBM and their competition with Microsoft to innovate new computer software. You claim this conspiracy that Bill Gates somehow made IT companies shut up and adopt his software year after year, when if it was as homeostatic and unchanged as you say, they would simply move to Apple software.\nUnlike you, I did not attack your personal interests or your intelligence  in order to make my point. My music taste is in no way a reflection of my intelligence, something I don't expect you to understand.

You might think the @MessiMaji would have heard of them. You also might wonder why the @MessiMaji was \"unaware\" that the US State Department supported the Dutch Colonial Apartheid Rule of the country of South Africa because it was a nation rich with Tantalum - a necessary metal for Incandescent Lightbulbs that Phillips (a Dutch Company) and General Electric (a USA Company), needed.\n\nYou might wonder why the @MessiMaji was \"unaware\" that the Assassination of Patrice Lamumba of the Congo was organized by the US State Department and the CIA because the country of Congo is mineral rich. You might wonder why the @MessiMaji was \"unaware\" that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ruled and tortured political dissidents for 30 years,  supported by the USA - Why? The Suez Canal is \"Why\". The \"Arab Spring\" finally overthrew the dictator and the people elected Mohammed Morse but the USA wasn't happy about that so they deposed him and installed Al-Sisi, \"President\" going on 7 \"freedom\" years  now...\n\nOr how about when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton watched a cell phone video of Muammar Gaddafi being sodomized with a sword, which made her laugh and say; \"We came, we saw, he died\"...  \"WE\". Hillary admits that it was a USA operation.  Why? His newfound refusal to accept the Petrodollar. \n\nNow, China certainly has emerged as an influence on the Continent but the USA stepped in. China still has Oil Contracts with Sudan but after a \"Civil war\" there, Sudan no longer has any Oil. The Oil is in the brand new country of SOUTH Sudan - and they don't have NY Oil Contracts with Sudan.\n\nThose examples are just a taste. Regardless of which country the @MessiMaji is living in, I just covered a wide area of the African Continent yet the @MessiMaji is apparently \"unaware\" of these?  How very \"odd\".\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is sounding suspiciously like a CIA Front now that the @MessiMaji has filled us in on why he supports them. It ALSO means that, while Bill Gates pays no Taxes, YOUR Taxes help fund the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nI'm going to bet that the mouthy @MessiMaji has just talked himself out of a job but how about that?

To claim that we should listen to him (instead of the source) and he can keep his money. I say, Tax him. Use the money for non-profit solutions. A well informed public is collectively intelligent but again, THEY MUST BE WELL INFORMED.  The Press knew everything necessary to predict a Donald Trump Presidency. They didn't tell the public and here are just 2 reasons why: \n:\n‚ñ™ 1. If Hillary had become President, she (confirmed that she) would have re-Nominated Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court Seat which was left vacant by Mitch McConnell for more  than a year. For a full 2 years https://youtu.be/mtPgUrVPXeI  McConnell also held open almost 200 Federal Judge Seats.  McConnell was waiting for a Republican President - did Mitch know something that Voters didn't know? Neil Gorsuch  (\"Frozen Trucker Case\" -> https://youtu.be/7a_2HQmUibw ) was appointed instead. EVERY American should listen carefully to the warnings raised by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse at the Amy Coney Barrett Confirmation Hearings -> https://youtu.be/cjcXVKg43qY\n\n‚ñ™ 2. Trump's first legislation when he took office was a Tax Cut (and remember,  Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate) \"60 Fortune 500 Companies Paid No Tax\" -> https://youtu.be/suxW2CcKyjk \n\nTrump loved to complain (full stop) including claims that \"the media ignores me but that's okay\".  Well, Bernie Sanders Won 4 States on Super Tuesday 2016 but who was ignored?  https://www.huffpost.com/entry/all-three-networks-ignored-bernie-sanders-speech-tuesday-night-promising-trump-would-be-speaking-soon_n_56e8bad1e4b0860f99daec81\n\nDon't look to be led because people are flawed  (again https://youtu.be/WnKQ4tzg7ow ).

Vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, but as far as i know, we are not changing the amount of it in the atmosphere, and thus not making difference on that side.\nI absolutely need oxygene, and i'm really happy plants spent the last couple billion years filling up our atmosphere with it, and they ar proably happy (if such a thing is meaningful for a plant) to have more co¬≤, at least in the short term, as it does make their growth easier, but it's not a good thing for us, not because we are going to lack oxygen, there is plenty, and even if we cut all the trees down, it would take a long time to meaningfuly impact the supply, and they absolutely help fighting global warming by using sunlight to break co¬≤ particles and making oxygen out of it, but they do breath to, so they do consume oxygen, and their net output is relatively small, it takes decades for each tree to extract a few tons of carbon from the atmosphere, it's a far cry from what we need to offset our output, even if we were to fill the world with trees (which is not practical, and would destroy a lot of habitats), planting trees is not, in itself, a solution.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Gabriel Pettier", "channel": "UCMTo1UQsJ2NEpzrTmkbQgeQ", "votes": "10", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTUK0LYpxrLqN6suMw9bSdfwR2XdOzW5BdbtKeapQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is about how much CO2 from human civilization can change the temperature of the atmosphere and is CO2 the most important factor in warming the atmosphere? There are other factors, water vapor, dust, which cause more greenhouse effect.\nFor example, your house is heated with gas and emitting CO2. Were you taxed on CO2 and did not heat your house or are you sitting at home in a fur coat?\nThe climate on Earth depends more on other factors. It's just that you can't tax dust or water vapor, but you can tax CO2, that's all. Why are nuclear power plants being closed? They emit the least CO2, work without surges in electricity production, take up little space, electricity from them is the cheapest. Waste? So in Russia, this radioactive waste has already been processed 6 times and received again plutonium for power plants.\nAfter 6 processing, the level of radiation from waste is the same as that of natural granite. Windmills, solar panels, etc. is an expensive and dead-end development branch. Electricity from them is subsidized by the state, i.e. out of our pockets. When the subsidies end, the windmills and photovoltaic panels are removed, they become unprofitable. They are more expensive to operate than the cost of electricity without subsidies.\nThe climate on Earth is self-regulating. Excess CO2 isn't always a bad thing. The amount of chlorophyll in plants increases and they absorb more CO2.\nIf you think and panic like you, then if a couple of volcanoes on Earth become active, then we will all die out. Any development chain cannot be interrupted. It will be possible to switch from atomic energy with uranium and plutonium to thorium, and later to hydrogen and deuterium. The waste will no longer be so radioactive. And if nuclear power is stopped now, then there will be no more development of reactors and technologists in this direction. There will be no more wind on Earth, just as there will be no more sunny days.", "time": "6 months ago", "author": "Sergej Kuznecov", "channel": "UCgpb8Fj8WnghLLtBIXFuTVw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkextafW4ITjz1n2Wqet2Y0owcY9EEEc1Qwg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgzpRPBGOd4aTdIE90V4AaABAg.9JsQfalsIpL9JtbmKRKGRC", "text": "There are several organizations that are looking into this, in fact there is lab created meat in stores today. Some are taking the same idea that's used to create tissue medically & instead working towards making viable meat products that are real meat. This is tissue samples taken from an animal, but is non lethal and about as painful as going to a vet for the same thing. So animal cruelty by killing animals for meat could be eliminated. Also, it would help to reduce the amount of animals needed & create healthier, better cared for livestock.\n\nThe tissue samples are then used with stem cells to make more animal tissue. Stem cells become whatever they are added to, becoming tendons, meaty tissue or whatever. So in a way, that sample could help to make a very large amount of meat grown in a lab so it's sterilized. Most meat is contaminated in the slaughter house where animals are killed. This bypasses these conditions to make meat safer, healthier & more abundant without the costs of large numbers of animals.\n\nSome take a different approach and make a plant based variety of meat. By using various plants, they create a product that has the same texture, taste and visual look of real meat. Both of these would be a smart way to reduce the huge populations of livestock. It would also work with other animals like turkey, duck, deer, and other wild game animals. All without decimating the populations of these creatures.\n\nIf the quality is high enough for use in medical replacement surgeries, why would it not be just as viable to use this method to create a lab grown meat for consumption. Science has also made an amazing breakthrough - Fat cells can be used to make stem cells! It's easier and everyone has at least some fat on them somewhere. Which means, we could use our own fat to treat illnesses we have or damage that's been done by having stem cells made to fix the problem. From fat!\n\nThat means it would be easy to create stem cells, thus the creation of lab grown meat from tissue samples would be less costly & nearly unlimited. You only need a few cells to start and add the stem cells to... so that small sample could create hundreds if not thousands of pounds of meat - safe, healthy meat that tastes great!\nCheck out the stores to see if they are carrying lab meat or plant meat products. See if you can taste the difference... We use meat in stews, meatballs, stroganoff & any number of recipes. They've created beef & chicken, the two most popular. They are going to work on others, once these are doing well... It would be great to reduce the need for thousands of livestock animals to feed people. With how much waste there is in the states, it's sad how much ends up in the trash with how many people are going hungry. We can do a lot better than we are doing right now. This is something the human race is responsible for - time to do what we can to make changes. And to hold responsible those who refuse to do what's right by our planet & the future of our species - and all others.

I didn't say it was a good way, but we have changed. Not all of us can deal with going back to plants, our guts would take time to re-calibrate something like that. Plus there are far too many who won't want to change.\nSo as long as there are huge amounts of livestock making money for their owners - it's going to keep going on.\n\nAnd get this tidbit - those herds being grazed on public lands by BLM for pennies - most of that meat is for export, with a mere 10% for local sale. These herds are the ones ranchers can't feed at home cause they've another thousand head herd grazing there. These are their export herd to make more money while saving tons of it having them graze on public land. Now that specific land was set aside for the wild mustang & burros. Where are they? Shoved off to poor brush areas where there's little grass, or stuff that's not that good for them. The BLM has also warehoused dozens of herds in places they try to forbid the public despite it not being a private area. Rescuers have had to try to purchase these animals through auctions where the BLM is trying to sell the horses to slaughterhouses. This is disgraceful treatment of these historic animals that helped build this country in the early eras.\nWe need to reduce livestock for food, not only for the environment, but for the diversity of species. They are trying to \"get rid\" of mustangs, burros - as well as predators in the area due to ranchers complaining they need their meal tickets protected on public land - our land. The ones benefiting are BLM & ranchers.\n\nIt may be difficult, but we need to get meat eaters, I'm one myself. To be more open to not killing their meals. A rare turkey or chicken dinner, rabbit or pork... but the majority should be grown in a lab where it's not going to be contaminated. Eventually, we can shift to grown meat & plants... but we need to get those who are carnivores onboard the nonviolent, nonlethal meat production in a lab.

That Link you refused to click on is NBC News.  You can stop the video from playing if I lied - but unlike Bill Gates?  I didn't lie.\n\nFind me a video where Bill Gates has advocated for higher Taxes. You can't keep the Billionaires straight. Warren Buffet said that. Buffet is also a dirtbag.
