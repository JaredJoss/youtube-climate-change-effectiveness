Not to forget that a lot of fuel on the ground that makes the fires so destructive is managed incorrectly because of lunatic ideological nonsense from environmentalist parties such as the Greens. \nInteresting how the indigenous folks knew what to do: \n\n__\"Aboriginal people in the Kimberley have been undertaking traditional fire management for thousands of years. However, with the onset of colonisation and the removal of Aboriginal people from traditional lands, traditional burning was largely stopped during the twentieth century. This led to the emergence of large, uncontrolled wildfires, usually occurring late in the dry season and destroying important ecosystems and habitats. Often these late dry season wildfires impact grazing pasture, infrastructure and other assets.\n\nIn the last 25 years, with the introduction of native title and the recognition that western fire prevention methods have not been working effectively, we are now seeing a reinvigoration of traditional fire management in the Kimberley and all across northern Australia.\"__\n\nNeither the sun nor El Nino care what we do. \n\nIt's cost us trillions thus far to change nothing which is what the emminent scientist warned us about.

Both scientists agree on but when confronted with those the alarmists drop back on unqualified surveys rather than sitting how the climate and the greenhouse actually works. That's because it is very complex where only a very part involves CO2.  The increase in CO2 does not have a linear impact for example but much least because of how it works in the greenhouse process works. Water vapor and ocean interactions are the big players and are not well understood.\n\nIf you are a climate alarmist study the sciences and for god, sake don't trust AI-driven models as those have an awful history of correlation with cause and effect.

To a degree that makes sense, but in this case the potential risk is too great.\n\nLet's imagine there was only a 25% (1 in 4) chance that climate change could spiral out of control if humans don't change their ways, and 75% chance it's false propaganda. Merely a 25% chance of danger. Would that risk be worth ignoring? Isn't that enough risk to raise serious alarms?

{"cid": "UgycxarE-0P4IZDgF-N4AaABAg", "text": "Some underlying objective truths;\n1. People can live indefinitely in environments that range between roughly 40 degrees F and 95 degrees F (4 and 35 degrees C), ‚Äòif ‚Äô the latter temperature occurs at no more than 50 percent relative humidity. The maximum temperature pushes upward when it's less humid, because lower water content in the air makes it easier to sweat, and thus, keep cool (wet bulb temperatures).\n2. For plants, including the major crops (of which over 70% of total nutritional intake ¬†come from 3 crops), the limits are more finely balanced. Transpiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere. This is how nutrient uptake occurs and is essential for plant viability. Sustained periods at temperatures of 40C or higher where humidity is also high and/or evening do not cool sufficiently becomes non-viable\n3. As the atmospheric CO2 level increases above 400ppm, the nutritional content of most major crops start to decrease. As does human cognitive functions. We have now hit 410ppm.\n4. Atmospheric CO2 emits an increasing amount of infrared energy, 0.2 Watts per square meter per decade. Roughly, this means CO2 achieves maximum efficiency as a GHG, 10 years after initial emission.\n5. Water vapor in the troposhere accounts for the most GHG in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor increases by roughly 7% per 1 degree C of warming. Australia just reported 1 degree anomaly from 1910 - 2018 in their annual state of the climate report.\n6. In the first decade or so after its release, methane is 86x more potent than carbon dioxide, with an initial burst effect. It then decays into carbon dioxide (reacts with negatively charged Hydroxyl ions), where it persists for centuries.\n7. Nitrous Oxide, N2O is roughly 300x times more potent as a GHG than CO2 and is emitted via microbial release, primarily from use of fertilizers and dairy farming and other industrial activity.\n8. Sulphur hexafluoride, SF6 is widely used in the electrical industry to prevent short circuits (wind, solar and the like). It has the highest GHG potential of any known substance, 23,500x more potent than CO2. Being synthetic with no natural pathway for removal, it persists as a GHG for over 1000 years, yet 75% growth in emissions is predicted by 2030.\n9. More than 90% of the warming that has happened on Earth over the last 50 years or so has occurred in the oceans.\n10. The same amount of energy required to melt 1kg of ice at 0 degrees C to produce 1kg of water (phase transition), could be used to raise the temperature of that 1kg of water from 0 degrees C to 79.8 degrees C.\n11. Solar irradiation has been decreasing, as measured against the 11 year average, since around 1980. It will start to increase, although overall, it is of little net effect (whether considering Milankovitch or sun spot cycles).", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Alex Gullen", "channel": "UCdBbaEuuXa8HPX0fskUQuEA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRdxuCf8VbTWrkkHWs5qpMU65gJoQfoBFVzaJNjKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

By 1860 John Tyndall, an Irish physicist, had found that a key to this warming lay in an interesting property of some atmospheric gases, including carbon dioxide. They were transparent to visible light but absorbed infrared radiation, which meant they let sunlight in but impeded heat from getting out.\n\n\nIn 1895, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius discovered that humans could enhance the greenhouse effect by making carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.\n\n\nBy early 20th century, the GHG effect of CO2 from coal use was already established.

Yes, in a controlled experiment in a greenhouse, more CO2 gets you more plant growth. That part is correct. But that experiment doesn't reflect the real-world ripple effects of global increases in CO2, meaning those experiments are useless for guiding policy. So how do natural systems actually work? In the real world, increased CO2 is causing global warming which in turn causes the atmosphere to hold more water (7% more for every 1 degree C increase in temperature), which is leading to the drying out of some ecosystems--for example, across the American west. The combination of warming and drier soils than has allowed for things like the beetle infestations in the Rockies. The combination of these factors has led to staggering die offs of forests, for example, \r>800 million \"standing dead\" trees in Colorado alone. This increase in dead trees makes forest fires worse, releasing even more CO2 into the atmosphere, thus causing even more warming and an acceleration of this kind of destruction. The dried out ground also releases more CO2, and the whole cycle leads to epic storms, floods, and droughts. Meanwhile, the warming has already made crops such as grains to have 5-8% less of key nutrients, thus promoting poor human health, overeating, or both. More broadly, pumping most of that heat and EXCESS CO2 human pumped into the atmosphere was absorbed by the oceans, making them warmer and 30% more acidic. Marine life isn't designed for these rapid changes in their ecosystem, and the last time the Earth warmed this rapidly, >90% of life in the oceans went extinct. THAT is where our reckless disruption of ecosystem balance is taking us: For example, half of the largest living thing on Earth--the 2400 mile-long Great Barrier Reef--already died in two events related to global warming and ocean acidification.

Further, Allen failed to challenge Lindzen‚Äôs conclusion that recent warming was insignificant and would continue to be so, despite exponential growth in CO2 emissions.

Pole shift causing magnetic north pole to move towards Siberia = the cold waters of the Kara and East Siberian sea also moving into the Atlantic. As Siberia moves up to the new geographical northern point, the colder air of northern Siberia also moving towards the Atlantic. As North America moves south, the Jet stream is distorted by the cold water and air from the melting Arctic, the cold water from the Kara and East Siberian Sea as well as the northern tip of Siberia which has had -83 degrees recorded in winter 2017-18 and domestic and wild animals freezing to death, just as the many animals that froze to death in previous cold periods. \n\n\nAs the tip of Argentina/Chile and Siberia migrate to the poles, these areas have seen colder winters. The pole shift has altered ocean temperatures as snow/ice melt has released more cold water from the poles upsetting ocean currents and the north/south jet streams. Colder air over Siberia is being pulled towards Alaska, Canada and the northern states of America with the spin of the planet and as the ocean and air circulation patterns in the northern hemisphere of the Pacific are deflected. The increased land area of Siberia holds and accumulates lower temperatures, unlike oceans which benefit from the circulation of warmer waters from the equator. Sadly this process will generate more and more regional extreme weather not only in the northern continents but also worldwide. South Africa which is moving anti clockwise has seen increased droughts and floods over the past few years for the same reason....pole shift. \n\n\nThe pole shift has altered migration patterns of marine life, birds and animals. Then add the daily GPS correction of GPS locations of airports and add the fact that government and satellite industry colleagues have been told not to talk about pole shift. Then add the increase in skin cancers from the increase in UV levels in countries, particularly those nearer the equator like Australia as it approaches the equator. As the crust faces more and more stress, extinct volcanoes are erupting and earthquakes are increasing in number and intensity. Now more gases are escaping from fissures in deep ocean where the crust is thin, turning the oceans acidic and killing coral reefs. See Hundreds of vents leaking methane from the Atlantic sea floor.@  and Independant article @t  China is building ghost cities inland and at higher altitudes as well as in the west of China and in Africa, as ultimately eastern China will be in the Arctic.See China ghost cities @   Central an eastern Russia will also cross the Arctic and as the magnetic north pole moves inland, temperatures in Siberia will continue to fall, and the land surface will provide a suitable area for the increased cloud cover generated from the tropics, to fall and be stored on land, generating new massive glaciers and ice sheets. Many predict this will cause the world sea level to fall. More and more governments are building seed banks of every known plant, since during the last pole shift there was mass extinction of flora.

Simply drab and dreary, very general, fuzzy, no one dares to go beyond the few oil companies who reasonably argue against global warming. Nobody speaks about the partisans of the global warming, the car industry, with their electric cars, which pollute substantially more than the fuel cars, the nuclear plants, that want to come back after the Fukushima disaster, the Milankovic cycles, which tell us clearly what actually influences the climate of a planet with atmosphere, specifically of Earth, the fact that the outside temperature of a body is actually influenced by the temperature around it, its movements and speed of movement and the gravity force in relation with other bodies, and not by a mere part of its biosphere doing some temporary activities. Nobody speaks that even the clothes they are wearing for this debate are made of oil... No, beating around the bush with fizzy petulant wow, arguments...

My understanding is that everybody agrees that CO2 is increasing and that temperatures in the first decade of the new Millenium seem to be higher than those of say the 1970's. The thing is that this does not prove that man is the cause. I have seen some academic presentations that suggest that the contribution of human CO2 is miniscule compared to the natural component. Moreover others are suggesting that heating has also occurred on other planets. Other still are suggesting that CO2 follows rather than leads temperature rise whilst other present considerable discrepancy between the climate models and real measurements. Other still suggest a good correlation between sunspots and global temperatures, others bring chlorine into the equation rather than CO2. If any these latter studies are validated, then irrespective of scientific consensus, humanity is climbing the wrong tree.

It's amusing the narrator says skeptics are not scientists, then introduces a realist who IS a noted climate scientist.\n\n\nThe climate did warm.  Solar scientists state that it is now likely to cool and indeed there is some evidence that the predicted cooling may be beginning.\n\n\nThe impact of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been PROVEN to have been exaggerated - in fact the IPCC and noted climate alarmist \"scientists\" admitted that as the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide continued to increase the rate of surface warming decreased, despite claims that it MUST increase as atmospheric carbon dioxide increased.\n\n\nClaims humans are driving the measured increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide tend to be refuted by the fact that temperature rises first and as it does, this causes both the oceans and the areas of the higher latitudes that were formerly subjected to year round permafrost conditions to change from net carbon sinks to net carbon sources.  This has been scientifically PROVEN, it's not a myth, it's a PROVEN FACT.  The contributions from ocean and land as the Earth warms normally and naturally is much greater than any human carbon dioxide production.  This is why, when the Earth warms and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises, the warming starts FIRST and the carbon dioxide increase comes AFTER.\n\n\nMy own research indicates that climate alarmists have been saying we must reduce human carbon dioxide emissions since at least the 1980s.  They've had well over 20 major conferences where they insist that if we don't reduce human carbon dioxide emissions NOW it will be too late, but the result of each meeting has been to agree to let them increase but to attempt to tax them and instead of using the money collected to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions, it was actually going to be used in ways that would help \"developing countries\" to increase their carbon output.  China, the world's #1 human carbon dioxide source BY FAR,  was allowed to greatly increase their carbon output and they did so by going on a crash program to build coal fired power plants, the absolute worst type when it comes to carbon dioxide and other emissions.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Bob Roberts", "channel": "UCk3CZUuksiW8NM3ucu8ynOw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbTiCRFiTxZ-S_SxatDf5T7Z8TAepFBsOylVF6=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Here is another point of view:  Astronomers have been showing us pictures of the events happening on the other planets of our solar system.   Two things stand out;  the axial tilt of most planets have changed with respect to the sun, and very obvious weather changes have occured.   The only logical and reasonable explanation for this is the presence of an outside gravitational force strong enough to affect all of the planets of our solar system, including our Earth.   The axis of our Earth has also changed.   The sun's gravity is what keeps the planets in their proper orbits.   When an axial tilt occurs the northern hemisphere gets closer to the sun during summertime, and further away during the winter.   This causes a redistribution of our atmosphere and ocean currents.   This is what is causing climate change and sea level changes, not man-made greenhouse gasses.   The melting ice at the poles and Greenland are but the \"symptoms\" of  temperature changes from the sun.   I grew up in the Los Angeles area and remember that at mid-summer the sun was exactly overhead, but never shined through north-facing windows.   Now, it's two weeks to the longest day of the year and the sun shines easily through my north-facing windows.   That is functional proof that the tilt axis of our Earth has changed.   I'm sure that NASA knows all of this, but that would go against the global warming theory.

That should leave about 31.5% of the total light being white, to strike the Earth and be reradiated back into the atmosphere as Earth's black body 255k range of infrared photons.

One of CO2's properties is it has a reactive band in the 255K range where it absorbs and releases infrared photons in Earth's black body radiation range. Once released after absorption, there is one chance in 41,253 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate a body of water's surface, but will instead excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently, the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 46% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity.  The present increase in temperature due to this combination of additional  H2O and CO2 with over a doubling of CH4, in the atmosphere is approximately .9C at present.

Let's begin with BTUs out vs BTU in by the energy source. \r\nCorn 1.3 \r\nSolar PV 9 \r\nNatural gas 10\r\nWindmills 18\r\nLight Water Reactors 80\r\nCoal 80\r\nHydropower 100\r\nMolten Salt Reactor and Traveling Wave Reactor 2,000\r\n\r\nNow, consider deaths per terawatt.\r\nCoal 161\r\nOil 36\r\nBiomass 12\r\nPeat 12\r\nNatural gas 4\r\nSolar PV .44\r\nWindmills .15\r\nHydropower .10\r\nLight water reactors .04\r\nMolten Salt Reactor and Traveling Wave Reactor .003\r\n This does not include the one to two million people that die from cooking with carbon-based fuels annually.

We should easily be able to reach $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour. That brings the price of everything down substantially. Building small mass-produced modular breeder reactors would also make windmills and solar panels exceptionally cost-effective. Don't get me wrong, the initial investment will not be cost effective but will drop dramatically over time.  We could have the population producing the majority of their own energy leaving nuclear energy for industry.

If it had been allowed to go forward, we could have begun mass producing small modular breeder reactors by 1980. Installed in a grid formation like the internet, it would have been virtually impossible to shut the grid down. IThis type of design would also go hand in hand with solar panels and windmills. BTUs out vs BTUs in, the ratio of an LFTR is about 2,000 to 1. The best solar panels today are about 9 to 1. If you build breeder reactors first and then use the electricity to build solar panels, you would get a multiplier effect of about 2,000 X 9 = 18,000 to 1. Divide that by a coal-fired power plant of about 80 to 1, you get an efficiency increase of about 18,000 / 80 = 225 times than that over coal. If we had made the switch back in the 1980's our standard of living would be over double what it is today because the cost of manufactured goods would have dropped dramatically and there would have been a massive overabundance of fossil fuels available.   So, if this is all true, why haven't we done anything about it?  Two primary reasons, money is better invested elsewhere at this time and inertia. What we need another Manhattan Project if we wish to save our own butts and for the generations to come.

{"cid": "UgzxLVPxUdMrChNW8dt4AaABAg", "text": "Having studied two related subjects at university few years ago, and a lot of material since (for and against) on this topic including reading key IPCC reports I have made my mind. \nI do find it interesting to hear opposing view, and being aware that others may not have benefit of exposure to the relevant papers or time to study them, I feel I should put my 2 cents worth for the benefit of others.\nThe topic is fought on fairly low level and appears on the surface to be matter of opinion. \"Unfortunately\" nature of Physics and reality means that not every theory and opinion can win.\nWhat is needed is a way to convey dry numbers and observations into understandable information for the average member of the public. This is where some believe there is room for unqualified opinions.\nNormally, this is where references are called in, but in this case of broadspeaking spillage of byist opinions there are simpler ways to point to irregularities and mistakes.\n\nOverall after listening the debate I would say, this is a case of limited data misinterpreted by man of limited knowledge, for purpose of \"saving our money\" while coincidentally making some for himself.\nJust another attempt to describe current climate change as same as the ciclical changes in the past and obfuscate reality by unqualified statements. \nDo watch the debate and then come to the points below. \n\nIssues: \nThe amount of CO‚ÇÇÔ∏é emitted thus far has started but, did not yet produce the it's full potential, for example most of warming and change potential is accumulating in the oceans at the moment. \nThe process is long (50 to 100 years if I recall well, do check figures independantly yourselves) and thus message is that if we stopped carbon emissions we would still have that long period of temperatures raising and associated volotilities. \nThe fact that we still emit and in accelerated rate is just amplifying the speed toward \"runaway\" point where control and mitigation will be impossible.\n\n15:35 He clearly doubts the opinion poles of scientists and declares they were influenced but, does not provide reference to who was influenced and by whom. \nThis is pure speculation on the level of religeous dogma (we are expected to accept this as a fact without explanation) or conspiracy theory at best, and he clearly states seconds later that he has no explanation or basis for this opinion.\n\nStating that consensus is something to be scared and worried about, is silly at best. I find it reassuring and a sign that there is truth behind it.\n\n20:49 Another \"I do not know\", (about financing). Denying industry funding is dillusional at best, but ultimately has no bearing at the real truth of the situation. Pure diversion for no valid reason.\n\n25:19 \"I have a feeling\"....this man is not debating facts, he is diseminating his own fears around. Problem for psychiatrists, not meant to be disseminated but resolved privately with experts in the field.\n\n28:00 \"Save the planet\" is rdicolous, planet has and will do fine, it is the mammals (us and many other species) whose survival is threatened and at stake. An attempt of discrediting by exagurration.\n\n28:50 He declares that developed countries are not doing enough (speculative, how can a person stating there is no problem turn around and claim not enough is done about it?), they do not engage in mitigating issues significantly in meningful way...which is what? \nSaying that they should (self defeting argument) but partly due to his efforts and of efforts of people like him and big industry fail to act improperly? \nReally, major problem here is \"economy\"...high priests of neoliberal economic dogma have politicians mesmerised and in control, incapacitated and chassing carrot and funds instead of addressing real issues.\nThis would be funny if it was not tragic. He is using slowness of the process he is slowing down as proof that there is no need to act. Circular logic at best. Sad.\n\n29:40 \"This would only make us poorer\" is revealing true nature of his issue and motivation. \nNo, this will help us survive an put us hopefully on sustainable path. \nYes current industry will have to be modified, but \"economy' should stay far away from this. \nAfter all once we are gone...there will be no economy either. \nThere are: \nReal values- land minerals water, clean air etc. \nMoral values- rules for living in civilised, organised society and \nInvented/ficticious (agreed) values - money is ....nothing real, yet we put \"price\" on real values and destroy them, even judge if it is worth saving real values for the sake of \"economy\" and money? \nThis is as stupid as one can get. Magnitudes of order more stupid than supposed exchange of Manhattan by Indians for some shiny necklesses. \nYet we are presented with these examples seriously on daily basis today.\nAre we supposed to be that stupid? \nAre we really that stupid? I noticed no one laughed when he said these things, perhaps we are....\n\n30:00 he (meteorologist) states that cost figures by expert economist are ludicrous. Put aside that as I stated before economists should sit this one out. \nConsensus seems to be that average person is uncapable of understanding the magnitude of the issues unless represented in monetary terms. (Silly)\nBoth points aside...this seems to be unqualified statement of self grandeour as he does not explain error of others, just declares that his opinin is the one that matters (Worthy of Trump and a thump on the head).\n\n31:00 Proposal to wait and not do anything is a sentence for most and most irresponsible. Mathematics of early, delayed and late action is clearly calculated in IPCC documents.(Unqualified call to irresponsible stupidity)\n\n32:40 Again he claims it is ineffectivness of solutions (speculative, not qualified, not referenced and documented) is a reason not to attempt any mitigation. \n(I am aware that every cheap solution is being put first, and I am ashamed for it, but to propose not to do anything, that is way worse... really it should probably be criminalized. \nRecently I heard a term: \"promoting self harm\" being abused someplace and legally prosecuted. This is perhaps a place where it should be used.\nThis man is not only proposing self harm but also harm to others on mass scale.)\n\n35:00 \"Alarmists (call for climate action) case is based on models only\" False, models are used for future development prognosis. Explained sufficiently, read relevant papers. (False statement attempting to discredit someone else's hard work without explanation)\n\n38:50 \"How many people are involved\" He, (a minority), claims there is not enough people (just a few) involved in oposite camp (majority). (Just laughable) \nHimself, this man does not pose much danger, unfortunately there are those placed well in media (Bolton comes to mind), who will use  him to disseminate lies, portray false picture and promote wholesale destruction of resources.\n\n45:30 He is arguing human impact on climate variability. Given that for example, there is clear undeniable proof of carbon emissions by human activities and clear undeniable understanding what CO‚ÇÇÔ∏é does in the atmosphere, land and in the oceans, what possible avenue for denial does he have. \nJust stating dibelief does nothing. Basically what he is saying is \"1+1=0\" this, if nothing else is sufficient reason to dismiss his words.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you think I have misinterpreted something.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "IDraganM", "channel": "UCBZGGiDoPTTb9pCiGTQ0ejg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSR-rV7cujxf0zBrs_G_an45b-qYwf84WF1sg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As usual, the interviewer stands on demonstrably biased 'so-called' authorities but offers no evidence whatsoever. Also, this claim of 99% consensus breaks down for three reasons. One, it's 97% not 99. Two, a very bad argument since the 99% believed the world was flat. 3, it's false and based on a study performed by such a biased hack that when investigated the result was found not to be 97%, but less than 2%. Less than 2% explicitly said humans were responsible!!!  Let that sink in. And, of the 2%, nobody made claims as to what that means... because it probably means nothing at all.

Richard Alley was the ice scientist that discovered 'abrupt' climate change which was a major discovery that revealed how climate can change in major way in as little as a decade. It's good to have 'Lindzen' to hear what he has to say but unfortunately I am quite sure he is wrong, in a major way. The real truth is very scary, frightening and most important, unstoppable! What Lindzen really gets out of order is his view that 'man' has lived through all kinds of difficulties and CC will be just one more challenge.......how wrong you are Lindzen, all of life on this planet is at risk, plant and animal and their tolerance is much less that man's ability to adapt.

{"cid": "UgybwtWcAkEp6LV78Ap4AaABAg", "text": "Summer is scorching hot and winter is freezing cold. If global warming is right, then winter should be getting milder and milder. Right? Yes indeed. But this is not what we experiencing nowadays. To be right, we should say global cooling. Of course, it doesn't mean summer will be cold. Not at all. Summer will be scorching hot. Maybe even hotter if continue more emission of CO2 into the atmosphere through burning of fossil fuels. Why global cooling instead? Actually this got to do with the dynamic of the universe. Our Solar System which is at the edge of Milky Way is moving away from the center of the universe outwardly. That means the Milky Way and most other galaxies are moving away from the center of the universe in parallel to the expansion of the universe. So, what that got to do with climate change? We realize that atoms on earth will improve their appetite for photons due to the effect of the expansion of the universe. What is the proof? During moonless night, a deserted area will fill with complete darkness because all atoms are hungry for photons due to the effect of the expansion of the universe. So, all atoms including CO2 molecules will increase their appetite for photons. During summer when sunlight is very intense, all atoms up their photons exchanging rates. This will make summer scorching hot. In the¬† contrary, during winter when sunlight is very mild, exchanging photons are not intense by all atoms and they improved¬†appetite for photons cause severe drop in mercury; therefore winter is freezing cold. What other proof that global cooling is true?When atoms improve their appetite for additional photons, they gradually become more and more massive. As their stockpile of stationary photons have been increased, they also strengthen their momentum. Therefore winds are getting strong and strong these days. Hurricanes can turn into super hurricanes in the not distant future. Stronger¬† winds can bulldoze rain clouds in snowballing them. This will result to erratic rainfalls all over the globe. Some places experience severe drought and some have century floods. So, global cooling is real! What should we do?The only sensible and cost-effective¬†way to moderate the severe impacts of global cooling is to plant more trees in order to¬†weather the severe pattern of weather that brought by global cooling. If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of new, interesting discoveries.

{"cid": "UgysB-GDUpTOoQhNVxF4AaABAg", "text": "To answer the encesant question of there being  a concensus? the answer is no. There is no concensus of scientists that the earth is in trouble. The Eath is not on fire nor will it be. The weather phenonemoms you see is a normal variation in weather. There are less hurcanes now that 20 years ago. One year many years ago there were 11 huricanes. the next  year 2 the next 3 the next 7 the next 5 the next 2. No pattern. There are however 10 year 50 year 100 year 200 year 1000 year 2000 year and 10000 year cycles. Which cycle are we in and are we on the upswing or the downswing? No one knows. But it is a cycle and there are maximums and minimums. No climate warming and so they changed it to climate change. No climate variation out of the ordinary so now what? What if we are at the peak of the warm period and are now in the downswing to cooling and we fool with the sky and cause it to get cooler in order to counter the global warming that never happened and cause a global cooling acceleration. And who do we decide what is the mean of the weather when we have only had satellites for 50 years and the really sensitive new satellites for 10 years. There isn't enough time and data to extrapolate and we don't even know if we are extrapolating correctly in the warm direction or the cool direction. Rediculous to blame America on Global warming and to tax Americans when China and India are doing all the polluting making stuf for America's shuttered and moved factories. WTF are you taxing America for? Tax India and China. 36 to 45 volcanoes going of every day always has been always will. They belch out methane every single day and it doesn't make a lick of difference. Even these volcanoes are a zit on the surface of the earth and are insignifigant. The ice is not melting it is expanding and the ice breaking off in the south pole is normal. It expands out from the land ot onto the ocean and the wave action eventually sheers the ice at the land ocean demarcation point. There are more Polar bears thatn ever not less. It's the biggest hoax in history just to get carbon taxes and enrich take away more money from th working people and enrich the corporations. The is no 97% concensus period end of story. It's all BS and they are playing you all for suckers. A radio host calling the shots. Really. Read the scientific reports and stop listening to these talking head shows. It's not hard to read scientific articles and get the jist of the measuringtechniques and data and effect this data has towards, change and how much change. The Solomon Islands are sinking. They did a documentary 20 years ago talking about it and now they redo the same documentary and title it How is Climate Change affecting the loss of these Islands. Suggesting the loss is because of Climate warming which is now known as Climate Change. The sea level rise is insignifigant but the sinking is very signifigant.  Whole Islands are now underwater after 20 years. Look at the Galapogos Islands.

Educated citizens of developed nations have decreased their natural birth rate, but then Marxists in their perpetual power grab, want to increase immigration from the undeveloped world...and these people continue to breed at a higher rate....which exposes the subversive motive of the left. \n- replace coal power with nuclear and renewables. Interestingly, it was the same fear mongering left who opposed nuclear power from the 70s onwards. \n- reduce animal consumption and increase plant based diets. \n- reduce transportation needs by producing more goods and services locally. If you looked the transportation needs of the Amish, they'd possibly be as low as 5% of their neighbors. \n\n- town planners should make all cities more bicycle and pedestrian friendly, and public transport safer....which is unlikely in the USA due to diversity of values and poor lifestyle choices by a significant number. \nThe USA has been brainwashed of what constitutes a stable, peaceful, and prosperous society. It isn't multiculturalism or multiracial (there's never been  successful examples).\nClimate disruption should be the least of concerns for the USA. The private business and education sectors are throwing billions at research into better energy storage tech. Having the govt throw more money would be no doubt wasted and go to second rate researchers or rorts for mates.  \n- the other great tech that will make a difference is nuclear fusion. but that also has the best brains in the world beavering away. There's only so many brains that understand this stuff, and throwing more tax dollars at the problem won't necessarily shorten the development of it. \nSo once again, if the left are so anxious about climate change, then let them go vegan, sell their cars, stop flying, and live in communities that grow most of their food. \nEither way, the USA only produces 15% of greenhouse gases, so the climate alarmist narrative is a crock.

The action at a distance by gravity waves is effecting the sun, which is manipulating earth's weather. Hidden technoplogies are also manipulating weather. Tech with hundreds of patent numbers, and not conspiracy theory. This UN Agenda 21 / 2030 is used as a main thrust to usher in globalization. The UN is the framework, claiming man and his carbon is responsible is not the truth. The UNIPCC is an insult to common sense, as revealed increasingly by the climate scientists themselves of main stream. Yet... the very tired old line of scientific communism persists. The lies persist. The false documents keep getting put forward, like the bullshit from Motorola about the GWEN system and cell phones. Even the University of East Anglia shows the lies. That's not even the tip of the iceberg. \n\n\nThe title itself, precludes one from discovering the answer. Nobody denies the climate is changing. It's the cause the masses are ignorant of, and the deliberate misdirection of globalist ideology is driving it. Even the terminology keeps changing to keep people off balance and obscure the truth. Do you recognize this as a main thrust of a demonic agenda?\n\n\nDo you know...\nThe patent numbers of the tech used to control weather? \nThe multiple applications of geoengineering?\nThe cause effecting space weather & the sun's output? \nThese things also happened with the Hebrew exodus? \nThe multinationals funding the steps to eco communism?\nThe many steps involved in UN Agenda 21 / 2030 ?\nHow this relates to underground transport & cities ?", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "david mccallum", "channel": "UCkY1VzfAaSEClB8oJPtLp8w", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRvXePnieKwRjb30oy3Jxro-wC3C-DZsygpFA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I made 4 seal-able glass containers and placed a thermometer in each one. I then removed all the air out of every container (vacuum). In the first container I added carbon dioxide. In the second container I added water vapor. In the third container I added nitrogen. In the forth container I added just air. \n\nOne would think that if CO2 was a major greenhouse gas the air inside the container holding the CO2 would have gotten warmer than the rest seeing how the concentration was about 98% CO2 in the container, not the 0.00041%  currently in the atmosphere. But the container with the CO2 was cooler than all the other containers. I didn't paint the bottom of the containers black like what had been done with other experiments because I did not want the black background to skew the results.

We humans have only been able to affect this particular one.

Climate Change isn't just limited to the Earth, It occurs on other planets in our solar system with thick atmospheres. That indicates the sun is a major player in climate change.

{"cid": "UgyH6YrevDBRbv49XEB4AaABAg", "text": "The MIT professor is by no means the only Scientist of high standing who is anti hysterical on Climate Change. Dr Soon and Dr Patrick Moore (Co founder of Green Peace) have higher profiles and are more photogenic than this professor. They explain and definitively trace Climate Change without the Hysteria. The responsibility for Climate Change rests with the Sun üåû Political intervention is clearly providing a bias, fuelling the hysteria of the general public, whilst creating new demand for alternative energy production. You reduce CO2 by consumption. Therefore, the objective must be to increase forestry, which consumes CO2. Historically, the planet called Earth has experienced more than 10 times the current CO2 levels in comparatively recent geological times.\nMethane is the real danger, which would increase the effects of Climate Change by a factor of 30 times greater that of the highest projected level of CO2, 200 years from now at the current estimated production rate. Examples of hypocrisy is exemplified with Germany currently building 30 new Coal Fired Power Stations, because they made a Political decision to remove nuclear power. Therefore, this demonstrates to China, India and the developing 3rd World the hypocrisy of our Carbon emission controls program and the Hysteria being created to justify the demand for them to change.\nThe Volcanic Activity around the World represents a far greater risk to Climate Change and Potentially Catastrophic loss of human life, dependant upon the level of emissions, which cannot yet be determined. What this program demonstrated to me was that the media having generated by its projection of the percentage of scientists supporting the Climate Change Hysteria argument, has distorted the Scientific Facts available for analysis, including accurate modelling, which can‚Äôt be based on a 40 or 100 year caption period.\nThe European Union by specifying the level of Volcanic Ash permitted in the atmosphere before aeroplanes would be grounded, due to safety concerns was accepted by everyone as a good thing. Then having to raise that acceptable level of ash by over 300% when the level would not conveniently drop back quickly enough through natural process. We know full well now that Greenhouse Gases and CO2 levels will continue to increase, especially in the 3rd Word. Therefore, CO2 capture and consumption must be increased by as much if not more than the current levels are increasing. Remember also that you exhale 4% CO2 from the air you breath and if it where not present in the atmosphere you wouldn‚Äôt be able to breath at all. Methane stored in the Earth is a far greater issue than CO2 production when it comes to Greenhouse Gases.\nA Greenhouse Blanket Ash and even of Volcanic Ash has been the major factor in Historical Climate Change. Now that is something to get Hysterical about either with Meteorites hitting the Earth or Super Volcanic Eruptions. Last point: at levels of below 150 parts per million (ppm) CO2 in the atmosphere, no life can exist on the Earth, nothing will grow, you will have nothing to eat and everything dies, including you! It‚Äôs around 400 ppm today, except in agricultural production units where they increase the levels of CO2 deliberately to around 800 ppm to accelerate growth and ultimate yield.\nCut out the Hysteria and apply some Common Sense.üôâüôàüôä", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Joseph Maxwell", "channel": "UCO-sK1-Ym1l_mUmC29auUqw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSHLTSWcksNR92DL0IxCLuqqI89HyIvdetAjE-M=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It is what it is and it's been confirmed in many different ways.\n\n\nFor the last 800,000 years the earth has been cycling from ice age to interglacial period, back and forth for dozens of times in that period.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause of the wobble and orbit of the earth around the sun in conjunction with the cycling of the sun through various active and inactive stages. \n\nThe wobble and orbit at cyclical points makes it so that much colder temps can reign supreme and pushes the world into an ice age as a result.  Man will never be able to control this aspect of the climate, we are destined to enter another ice age in about 10,000 years or so. \n\nDuring those 800,000 years, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere vacillated between 200 and 280 ppm.\nWhen the earth was deep in the throes of an ice age, the CO2 levels dropped into the 200 ppm range.  Why? \n\nBecause LESS of the land above sea level was available for animals and man to live on. Less animals on the planet means less CO2 being generated via respiration, and the CO2 levels drop. \n\nWhen the earth was in an interglacial period, much like where we find ourselves today, the CO2 levels increased and rose up into the 280 ppm range.  Why? \n\nBecause MORE of the land above sea level became available for animals and man to move into and live, population levels rose, and CO2 levels rose as a result. \n\nIn 1860, the CO2 levels on the earth were measured to be about 260 ppm.  THIS MAKES SENSE WHEN CONSIDERING THE PREVIOUS 800,000 YEARS OF CLIMATE HISTORY \n\nLast year, the CO2 levels on the earth were measured at a little over 410 ppm. \n\nWhat the heck changed? \n\nWhy are CO2 levels so much higher, 130 ppm higher than what history tells us they SHOULD be based on the history of the last 800,000 years?  We SHOULD be around 280 ppm, yet here we are at 410 and rising. \n\nThe answer is obvious.  The only thing that has changed between the historical levels of CO2 and what they are today is mankind's development of and use of cars and commercial vehicles, and mankind's development and use of coal powered electricity generating plants operating 24/7/365. \n\nNewtonian physics teaches us an important lesson, and that is this.  For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n\nYou can't increase the density of CO2 in the atmosphere, and expect for the climate to stay the same.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "Les Schorlemer", "channel": "UCfgnvY8bNlFUN2sXvhNehyg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgSz-br7sqlhhUWY9Tf2IS25LgInkou8a86g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Fine, i'll indulge you, let's be serious then.\n\nDid you know that increases in CO2 have a detrimental effect on plantlife biodeversity in nature?\n\nAs PPM concentrations increase,  plants require more water and sunlight to thrive. Since plants in nature compete with eachother for both water and sunlight by outgrowing eachother and taking up more space vertically and horizontally, the benefits of invreased CO2 would benefit some species and be detrimental to others. The loss of diversity may be disruptive to the biosphere in ways we don't fully understand yet.\n\n\nOfcourse we mostly care about crops, as nice as forests may be, its the food that we need more than preventing erosion or conserving wildlife habitats.\n\nAnd since crops are mostly artificial monocultures that dont need to compete with other plants, they'll be able to boom in mass and we'll have more food than ever right?\n\nLike in those pictures of people growing trees in greenhouses with differrent PPM's and holding signs in front of themselves on which the number for CO2 PPM grows in paralel to the tree behind them?\n\nOr maybe those graphs that show various harvest yields clearly growing as PPM increases? \n\nWelp, that's all very good and true, in isolation, where you can supply those plants with the additional water and nutrients and energy they need for additional CO2 to have effect.Anyone that's had an interest in home growing under controlled artificial day/night cycles via Lamps in order to control a plant's vegetative and reproductive states can tell you that intentionally increasing CO2 also must go hand in hand with proportional control of water, nutrient and light feeds as well as ph controll depending on the growth base.\n\nBut in mass agriculture, your bottleneck isnt CO2. It's usually water and stable weather. Even if you could keep up with feeding and watering your now faster growing crops, you'd use up more resources for that production, and in agricultural irrigation and fertilitation, scarce water and fertilizer prices follow supply and demand dynamics.\n\nSo no, I don't think we're saving the plants and life that depends on them by pumping out fossil fuel CO2 in the atmosphere at a ludicrously accelerated pace.\n\nThe whole notion that the biosphere will ultimately benefit from the abrupt changes we are making to the atmosphere is absurd.", "time": "2 years ago", "author": "Dimitar", "channel": "UChBDi1UD9l0qqJV6T3f14kQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSfkHkaHr9FNNIzVMON_5vHJnS3QHvgNuJC0ifR=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If it isn't then we continue polluting the earth and destroying forests and wild life habitat and the insects which we depend on to spread pollen because it doesn't matter. We are all gone by 2026 according to some scientists. If it is primarily man made then we maybe able to delay our extinction by a few years but that is very unlikely now because society can't change that fast. Vested interests won't allow it. We do have a choice in so far as how we can face death. If you believe in the Biblical Apocalypse then you are part of the reason the end is coming.

So if the sun activities such as the coronal mass ejection (CME) and the sunspots activities fluctuates how it is possible to believe that Earth climate and weather, the plants and other lives are not affected by the sun. The CME frequency of ejections depends on the phase of the solar cycle: from about one every fifth day near the solar minimum to 3.5 per day near the solar maximum.\n\nWhat is clear from the study of past climate is that many recipes of factors can influence climate: solar activity, oscillations in Earth‚Äôs orbit, Lunar modulation, greenhouse gases (95% H2O, 0.05% CO2), ice cover, vegetation on land (or the lack of it), the configuration of the continents, Ocean current change, heat/dust thrown up by asteroids, volcanoes or wind, the weathering of rocks, applied technologies,  planetary/gas giants alignment, stars alignment, galactic alignment, solar system travelling through different cosmic forces, across different elements, and so on.\n\nIf there are a few degrees of warming, all people need is fresh water to the dry region from the flooded region.

I call BS.  \nNano-Aluminum passes the blood/brain barrier and causes brain disfunction.

Look at all the large groves of trees that are suddenly dying without explanation. (well until they tested them and found high aluminum content that killed the trees)\nNow the most important question of all,  \"WHY DID MONSANTO DEVELOP A GENETICALLY MODIFIED GMO SEED THAT WILL GROW IN HIGH ALUMINUM SOILS..? \"  Can you say, \"Food Monopoly..?\"  That's right... all GMO's have a patent on them.. with patents the inventor (Monsanto) can charge any amount.  If GMO seeds are the only source of food on the planet, Monsanto will have a food monopoly.  You will either pay the ransom or starve to death.  The next big question, \"how involved / invested is Monsanto in geo-engineering projects around the world..?\"  Consumers control and influence the market place.. Only buy Organic produce and let the GMO produce rot on the shelf.  It only takes a couple weeks before a grocery store has to replace the rotting food.  Let your grocery store know that you only want to buy organic produce.  UPC code 9xxxx.    if the 5 digit code starts with an 8xxxx, it is GMO.  This is how the consumer can affect the market in real time.  Everything else will just fall into place and farmers will only buy organic seeds to produce organic food.

Most of the CO2 in the atmosphere is NOT caused by man-made emissions, however before climate change deniers cream their pants at this fact... most of the INCREASE in atmospheric CO2 IS caused by man-made emissions. So for instance, if you have 100 tons of CO2 repeatedly going in and out of a system, that is a balanced, carbon-neutral system. Carbon goes in, carbon comes out... So there is no increase in CO2. But if you repeatedly add 1 ton of surplus CO2 to that previously balanced, neutral, background cycle... even though you have only contributed <1% of the CO2, you are still 100% repsonsible for the total increase in CO2. Turning a previously carbon-neutral system into a carbon-positive system. The longer you do this, the more devastating the effects on the stability of the system.\n\nTHAT is the issue. There is no magical phenomenon that will magically remove the extra CO2 we've added. The current carbon cycle is a naturally stable system (hence why we evolved and flourished during a time of relative climate stability on the earth) but if we INTRODUCE unnecessary instability into the system that wasn't previously there, it's not going to magically stabilise itself. If we inadvertently add instability, we have to also add stability to counteract and fix it.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "ag", "channel": "UCXcgfWsQfAnXfcNuKJTeifA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSAsBiOgSwA-wukzPIngcWVYc1RZE-afN8hdbIC=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Even the theories of genetics established by Mendel were suppressed till it was rediscovered years after his death. \n\nTo be scientific, we need to recognize that the current theory of climate change is a \"hypothesis\" that needs to come up with testable predictions and conclusions. Otherwise, one can always say that skyscrapers in America are so tall that people in the top floor can soon start to have conversations with the astronauts and people on Ellis island may believe it. \n\nA problem with the alarmist movements is that it fails to recognize that the earth's CO2 concentration was much higher (over ten fold) in geological time, and both plants and animals were healthy. Toxic doses of CO2 are about 150 times the levels in the atmosphere. The total CO2 in the atmosphere is about 3E12 tonnes, and living organisms fix about 2.5E11 tonnes or 8% of the total atmospheric CO2 per year and this fixation goes up with temperature and CO2 concentration, and therefore the greenhouse effects of releasing CO2  should be tempered by vegetation. If anything I may argue that the solution is to plant grass on rooftops and all open spaces to increase the fixation. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a climate scientist, but am simply trying to grasp the facts and understand the reason for the international alarmist movement.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "kS1", "channel": "UCGE-lQEgO3Z6LzWejmE5X-g", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTvc2b8NKiuN9aYBlSzOagN--1y9RYiTpqrCw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Why does everything have to be considered on a planetary level? Clean energy sounds great to me even if the only thing it does is allow me to breath cleaner air in my own city, with no planetary consequences, good or bad. Maybe oil spillages have no impact on the global system but I definitely don't want to live in an area affected by one. And I don't get Lindzen's argument when people asked him what happens if he's wrong? He's basically saying it doesn't matter anyway because the measures we're taking to slow down climate change are merely \"symbolic\" and don't really produce any meaningful change. I actually agree with him and it's pretty obvious that whatever measures have been implemented so far clearly fall far short of what would be necessary to have any meaningful impact. But he might want to ask himself whether one of the reasons they are still symbolic and are likely to remain so, is because of people like him who encourage others to do nothing.

Maybe it would be best to take genetic samples from any species in threat of dying off now and in the distant future we could create moons or entire planets we manipulate to be a home for the clones made from these samples. Even if they were wiped out today, humans could in the future bring them back and give them worlds. Considering this may be possible in the future and life on this planet is ultimately doomed to extinction anyway why should we hinder the development of a civilization that could give what is alive today a chance to live on as long as the universe exists if we as humans manage to create a civilization capable of this. Why should we force over half the human population to continue to live in a 3rd world state by denying them energy, the energy that gives us all the modern comforts of today. 99% of everything that has ever lived on this planet is no longer here also, and humans had nothing to do with that.

The question of whether global climate change is real or not is a scientific question that has ripened to the point of concensus. It is the stage when after years of collecting data, reducing it, discussing the results and critically checking each other's work, all scientists come to an agreement. In the march of science, this is when scientists accept the fact as something they can rely on for further study. It is there with the fact that the Sun rises and sets because of the Earth's rotation. We don't need to collect and analyze any more data on that. It's established. We move on. Climate change is getting to the point where a lay person with internet access and eyes (or other ways for access) can also see that it's happening.\n\nThe climate scientists are no longer asking whether there is climate change or not. They are moving on to more questions, such as \"how fast is this happening\", \"what can we expect over the next 50 years\", \"what are the implications for the species on Earth\", \"what can we do at this junction in time to mitigate the damage\". They are pairing up with scientists from other fields and with policy makers to come up with practical solutions. And are being largely ignored, because our policy makers are still stuck on the question of whether climate change is happening or not. \n\nFrom my last interaction with climate scientists, I can tell you that the future is not rosy. We have reached the point where there is already too much CO2 in the atmosphere. That's a measured fact. We now need to not only really get on with cutting down on fossil fuel burning, but in addition, we must pump CO2 out of the atmosphere. There is an inertia there so even if we do these two things, the temperatures will continue to rise for a couple decades. Because we are already quite warm, we should also give very serious thought to short term emergency (but potentially dangerous and also expensive) measures such as putting up particles into the atmosphere to reduce incoming sunlight.\n\nIn parallel, there are things we can also do to the surface of the Earth to effect climate change, at the local and global level (things as simple as planting trees).\n\nWe are not doing any of that. And that's not just the US, with their heads firmly in the sand. Other nations have recognized for decades that this was happening and have been working on reducing their fossil fuel emissions, but they are not funding any research on pumping CO2 out of the atmosphere and other remediation.
