Now that's not a lot, but it does give us a lot of extra breathing room to figure out the rest.\n\nThe fourth step is a lot harder, but I think we can make it work:\nDecarbonizing the construction industry. This does seem a lot harder(considering just how much carbon is produced from the construction industry(while we can turn their gas vehicles into electric ones, we still need to release carbon to make cement and steel.) I think we can make it work, if we can make better machines that not only absorb carbon, but actually funnel it back into the system as something useful, like energy(without releasing it). This is a bit of a stretch but if we can get it to work, we can revolutionize every other industry. \n\nThis step alone would extract 31%, bringing our grand total of extracted co2 down to 74%(buying us a combined estimate of 70-90 extra years)(I am just gonna stop with estimates because im not a climatetologist and these time estimates are terrible.)  Certainly not \"Over\" by any standards, but at least we're managing it properly this time and the bulk of the work is done.\n\nStep 5: (14%) Remove emissions from the agricultural industry by going vegan or reducing meat consuption, or, alternatively, plant tons of algaes and natural biological co2 absorbers(hopefully mainly genetically altered ones) to cover for what isnt exactly as realistic as sort of a natural freebie. \n\nNow we have officially extracted 88% of our emissions from the atmosphere, we're almost there! \n\nStep 6: (6%)cooling and heating. With our electricity grid new and improved, it's safe to assume we can reduce our emissions there to near zero, heating is more of a problem; considering how many people prefer fireplaces and campfires, however; I think it might be easier to call on our good friend algae for this one :)\n\n\nNow we have officially extracted 94% of our emissions from the atmosphere, I think it's safe to say, that if we follow this plan, we can save the climate!

There were vineyards all over Great Britain in Roman Period. Siberia was four degrees warmer in the HCO than today, the permafrost was not so permanent. Please explain all that first before being alarmist about the current climate and weather. Everything is well within normal ranges. CO2 has been very low, and still is for a couple million years.

We don't control the climate. The activity of the sun has a huge affect. Also the relative position of the large planets in our solar system, that affects eaths orbit around the sun, which bring us closer or further from the sun. This is what causes the 100,000 year iceage cycles that have gone on for about 1.5 million years.

{"cid": "UgwBegvU-pJyiq3J2dB4AaABAg", "text": "I did this calculation once. Ok, first of all, NO. You aren't sequestering carbon from the atmosphere when a tree absorbs it, not permanently at any rate. Because when the tree dies, it decomposes and returns the carbon.... except even worse, SOME of it becomes METHANE when it decomposes, which is a form of carbon which is 100 times as effective as a greenhouse gas as the carbon dioxide that it originally took out of the air, so in the long term, actually it makes it worse. I think the best you can do is actually to grow a plant that puts the carbon compounds it produces into a solid form such as a grain or beans, which can be stored without decomposing. But as for the calculation, here's the deal. The human species uses 6*10^20 joules per year of energy. Meanwhile, 1% of the entire land area of planet Earth is dedicated to growing wheat. And the wheat harvested has a caloric value, or rather a joule value, of just over 10^19 joules. So there's still a factor of 60 difference between the energy stored in the crop yield of 1% of the land on Earth and the energy used by humans. Now not ALL of the energy used by humans is burning fossil fuels and puts CO2 into the air, but probably at least half of it does. So assuming that factor of a half, that would mean that to sequester the carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere by man by growing plants, you would have to dedicate 30% of the land area to growing wheat (or something equivalent, but wheat is probably about as efficient as it gets) and then not eat that wheat or do anything with it but just store it. Just so you know, that amounts to about 20 billion tons of wheat per year. Bottom line, you just can't do it with plants. They are not efficient enough solar collectors and converters of carbon dioxide to solid carbon compounds so as to sequester them.", "time": "1 month ago", "author": "medexamtoolsdotcom", "channel": "UCgVZ08z6dliD8foDtwk9zBA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSY6dCB7sYvyrTOvCjxej_gnteoV8RwePxgoWE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Trees need time to grow, and since climate change is already accelerating we have to plant now trees for an already changed climate: The trees in the Canadian forests e.g. have to struggle already with hotter summers than ever, and many of them will not survive. Dying trees release CO2, and young trees do not bind much CO2. We simply don't have the time to wait another 30 years when the trees planted today will start to have a real impact.\nWe have to cut down the trees which can't survive the climate change and to haul them out whilst they are good enough to be used as construction timber of for furniture (and so try to prevent the release of their CO2 for at least another 30 years or so). But their is another carbon sink in nature we could use: Bogs or moors. Humans have drained most of them already - only about 3% of the global land area are left. But they trap currently still twice as much carbon as all forests together do. They do grow only slowly, but the carbon stays trapped for thousands of years.\nSo we have not only to stop the draining and peat digging, but also start the rewetting of moors we can still rescue - and perhaps even build new ones.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Micha El", "channel": "UCLXDxtlUoTOTt_PAv6bRQmg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR8g2tnHXepCuBdGEJvws4Vf50CGO_zvCCNdklx=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugx8DS2C2W__ZbYm1Vh4AaABAg", "text": "WANT TO HELP SAVE THE PLANET?  Here are 6 things every individual can do to save the Earth:\n1.  Go VEGAN (food, clothes, accessories, toiletries, furniture etc.)\n2.  Consume products LESS and become an INFORMED consumer.  \n   -  Don't buy anything new (except if necessary, like medicine or contact lenses).  You can buy basically everything USED or make it yourself.  \n   -  Do your RESEARCH before buying anything.  Many products are destroying the environment via the extraction of raw materials, the production process, transportation etc.  Also production lines are full of human labor abuses.  Do your RESEARCH if you must buy something.  Remember, your purchase of a product acts to support that company and everything that went into that product.\n   - If you don't know 100% how a product was made at each and every step, then do NOT buy the product.  You could be unknowingly supporting the extinction of orangutans in Indonesia (ex. palm oil) or the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest (ex. beef).  No joke.  Stop buying products unless you are 100% informed.  Don't be selfish.  You  don't need most products.  Buy it used at eBay/Craigslist/Goodwill or make it yourself instead of contributing to the destruction of the planet.\n          - Check if the product has any certifications, such as:  RainforestAlliance, FairTrade, RSPO - Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, USDA Organic etc.\n   - Stop buying via Amazon!!!  It has rampant human rights abuses that have been clearly reported on many times, including abuses and neglect during COVID-19.  In addition, despite some of its 'climate pledges', Amazon has a terrible negative impact on the environment.  Think factories, energy-usages, packing for all of those boxes, carbon emissions for the trucks that deliver them etc.  If you buy via Amazon you are supporting human rights abuses and environmental degradation.  Do you really need that product?  Just buy it used or at least directly form the actual company.  Don't be selfish, be responsible.\n3.  Go plastic and packaging free.  Don't buy anything with non-compostable packaging, or that's made of non-environmental material.  If you do, make sure it's recyclable and recycle it properly.\n4.  ADOPT and REDUCE family sizes.  Humans have overpopulated the world and are destroying the environment as a result.  The human population is almost at 8 billion.  We need to intelligently and voluntarily work to get our numbers down to at least half of that.  It is a very personal issue, but please consider adopting children instead of creating new children.  If having biological children, consider smaller family sizes.  \n   - Donate money and/or volunteer at organizations that support women's rights and literacy.  On average, women's illiteracy rates are inverse to the number of children they have.  I.e. the number of children a woman has decreases as she becomes literate and more educated.  Here are some ideas:  Room to Read, World Literacy Foundation, Malala Fund, UNICEF, Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED), Afghan Institute of Learning, Invest in Girls, Educate Girls, AGE Africa, Asante Africa Foundation, She’s the First, Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE).\n5. VOTE and become politically informed.  Make sure to stay politically informed and pressure your local, state and national representatives to support issues and legislation that save and protect the environment and species.  VOTE during elections.\n6. Use only RENEWABLE energy and use LESS of it.  \n   - Buy carbon offsets from a reliable company for your yearly energy usage.\n   - Stop flying unless absolutely necessary (and buy carbon offsets if you do).  Walk, bike, ride a velomobile, use public transportation instead of gas-powered cars.\n   - See if your energy company has an option for you to buy green energy or support green energy initiatives.\n   - Install your own renewable energy sources, like solar panels.\n   - Be conscious throughout your day and use as little energy as possible.  Ex. instead of turning on the heat, just wear a few more layers and close the windows.\n\nWe can save the planet if everyone just does their part.  Everyone please act!\n\nCheck out this presentation for more information on human impacts on the environment and what you can do to help:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP83Qz6TabM", "time": "9 months ago", "author": "OneWorld22", "channel": "UCfImtdq6CFl50380Elm_JWQ", "votes": "3", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRoKjqlAUENtjQv-dK3Ll8625J9dn8IP1lcekWyjw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

There is no mathematical value in saying that the trees can capture up to 1/4 of human emissions. Totally incomplete. Says nothing about CO2 emission trends, tree life-cycle etc. One tree can  only take so much CO2 during its lifetime. What happens to that biomass eventually? Unless we store it somewhere (fossils), it is a zero sum game. How much oxygen draws entire Amazon out of the air? How many more Amazons do we need to plant to have any real impact (not just feeling good about ourselves or some questionable green awareness this will generate)?  Is there enough free and fertile land that can be used to plant N new Amazons? If not, how much is attainable? What is the real impact? There might be some answers to these obvious questions, but somehow the kids fascinated by these projects as well as the adults cheering them on don't seem to be even aware of the questions.

Forests can reduce Earth’s surface albedo, meaning that the planet reflects less incoming sunlight back into space, leading to warming. This effect is especially pronounced at higher latitudes and in mountainous or dry regions, where slower-growing coniferous trees with dark leaves cover light-coloured ground or snow that would otherwise reflect sunlight.

Since carbon dioxide accounts for 9% to 26% of the greenhouse effect and water vapor accounts for 66% to 85% of the greenhouse effect, we can stop the deadly global warming much more effectively by reducing the water vapor in the atmosphere. So here's the plan:\n\nWe get a bunch of plastic garbage bags and duct tape them together to form a layer over the Earth's oceans to stop the evaporating water from reaching the upper atmosphere. At the same time, we begin collecting as much rain water as possible and put it in sealed containers, stopping it from evaporating back into the atmosphere. Great! We've bought a ton of time! During this time, we switch from fossil fuels to nuclear to completely eliminate all CO2 emissions. We then peel the layer of garbage bags off the oceans and throw it in the garbage.\n\nWell boys, we did it.

{"cid": "UgwoLPQPl8Smvwgd9m14AaABAg", "text": "Says Fact and it's not a Fact. We experienced this amount of heating several times so it has been there before. For example: The heating from 1910 until 1940 was similar to the heating from 1975 till 2005. The cooling between is like the cooling we have now. We will be experiencing a warming again probably from 2035 till 2065. CO2 will rise exponentially and can not prevent the cooling. Trees were not the main cause for storaging away CO2. Because the stay at the surface they could be consumed by animals and fires and avoided to being stored away. Seashells and clams are stored in huge amounts of oil and carbonated rocks like limestone and chalk. They are the main reason we have so low CO2 levels. I am not saying planting trees is wrong, it's cool and all but since the earth is greening because of rising carbon levels in the atmosphere it's not necessary. Plants grow faster when there's more CO2 and they survive droughts better because less water can evaporate du to the reduction of stomata, little openings on the plant that lets CO2 in. The most effective way to get more plants is to increase CO2 because they grow faster, which is a common practice in commercial greenhouses. But climate change can't be defeated by that. What does that even mean? Climate change is not controlled by simple factors but several factors and CO2 is just a small greenhouse gas which is less effective in warming the planet the more there is, called the logarithmic effect. Water affects climate the most in all its forms. As ice it changes the albedo, as water it absorbs heat, as clouds it deflects heat. The wish to reduce atmospheric CO2 leads to extinction of all life because plants need a certain minimum amount to grow. If Crustaceans and Clams store more of it underground trees will die first and life after it. In the end clams can't build their shells anymore. Most people think they do the right thing but haven't researched this topic enough. Fun fact. There was a time where North Canada had subtropical climate. Today there are no trees. If we could warm up the climate enough we could plant trees as far as the poles. Tropical arctic was a thing. And don't worry about the polar bears. They don't need ice to survuve. They need seals. Seals don't need ice to survive, they need fish. Fish don't live in ice but in the ocean, and that exists almost everywhere. Another fun fact. When we had all 6 Billion trees we had climate much warmer than today, several times throughout human history. Why is everyone afraid of higher average temperatures? I would be afraid of lower temperatures. Because there is a rule: the colder it gets the drier it is, the warmer it gets the wetter it is. That means when the temperatures are higher plants can grow everywhere where there were deserts before. That is why the Sahara desert was once a huge savanna 8000 years ago. But in the end it looks like we will have another big ice age coming like in the last 400.000 years. We are in an interglacial period, do the warmest part of an ice age. And we already had the highest average temperature like 8000 years ago. Even that highest average temperature is lowering with every interglacial period. And during those ice ages there were kilometer thick ice sheets covering Europe and Canada. If that happens Billions of people will die because the earth becomes more inhabitable. And during those ice ages CO2 levels were at 180 ppm. 30ppm above the amount where plants start to die.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Stahlflower Animation 'n Art", "channel": "UC_cJNr-A7wmVAn_beaGHv-g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbElRRzuamwUqkQ1zsbpKr35xbBosDHJUksbkxmQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Fluctuations in temperature would cause fluctuations in humidity which would cause fluctuations in cloud cover which would cause fluctuations of solar energy hitting the Earth which would cause fluctuations in wind and fluctuations in ocean currents and fluctuations in precipitation and fluctuations in weathering of rocks and fluctuations in biomass as well as many other fluctuations.

Feedback itself is proven beyond a doubt. It is now researched how strong it will be (hence all the computer models)\nPositive feedback is actually the simplest topic in this whole debate.

If you cannot, you cannot argue feedback. And yes clouds increase albedo, and are one of the points still contested as far as I know. They also capture more energy which was reflected by the ground, and we do not know if increase in temperature will have any effects on cloud generation, or in which direction (more or less clouds) so there are a lot of unknowns in this area.\n\n\nI have never heard that CO2s effect weakens.

The level of CO2 in atmosphere was about 180 parts per million and now it's above 400 - almost triple that level. And according to you and many, many other people it's not just bad, it's almost catastrophic. But is it? I've read that the process of photosynthesis in plants stops when the level of CO2 drops below 150 parts per million and when it stops the plants starve to death. The life as we know it, on this planet, is plant based, so..... no plants - no life, no us. So basically in cold 1860 we all were on the brink of extinction (remember - 180 ppm), but that's okay, as long as climate then was a little cooler than now. And speaking of carbon, scientists determined that during last Ice age that lasted over 200,000 years there were some periods of time when levels of CO2 were over 700 parts per million (almost twice of what we have now).

Just a blanket statement like \"we should plant 1 million trees in every country\" doesn't take into account these issues.\n\nFor example, Chile has mountains in the east and desert in the west. They could plant the trees in the south, sure, but the number of people that would be needed to plant 1 million trees would do more harm than the trees could do good. Plus, there's a chance the Argentinian government mistakes the mission as a military threat.

If we cut trees down and bury them in hugelkultur beds, as they decompose the carbon gets locked up in the soil. High carbon content is basically what makes good top soil which would help us plant more trees. And if we built very tall hugelkultur beds you increase the surface area of the land which also means more trees. And if we plant trees that coppice well we can do this very fast because if you are familiar this is a process of cutting trees down to the ground in the winter and trees that take well to this will send new shoots up the following spring. This process actually makes trees live longer and can produce a ton of biomass very quickly as some trees can send up shoots that grow more than 6 feet in a year or two. Combining these two with reducing emissions and growing our food in a polyculture permaculture system also using these beds the way Sepp Holzer did actually would solve climate change without the need to engineer trees.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "justin grabert", "channel": "UCL-THCmzXC0vms7q3iLT4iw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSr2p6QqMuDgNcLLIvAxR6jsQxVp6KMp0a7wLTg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

And even if we were to use only fossil fuels for our electric cars, a few large power plants are always more efficient than millions or billions of small engines, because they can always run under perfect and preplanned conditions and not waste as much energy on heat and acceleration/deceleration on each stop light.\nBut even then, you completely ignore that fuel doesn't just magically pop into existence at gas stations. All the energy (most of it electricity for heating and machines) that has to be spent on pumping the crude oil out of the ground, transport it to the refinery either by ship or pipeline, then run it through all steps necessary to process and clean it (which uses a lot of cobalt and lithium btw) and then carry it halfway across the country by truck just to be pumped into a tank under the gas station.

[See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAvQ3t4ueZw]\nHowever, trees hold onto carbon only so long as they're alive: when they die, the decay process liberates that carbon back into the biosphere. So trees can only be a temporary solution, unless you create a large enough forest, and it's never cut down or allowed to burn, and it's ever replenished. (The Earth's peat bogs, because they also do that sequestration, actually hold more carbon right now that all the forests.)\nThe bigger problem, though, is that this works only on carbon dioxide. The looming release of mega amounts of methane from the melting tundra of Siberia, Alaska and Canada won't be reduced by either ocean biota or land-based plant-biomass.

I call it child abuse. \n\nI don't trust the black lady either. \"Women empowerment,\" -- there we go, steering away from environment into politics. The very thing the UN is so good at. \n\nTrees do not consume CO2 in the long run. In the short run they do, but then they decompose, and it all goes back. \n\nSure, a massive planting of trees will consume lots of CO2 for a while, but when the forests are grown, the old trees die as fast as new ones grow, so decrease in CO2 levels drops to 0. \n\nInstead of planting new trees, better protect old ones. I just saw a documentary on Borneo -- one of the oldest forests in the world, dying under the axes. With all the animals and plants in it. To be replaced by a tree farm. Great! \n\nIt seems that the real carbon sinks are not forests, but bogs. Peat moss, if maintained properly (which is not difficult), accumulates with no visible limit. But there isn't much noise about that. Perhaps because nobody really wants an inexpensive solution.\n\nBtw, has anyone looked at the graph at 5:40? China as a CO2 polluter is way ahead if everyone else. Almost twice the US (which is next). Yet no one mentions it. Why? Because politics.\n\nSynthetic biology -- sure, a wonderful pie-in-the-sky. Maybe millennia from now, after spending quintillion of dollars, people will eventually come with something. Probably not. \n\nWe have to stop producing CO2 in such numbers. Easy to say. The reality is: we will not. The core of the problem is not CO2. The core is that there are almost 8 billion people on the planet. The rest is consequences.\n\nSo far all I see is everyone begging for money. The UN, the reforestation people, the scientists working in synthetic biology, governments, women empowerment organizations, etc. OK, let's say they get all this money. Will it get better? Nobody cares. My prediction -- it won't. Governments will encourage destruction of habitats with one hand, while taking money \"for reforestation\" with another. \n\nOthers will continue with \"We have to provide children with some ideals, so they will be all rah-rah about the future. So we can manipulate them.\"\n\nNever mind that former rah-rah enthusiasts grow into \"I don't give a damn\" cynics after realizing how they have been used, again and again. There is a new sucker born every day. Literally.\n\nI just found out (don't know whether it's true or not) that hybrid cars emit more CO2 than regular ones. If this is false, then manufacturers of regular carsare  manipulating us. If it is true, manufacturers of hybrids did for a long time. Either way... \n\nNobody, except a tiny minuscule group of people, gives a damn. \n\nSic transit gloria mundi.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Kurtlane", "channel": "UCjH40UrB4qSIXmyv9bKkABA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQTMqVubQ88F-N9GHZ8KY12DkFRVWpyzMBd=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Re planting enough trees to make the Earth carbon neutral would mean not producing enough food for most people, leading to massive famine.\n\nIt's uncertain if planting the trees required would really fix the issue, since our current estimates assume things won't get worse. We've messed up our climate to such an extent that climate change has become self-fulfilling because of feedback loops. Humans have pushed the ball down the hill, and its gonna roll regardless of if we keep pushing it. The most planting an ass load of trees would do is slow down the deterioration of our climate and MAYBE in the VERY long term help reverse the damage.\n\nI don't mean to sound negative here, but selling a be-all and end-all solution to climate change is giving people the impression that climate change isn't an incredibly complex topic that cannot be approached from a single angle. Any solution to climate change will require changes not only from ourselves but from the systems we live under. There is no way to fight climate change without fundamentally changing our economic and social models away from consumerism and money-hungry expansionist corporation.\n\nWhile the aforementioned may make it seem that climate change is an insurmountably challenge, the truth is it's a lot easier once you accept that climate change requires such massive changes, because you become aware of how many allies you have: supporting labour rights activists, pushing for pro-ecology & pro-workers rights legislation, deplatforming climate \"skeptics\".\n\nThe sooner we accept politics and climate change are undeniably linked together, the sooner we can start fixing this mess.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Chosen Rubric", "channel": "UCey90HBC-v_sjUtKsDA542w", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTrnn-NycSWh8nLpnSLDMg52uxGryjr-Wd6pVCjKQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This goes for your worry that somehow a reactor will just magically give everyone cancer if it's running efficiently and safety precautions are in place. By the way, you realize fusion reactors would also have to abide by those same principles to be safe for human health as well, right? The output of fusion includes alpha and high-energy neutron emission, but if it is running as it should, just as with a nuclear fission reactor, the risk posed is negligible. \n\nHere's a series of sourced data sheets that disprove your preconceptions about the cost of nuclear energy vs its output. \nhttps://marketblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/variable.jpg\n\nhttps://www.world-nuclear.org/uploadedImages/org/info/Economic_Aspects/us-electricity-production-costs-95-12.png?n=4287\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/exports/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh_v1_850x600.svg\n\nhttps://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56a45d683b0be33df885def6/1528909327579-HWKW6IYAV0HWSL9HXNUD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kL3VKmwKI3leYB51VJjLFB8UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcgK5SGg9Ovb1yloBBOHcruw_mYLfAhRzzgArFCB07Dw0L8n4JypuoE5Tg6Wg5Oyvs/Material+Throughput.001.jpeg\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/styles/borealis_photo_gallery_large_respondmedium/public/2019/03/f61/Capacity%20Factors%20for%20Utility%20Scale%201200x630-01.png?itok=fJ8kQeNr\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/96/f5/3f96f5c96eb95f8ad081ad4d81315dd6.jpg\n\nNot only does nuclear energy clearly outpace all traditional forms of energy extraction from fossil fuels in every metric, it does the same against 'green' energy sources as well.\nHeres a fun fact, did you know that the production of solar energy panels is actually very harmful to the environment? The extraction of rare earth metals required to form the delicate pieces of technology that go into panels causes sweeping pollution and the destruction of natural habitats, as well as poor health for the workers exposed to it, typically in 3rd world countries in Africa that are already suffering through poverty and pollution.\nDid you also know that all that concrete they have to produce to support that solar infrastructure makes its own carbon emissions? That's right, concrete outgasses carbon dioxide as it ages. It actually makes up a lot of our emissions each year.

The electric car still is too expensive, relies on hydrocarbon fuels from the grid, & does a terrible job storing energy densely & quickly and lasting a long time without wearing out.

{"cid": "Ugw_bbXRC4VyzQJwdit4AaABAg", "text": "The video starts with a lie and labels it as fact. Regardless, the climate doesn't need to be saved. Nor does the planet. What we do need to do is stop polluting this planet. Because all that garbage ends up in our food at the end of the day. Now... allow me to share with you my findings:\n\n\n1. Our species went through multiple ice ages and global warmings. The current global warming started approximately 12,000 years ago. That's how the last ice age ended and the current geological period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won't last forever. Interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years. So, we have between 8,000 and 48,000 years until the next ice age.\n\n2. The rate at which the sea level is rising now is much lower compared to how it rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago – a period in which the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the Early Holocene Sea Level Rise if you want to learn more.\n\n3. The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the \"stability\" of the climate, you might want to look up:\n– The 8.2 Kiloyear Event\n– The Little Ice Age\n– The Year Without a Summer (1816)\n\n4. Chaos Theory tells us why the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum, for example – https://youtu.be/U39RMUzCjiU. No one can predict the climate.\n\n5. Computer simulations of chaotic systems have no predictive value because the initial conditions can never be measured with sufficient accuracy. Such simulations only generate pretty pictures on a screen. Again, no one can predict the behavior of chaotic systems. Because – Chaos Theory!\n\n6. Compared to water, CO₂ plays an insignificant role in the global greenhouse effect. Because – and I'm not making this up – 95% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor. \n\n7. CO₂ is not a pollutant. CO₂ is plant food. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis – a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO₂ and water. Without CO₂ plants die. Without plants, we die. CO₂ is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO₂ is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery. There are real pollutants out there we should be worried about and CO₂ is not one of them.\n\n8. Compared to astronomical factors like solar activity or the Milankovitch Cycles or terrestrial factors like volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We're not that significant.\n\n9. This may came as a shock to you, but we're actually in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation – the Quaternary Glaciation – look it up!\n\n10.  There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of anthropogenic climate change. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who essentially said Global Warming is pseudoscience – https://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0. Freeman Dyson said that \"Climate Change predictions are absurd\" – https://youtu.be/fmy0tXcNTPs Wikipedia has a List of scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming, but it only contains the names of those scientists \"who have their own Wikipedia article.\" Keep in mind that science doesn't work by consensus. Science isn't a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:\n\n“Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.”\n\n\nOther reasons that might make you think twice before you join this climate religion:\n– carbon capture\n– carbon credits\n– Al Gore", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", "channel": "UCtvj8-yqUr9qHpRZLXO5V1g", "votes": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1bOB9AnngP3Pl3u1PVE_lXsj_UmDBvRxF8InHKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As such, you can have ingrained subcouncious behaviors that you don't realize produce not okay behavior. You conciously can believe in equality in all forms, but subcounciously could still think of and are more comfortable thinking that a white man would be someone of great importance then someone else. It's something that you are exposed to from childhood that results in you creating an image of what \"normal\" is. A good example would be when people complain about having characters be of a certain race for \"no reason\". When someone makes that complaint, it is because in their mind, normal/ default is white, so anything deviating from that needs to have a reason, it can't just be that way because the world is filled with many different types of people, it needs a reason. It is also important to know why that idea may be seen as normal. Suburban populations tend to have a larger ratio of white to non white individuals. This stems from several factors such as bank redlining towards neighborhoods and individuals of color as well as social and wealth inequality that existed since the countries formation.

No, life is complicated and there is so much that influences every little thing. However trying to remove deleterious ideas that pervade our society is a worthy goal.  I dunno, in my mind, I would prefer to try and ensure that a reason for something is not the result of colonialism and it's legacy. As members of the scientific community, is it not our duty to try and remove unknown variables. Racism is irrational and becomes an irritating variable that we have to take into account because of the nature of our history and culture.

Everything is connected and influences each other and if you understood that aspect of the natural world of science itself, you would understand that culture and history affect people in profound ways. Why is it so much worse of an action to accuse someone of racism, then the possibility that people can be flawed individuals and products of the history and culture they come resulting in inherent bias or racism. It would be fantastic to live in a world where race isn't even thought of as it is a artificial categorization of people, however, we don't live in that world. We live in one where white european descendants have and to a large extent still do reserve more positions of power, wealth, and authority then people of color. If you sample people of various income and job backgrounds, you would expect to find that each income bracket or job would have a proportionally representative percentage of people from the demographics of the population, however that is not the case. People of color are more likely to fall into lower income brackets and that isnt accidental, it is the result of policies and preferential treatment by companies and government agencies whose ideologies dated back to segregation. The foundation for segregation and jim crow laws are inextricably linked to the ideology of the trans atlantic slave trade. Policies and laws and actions taken from a fundamentally illogical system because race is a bad way to categorize people because it is fundamentally artificial. You have to keep in mind punching up vs punching down in terms of power and affects on people. I have to ask you, is it possible that people can be products of their culture and upbringing, that they can have intentional or unintentional bias in their actions. I dont think anyone here is denying the accomplishments people have made or that these are people who are undeserving of what they have accomplished. All that is asked is to recognize that people can and often times are flawed, and that we should always look out into the world and celebrate wonder, celebrate things that bring us hope, that tickle that itch in your mind to learn more or to see what can be accomplished when people ask a question or put their mind to things.

Not just focus on CO2  emssions, which may have an bigger part in this process than I think, but noone seems to me to consider the cover of the earths surface with concrete and alike(mostly streets and buidings), the machines and technology that reaches ever higher temperatures in certain reactors and ovens, even the sun has acording to my information increased emissions (around 0,1% per year and this scince 1970).", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Karl II Kaiser", "channel": "UC-zOLNEnYqut_wnYUSEG-gQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ9EtBPsguoIwHnTY1AdZKHyV_Z_xas0w81F13U=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Burning wood that was going to end rotting is a carbon neutral way of getting energy (but generate other pollutants like solid particles in suspension so it need treatment). The way to reduce the amount of Carbon in the cycle is avoiding the rotting of trees. Naturally that occured when trees get sink/buried in ambients without oxigen. (Also back in the Carboniferous fungus had not yet evolved ways to rot cellulose that helped to form carbon).  Humans can turn wood into furniture and bulding materials that with the correct maintenance can store the carbon for hundred of years.  So if you grow trees in a sustentable way, replacing the ones that you cut/die with new ones and avoid the rotting you are eliminating CO2.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Angel Marin", "channel": "UClJ6jufmw1sELW6g7S8l24w", "votes": "12", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRRP5NTFfqZmMJUjH3JlMQwpyYM0aNyDpftEmd7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The elephant in the room that these so called \"science\" shows never mention is every facet of our Lives is based on fossil fuels and technology is derived from fossil fuels. It is the reason why we are a growing population (humanity as a whole) and it is the reason we are not all farmers today as was once common just a few hundred years ago,  The reality is the food we eat was predominantly fertilized with fossil fuels.  The clothes you wear are either made directly from fossil fuels or grown using fossil fuels. We heat our homes with fossil fuels through the cold winter months (and it is because of fossil fuels we haven't cut all our forests down ironically enough). We transport our goods that we all require or consume with fossil fuels. Our infrastructure is refined using fossil fuels. Even energy efficient things such as energy efficient insulation is made either made directly from fossil fuels or made from consuming fossil fuels.  The computers we are currently using are made from fossil fuels and materials that were harvested using fossil fuels. Our transportation even when electrified is still fossil fuel derived for most of the world.   My point is there is no way to get away from using fossil fuels with the exception of becoming a hunter gatherer which the earth can not sustain 7.6+ billion people (and growing) living that lifestyle. \nAbout the only realistic thing you can do is reduce your personal consumption of non renewable resources by using things all the way to the end of thier life cycle (such as a cell phone or automobile as two great examples) and purchasing things that are locally sourced (no more exotic fruit/food for example that was imported from 1000s of miles away). \nSolar isn't realistic for most people and nor is wind, geo thermal is only possible for a few select places and fission nuclear waste although pretty clean the waste will all live every society in the world quite possibly combined.

That's why there are a ton of them in places like the Columbia river and Colorado river. The space constraints dont matter as much with canyons because it's really easy to make the artificial lake taller rather than wider and you can more easily do multiple dams in series, which generates more power vs area and water. The ecological effects can be easily minimized by installing fish ladders and similar systems. There are smaller dams that dont require alot of area or large retention ponds but you just dont get nearly the return on investment, they're smaller, and theyre less predictable since they cant store as much power. Dams are also an issue in that there just isnt that many rivers that can be easily dammed since you really need some mountain pass, gorge, or similar natural formation to butt your dam against and to act as a retention lake AND it had to be a decent sized river. Those 2 traits alone disqualify most of the planet since you usually have a major river in a flat area (like the Mississippi) or you have a weak river near its source in the mountains. Then theres still the transmission problem since most cities arent built near large gorges in the mountains, they're usually near the coast or a plain", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Arthas Menethil", "channel": "UCHcMjSd4O15PvyXjBgG9Rzw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQBgaRxKT_oPvLqfeTT7xvaF1VVChB3gshc_KUM8A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Mega, mega tons of paper and cardboard gets encapsulated.  However, Libraries and offices also archive a lot of paper and wood gets archived in buildings.  I decided to research the topic and realized that even with all the paper products archived, without stopping the burning of coal, it just won't matter.

Result: more carbon dioxide in atmosphere. This is what actually happens in southern Eastern Europe, particually in Ukraine: international \"Kyoto\" money are given to plant trees in Ukraine, they planting it in the natural steppes (of high conservation priority with tons of endangered steppe endemics), destroying it, in the few years there is no forest either, and they planting it AGAIN.
