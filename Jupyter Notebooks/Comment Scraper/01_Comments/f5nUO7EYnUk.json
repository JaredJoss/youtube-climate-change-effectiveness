An example when we have corporations polluting water like Flint Michigan and the contamination of lead in dinking systems is causing health issues and we have to ask ourselves are we doing justice or helping the American people so stop saying that people are getting wealthier, safer, and are living longer. Also when you talk about the energy industry oh what do we give that to the corporation's government and corporations will not solve this but more responsible people have to act. We don't have good storage devices to save energy and most of the energy we produce we waste a lot through poor management through citizens and the lack of good infrastructure for storage devices on the energy grids. Also when renewables come to mind they are not a solution when the infrastructure is bad and that is why we have a blackout in California because of the lack of infrastructure. But comparatively better to fossil fuels in the case of fossil fuels but does cause damage to the environment and so that is the issue it is poor management/usage and infrastructure.

The question is the extent of the damage that might arise from an increase in CO2 concentrations. In such regards estimates vary, however usually climate scientists and activists follow a more robust approach as the consequences of inaction might be severe. The thing with nuclear energy is that it ticks all the boxes. It provides clean energy and could be considered more capitalist-friendly, which (by the way) I'm not against. Even if you were to doubt the science behind fossil fuels' role in climate change, you would have to agree that fossil fuel burning has caused, especially in areas where they are burnt more, severe respiratory health problems and cancers across demographics. If you were to argue that the energy generated by fossil fuels has overall in many cases increased the standard of living of individuals, you should still support nuclear over fossil fuel energy as it will further decrease the number of deaths caused by cancers whilst still keeping the standard of living at the same level. \nI think people on both sides need to be looking at this issue on a practical standpoint. Endlessly burning fossil fuels, in the long run, is not sustainable, whilst completely relying on wind and solar energy would decrease the overall standard of living. The thing is nobody has proposed legislation for increasing the degree of nuclear energy use, some movements on the left have largely given it a bad name whilst conservatives have not supported it either (rather relying on fossil fuels).", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Bingothedog", "channel": "UCda3pR9caxJF_HOIUFKriQA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTPn5HTNda1DDSUezWR3PKIpvALvJzHbvBKn3HK=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Also teach statistics & aware of how a lot of this data is being fudged (that's a polite term for manipulated)! Personally always go back to the raw data, its enlightening. Yes, CO2 is a greenhouse gas but to suggest a trace gas, 0.03%  of the atmosphere drives climate is not supportable (it also lags behind temperature). What's being used to make predictions that's scaring the crap out of our young are simplistic models which for the past 20 years have given incredible over estimates of the actual (recorded) data. Better to look to man made chemicals like sulphur hexaflouride, a greater greenhouse component which no one is talking about. Personally not alarmed by CO2 levels but am concerned about use of plastics, pollution, species loss, habitat fragmentation, degradation & loss.\nYou might want to check out Lorenz on climate modelling.

But you also need to understand the types of models being used, how these evolved and what the input. As to proxy data there are literally thousands of papers on e g. Pollen analysis from the Holocene to present day that are used to reconstruct the landscape. The Connolly's two papers looking at gasses in the troposphere are also excellent. 2014 I believe. Try Google scholar if you dont have access to research databases. Even archives of news paper reports in the 1920s and 30s are eye opening as they were experiencing higher temperatures and for extended periods, (unlike the odd day we have).

Global temperature is a very difficult thing to actually look at. The science of it is very interesting. There was no records of world temperatures until very recent when satellites were used to determine average temperatures around the world. To estimate temperatures before that they use tree rings and ice cores. There is a lot of evidence that shows temperate increase influence CO2 in the atmosphere.

How does he know that?   I suppose PragerU thinks these flimsy nonsensical arguments will delude their fan base.  Probably will unfortunately.  Also I am curious.  Since according to Dennis Prager, google and YT are seriously limiting his free speech rights -- how exactly was he able to post this on YT two days ago?\n\nIt sounds like PragerU argument here is that the government should not step in to reduce fossil fuels and promote renewable.  Imagine if the US government followed PragerU advice on clean air and clean water.  The US wouldn't have some of the cleanest air and cleanest water in the world due to the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.  So Prager -- what exactly is the role of government in reducing fossil fuel use?  You guys love to complain.  Do you have a solution about anything?\n\nAlex Epstein claims that nuclear energy 'has been smeared as unsafe'.  Huh?  Talking about meltdowns in Chernobyl and Japan is a form of smearing?  Maybe, either that or it is simply a form of sharing the truth.  Nuclear energy is the safest form of energy ever created?  Even though it has by far the greatest potential for long term health and environment damage of any human activity?  How many millions experienced severe health issues in Hiroshima from what Epstein calls, 'the safest form of energy ever created'?  How the heck is nuclear safer that solar or wind or hydrothermal power?

Link:  https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/solutions/global-warming-solutions-fight-misinformation\n\n\nIt's true that the Earth's climate has been changing naturally in the past with hotter and colder periods and varying levels of CO2. That's stating the obvious. There are a number of factors that affect the climate including the sun's intensity, volcanoes, and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and any combination of these factors are in play at any given time. The climate scientists have ruled out the sun and volcanoes as factors in the current warming period. Natural changes in the climate occur very gradually, over thousands or millions of years. And while it's true that the global temp has risen only about 2 deg F in 100 years, this is about 170 times faster than in any past natural warming period. This video misrepresents all of these facts.\n\n\nIMO, the most important topic the video fails to mention are carbon tax and cap-and-trade programs that allow for the continued use of fossil fuels, but at reduced carbon emission levels. These programs are have been successful in a number of countries and a few US states.

If she says \"Oh okay, yea you're right I should go change my ways!\" Then what? Then will Piers Morgan agree that climate change is real? Is that the point? Or will he just say \"Oh sorry I don't care, I still think it's a hoax.\" Why does she have to jump through that hoop to get an opinion from him? Either way, it's not relevant to the issue, which is do you think climate change should be addressed. It's simply a dodge from saying no I don't think it should be addressed. It's ad hominem, and it's illogical. Most of the greenhouse emissions are caused by a handful of companies, which is why we need change at the policy level.

They don't understand that they are actually anti climate, because they are not imformed about the č02 /carbon famine. I'm been a fruit vegetable grower, we now how to add c02 in both air and soil, to make same size same health apples as last year, every three years we add 40 percent more than three years ago. The Dutch flower growers and canna growers doing the same. EDUCATE YOURSELF ABOUT THE Č02 FAMINE. Č02 IS ENERGY FOR ALL LIVING THINGS. the climate protesters pulling the wrong way, the protesters is what spider mites is to fruit tress (strangling them to death) only the climate freaks doing it to the earth. If we don't stop them next generation has to pay breathing fees and buy breathing rights when going on vacation, people will have č02 added oxygen cans attached to their air conditioning, making it very difficult to travel outside without expensive cars with Co 2 air conditioning systems. This is a part of the depopulation programme and also linked to the getting rid of powerty agenda. As well as the kalergi plan its all linked together by organizations and the two most dangerous ones are open society and private organisations that controls eu. They just released a list on their website of trusted friends and allies. People like Angela Merkel and guy marine Marie vonhofstadt, which has one of the power positions in eu and acts like the boss of Europe and also many high military officers from member nations. They are now payed by open society for making eu policies and are not chosen or voted in by anyone. Eu is only their to control the means of production and be the middle man where that's difficult to skim the top with eu fees etc. Europe is controlled by communist powers))) and are the greatest treath to the European indigenous population. And we now have dark hidden policy's in the police, if you are robbed by a minority gang it's always your fault, no matter if they stab you before trying to rob you. If i could lay out pictures i would. When you are attracted in Norway almost killed but managed to protect yourself, the robbers get sendt to something called dps where they work on the trauma of not being able to kill and rob the indigenous population. While the victim has to pay fines which is always a lot more than the criminals tried to rob you for, and the criminals get that money to deal with their trauma. It's designed to not make it difficult for the robbers. If you knock them out you will be charged for sadistic behaviour and using too much force in self defense. Self defense is now illegal in practice (except if you are very wealthy and powerful) only emergency self preservation is now legal,, so it has to be easy to prove that you would die if you did not do it. Many drug addicts use this system, they get a lot of dope and instead of paying they admit that they were attacking the dealer, so the dealer gets up to a million in court and the drug addict is then a debt slave, the state pays most of the reparations. This happened to my parents several times they are borned addicts and never got well (it the people from the helicopter case in Norway England, (Howard Brothers etc etc).. My education is ruined because I stopped a gang rape on the handicap toilet at Holmlia skole.. I was one of five Norwegian in the class of 36 students. About 70 percent was from the same village in Lahore and was all related (they only marry inside their closest family 👪 cousins is the rule, so they don't have to pay another family but keep the wealth inside the family. This is all connected and together because this sects are the in every aspect of it. And it's all connected trough eu IMF un open society org open borders org and even doctors without borders who owns aquarius the NGO ship coming to cologne etc with mainly men in military (jihad) age.

You haven't yet once acknowledged that you understand the point I've been trying to make. I'll say it once more. Why does it matter whether or not she truly, deep down, believes the things she says? The only thing that matters is whether or not climate change is something that should be addressed. One is a question of science. The other is an ad hominem attack on a person. He does this to turn public opinion against her, not because he really thinks he is making an original or relevant point. It is a distraction from the scientific issue that she is trying to discuss. So apparently every time we have this discussion we have to go through that infuriating sequence where one side questions the other sides deepest motivations? Didn't you see how she smiled tolerantly the instant he started to ask that question. Couldn't you see the weariness at being hit with that stupid line once again, when she just wanted to talk about the actual topic? I am actually curious at what you think about climate change. I think it is natural, like you say, and, also, that we are speeding it up somewhat. Also, by taking drastic actions we could slow it down somewhat. That much seems pretty well settled to me. And yet it seems like alot of people's attitude is just to say no, and fight against people who are trying to cause change. What good does that do? You say \"should all this scaremongering come to fruition.\" Why would the DOD be creating plans and reports about things that only amount to scaremongering? Are they required to make plans to prepare for any possibility that any whack job happens to come up with? I doubt it, I imagine they only make plans based off only the most trusted scientific predictions available.

Apart from sending us back to the dark ages and the total collapse of commerce, nothing. Why not attack the major producers of CO2, stand outside their embassies? They are attacking the wrong people, their message and demands were obscure at least and unreasonable at best. For example, If someone is telling you to give up meat, it is very hard to take them seriously, if they are stuffing a bacon sandwich into their gobs. That is the point Piers was trying to make.\nThe whole man made global warming thing is a scam. Designed to take control of people and make money from cap and trade. The whole thing has been marketed like a new religion. There are alternative scientific views, but they are silenced by ridicule in the media and funding removed. Only the 'correct' view is funded and pushed forward. Anyone who does not bow to the new religion is excommunicated, unpersoned, unplatformed, shamed and ridiculed. Hence the DOD report.

And the source you provided shows how CO2 concentrations have increased dramatically within a 60 year period. 1700-1950 the concentration went from ~278 to ~315 ppm. 1960 to present ~409. It seems to be the highest and quickest increase in CO2 for the past 800,000 according to this source of course. I did not however check how accurate the testing methods were with the ice sheets.

A lot of private companies are doing great things to give us greener options as well. Its up to private industries and individuals to be green.  Not the governement. They already give you a write off for green power. Theyll pay you to get solar power. Whats your carbon footprint like? Also wheres the rebuttal about the ice age?

Just a little bit ago pg&e shut down service to several counties, killing at least 1 person, to prevent fires.\n\nRight now the way most people get electricity is without choice.  It is managed as a public utility, if you don't like it you have to move.  With solar you finally have a choice,  and a really good one, one that public utilities are also choosing,  because they are a good investment long term.  So you can choose to stay within the shackles while the utilities switch over to renewables,  which they will,  or start choosing which installers you want to use, which brands of consumer solar products you want, and then decide what you want to do with the power you make.\n\nThe trick that these two sides are playing is one for power, neither side wants to see you with more of it.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "happypup70", "channel": "UCxJoVTI31xShM0OD-EM9Ofg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRIwYhG7rNC9ZaRzsXEqETHtIibk5x5WnLvwQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

But there is a large upfront cost with renewables.  The government wants us to pay that bill for them.  The fossil fuel industry doesn't want the bill to be paid.

So this little increase does have significant effects on the environment. The thing is, it's not like everything becomes warmer, rather, warm and dry years become hotter, humid areas become wetter, come areas become colder, etc. Basically the climate becomes more extreme. \nAnyone who understands how hurricanes and such things are formed will now understand that because of the more extreme climate hurricanes will happen more frequently. \n\nThe melting of the ice caps is real. We have 2 ice sheets in the North. The North Pole and Greenland. The North Pole had somewhat recovered, but Greenland is now green. Which is a bag thing, because netto wise, we are still losing ice. \n\n3rd I am not saying climate change is man made. \n\n4th I do think we should try to do something about it, but what Greta Thunberg and the fff guys demand is just impossible.

According to a report dating March 2019 (8 years after) it's starting to get better, but the dangerous substances in the reactors won't be replaced/dealt with for many, many decades. The ambiant radioactivity levels close to the reactor are twice what you need to kill a man instantly. Even the robots they send in to film the situation have two hours of operation time before their wirings are destroyed by the radiations.\n\nThe releasing of progressively more substances into the oceans IS a problem that threatens the food industry at large. Consuming trace plastics and trace radioactivity is linked to a plethora of health issues, ranging from digestive issues to cancer.\n\nI agree the Green New Deal's a scam. But Nuclear as a main focus? Not so quick to throw my cash in. In Quebec, 96% of our electricity comes from hydroelectricity, and our total energy production is enough to cover a third of Canada, approximately.

I don't agree with their deadlines, reported magnitudes or degrees of crisis, and etc. But I'll be damned if conservatives tell me our direction as a race isn't pointed towards the kind of world the left says we're eventually approaching. I'm sure it's not 12 years left but if animal and plant species go dying left and right, what do you think will happen to us humans? Established and fundamental scientific facts taught to us even as early as 9 or 10 yrs old about the importance of ecosystems and its balance say it all. Industrial sewage, plastics and other petrochemical products and byproducts cause indubitable damage and harm to various sectors of Earth life (thats another thing with PragerU vids, can we please stop ONLY talking about human this and human that. We depend more on animals and plants than they do humans). Don't get me wrong, I love PragerU. I strongly believe in PragerU's mission to educate the world on social science, history, economics, political science, good values, and simply being the best humans we possibly can to each other. But speaking in terms of other elements in our environment, natural resources, and the like, the long term of our species doesn't appear to be sunshine and rainbows. How PragerU skillfully rebuts the left's alarmist rhetoric to instantly take control of key industries of the world is a blessing because I too believe they're scary desperate megalomaniacal people masquerading as omnibenevolent government elites. I hope this sinks in even just a little. I acknowledge the immeasurable good fossil fuels have done for us all. But the reality is that it will have to be a balancing act, living on this planet. Not talking about the multitudes of species that have died out over the past 6 decades is just an out of sight, out of mind scenario. To make things worse, whenever you read things on the paper about dead whales filled with plastic, injured turtles, and highly developed nations illegally shipping their garbage in the tons to third world nations, you can't deny these are likely just a few of the many indicators signaling ecological crisis.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "John Paul San Luis", "channel": "UCgssfHq5u8hMZ6Tn2M934Dg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQQbMp54EkDV_Wl72-SsiP-lIBwtkByAEOtpg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

If someone were to tell a true liberal/progressive that “the right is the cause if all problems,” we’d tell them that’s nuts. You have your PraegerU.  We have nothing like it on the left. If somehow BernieU was established and took the approach that the right is wrong, the right is the cause of all problems, we’d tune it out for the same reason: it is insane.\n\nYou believe that the nation would be better off if all liberals left. We on the left believe we are best off if we all stay and work together\n\nYour “enemy” is the left. Nour enemy...if we have one..is the oligarchy, the elites, the 1%ers who have no political philosophy at all, just pure greed. You think the left are the monsters. We think the elitests are monsters to both left and RIGHT\n\nMuch of you think the new green deal is absurd. Many on the left disagree. Who’s git it right? You guys. But don’t look at that as a cause of happiness.  The Green New Deal is ridiculous because earth is in the throes of the collapse of industrials civilization and a habitate that humans can survive. We’re toast. And no one really cares if you believe this or not. Climate change is but one souse of what is killing us.  So many others, too many to mention, include degredation of soil, extraction to the point of destrucion, sea level rise, acidification of the oceans. The sixth mass extinction, permafrost melt releasing methane. All on a planet with 9,000,000,000 people sucking up resources like they were \nendless\n\nYou want to know the answer? You have it. You don’t need an expert to tell you what is obvious\n\nAnd who is responsible for this mess: neither you nor I.  We’ve been building towards this moment since civilization first developed. It was inevitable\n\nSo you can and will make this progessive//liberal your enemy. Happily for me, I can’t nor won’t make you mine. Which is a damned good thing because I have to live with myself.

It (at least in my state when it wad proposed 2 years ago) would apply to all companies and factories that produce a certain level of CO2. That is not a policy related to an individuals carbon footprint. It is about a company's carbon footprint. That would change individual carbon footprint depending on how you look at it (like peoples heating and power sources producing less CO2 and other greenhouse gasses). It also would by proxy make gas more expensive, but that is a side affect of the main point of the policy. Also, could you please explain why you believe in climate change denial?

Only a few years ago, not all villages had electricity in every home. They went for alternative solution. They bought solar panels for their rooftop. And within a couple of years, hundreds of villages became almost fully powered with solar panels. Hundreds of thousands of people became fully dependent on the solar power. Now the situation is, they can pay the local government for electric connection but they don't. They like solar power. It costs them nearly nothing except for replacing the battery every once in a while. This solar power is a great solution when the energy requirement is low and people gets to implement it without help or interference of the government. \nSo why not western countries use Solar power as an auxiliary source of power ?? Just put it in the rooftop and use it for minor things in the household. The benefits are minuscule but so is the cost. And with millions of people using this, we could remove 1-2 coal plants.

{"cid": "UgzitI2XFz2HiuW2q0V4AaABAg", "text": "I am not a fan of nuclear energy mainly because of the toxic waste it produces which is much more hazardous than the toxic wastes from burning fossil fuels and so requires extensive care in its safe segregation from the bio-sphere, for many, many years and thus problematic long term when considering possible breakdowns in containment of these wastes, perhaps due to natural disasters e.g. Fukushima.  A new discovery, requiring new physics to fully understand has recently been revealed and promises a better energy option in the future and incidentally may allow for the detoxification of nuclear waste.  Fusion energy has long been touted as the next great advancement in energy production but such efforts remain so far impossible and extremely expensive, until now.  The SAFIRE project has demonstrated the creation of heavier elements from lighter elements which normally would be called fusion, but because the process happens outside of accepted physical laws, the project team decided to use the term Transmutation rather than Fusion.  This feat was accomplished using very little power, something like 1800 Watts.  One must ask why this discovery is not worldwide news.  I don't have an answer to that question, but be assured that this very promising, paradigm changing research will be and is continuing and so bodes well for our future.

She said that all of these initiatives were not about an individual's carbon footprint. Do you not see how dangerous such a sentiment/belief is? If it is no longer the responsibility of the individual, who remains to be responsible? The answer. The very government/groups that she is advocating for in order to gather more power. All power in a government or group comes from those that comprise it and it is the individual's sense of responsibility that guarantees that the government or group remains loyal to the ideas that made them. When people reject their own responsibility and leave things up to the government or group, we end up with things going as they are now. Every time the people give up a little of their responsibility to some group or government, they lose a bit of their power and that makes it easier for the group or government to take more. There is a reason that old adages stick around. Like the one that says, \"If you give an inch, they'll take a mile.\" I hope you seriously think about this.

No one in this thread is saying that carbon dioxide is causing the sun to shine brighter. \n \nThe reason it was called the greenhouse effect was because it's an analogy! \nGreenhouses get and stay warmer due to several different types of phenomenon. \nThe main analogy is that some types of glass are translucent to infrared radiation. \n \nHere is a lesson in English for you. \nAn analogy must be comparable to the thing you are comparing it with. \n \nHere is a science lesson for you:\nHeat is transmitted in three different ways. Convection, conduction, and radiation. \nSo your first analogy would only apply to my argument if I was claiming that heat was being trapped by convection; I was not, I said some of the infrared radiation was absorbed or scattered, due to carbon dioxide being translucent to infrared.

Does not really matter, the climatealarmists claim the poles will melt, and that will lead to sealevels rising. I have solved that issue, if it ever existed.And the ice on top of the water is the issue here. It is to keep icebergs from breaking apart. I want to do something about that anyways, since I like penguins and other animals. And the southern parts seem to be in danger of breaking up. \n\nYes it will stop the ice at the sealevel from melting, since it is protecting it. In the summertime the seatemperature at antarctiva is around 0 degree, to a few degrees minus. That is the issue here. Seawater melts at minus 2. Big difference. And it is that erroding effect along with wavebreaks that break up icebergs. The temperature on land is like minus 14-25 at the same time. So that is not the issue.

But it was not proposed by the left you got in the US now, which are not leftists, they are nutjobs. Demons. Dancers in delusions.\n\nThey were correct on the oxone layer issue, just lied about how dire it was.\n\nThey were correct on local pollutions. We have the evidence. We got the cancerrecords from east europe with their low pipes suffocating people in pollution. Same thing with emissions into drinking water. But again, the todays left, are only marxists, the same cloth of the marxists who poisoned their people back then.\n\nNot really wrong on peak oil. USA just found one of the biggest oilfields lately, and developed fracking, and oilsand extraction lately, so more reserves in the US. Peak oil is past in most of the developed world and arabic states. And you have new tech that has enabled fields that were projected to have 5% extraction possibility, to be like 25% now. But it does not change the fact of the reserves that they projected. Peak oil is past. And some areas that were impossible to develop in the 80s, are now possible. \n\nThe great drought is real. And that is why the human race ended itself. We will have wars for aid and water soon. Arabic nations have ignored the groundwaterlevels, and depleted it totally. They hardly produce any foods of their own, all import, and only have a few percentages left. It takes hundreds of years, if not thousands to fill up. They are doomed. Just kept making babies with no sense at all. When their oilmoney runs out, they will wage war with nations for water and import of food. I pity the nations who sell them food now, and will stop doing it in the future, because they will attack.

Well it’s keep your mouth shut and follow the sheep so you can keep your job and feed your family or speak out and loose your job. And like he said. They tried to lock him in a confidentiality agreement so he couldn’t defend himself. And none of us could know about it. Thousands upon thousands of dollars later he had won his case against the university. How many scientists have been fired and told to keep silent?

Also, it will sound something like: \"A large group of scientists agree that\"... Is this how science is done; by vote? TRUE science has nothing to do with consensus. Science requires investigators and researchers who've found \"FACTS\" via repetition, measurement, and observation. Consensus is irrelevant. If its consensus, its not science. Consensus is invoked only in situations where there is a political, social, or $$$ gain w/o scientific support, and climate change has created the [no pun intended], \"perfect storm.\" No one ever says \"the consensus of a large number of scientists is that E=MC square\" or you'll never hear \"the consensus of a large number of scientists is that the sun is 93 million miles from the earth\"...statements like these are not made b/c they're FACTS. You don’t need a consensus b/c it has NOTHING to do with it. YOU DON'T VOTE ON FACTS. Did you know that there is absolutely NO extant \"scientific\" data [observable evidence] regarding Co2 or carbon, showing that mankind contributes to warming...NONE...its ALL merely theory i.e. \"consensus science\" which it has to be b/c its NOT; let me repeat; NOT evidenced via observation / science! Actually the opposite [scientifically] appears to be true, and this is what happens in layman’s terms. The sun gets hotter, and as it fluctuates, it gets hotter at certain times more than at other times, and when that happens it warms the oceans. As the oceans are warmed, THEY release more Co2 [which IS a scientific FACT, and has been for decades]. So, the sun determines the warming. The warming then effects the oceans, meaning that the oceans release more Co2 into the atmosphere. The \"fact\" then is this: Its NOT ppl putting Co2 into the atmosphere that warms the climate, its the sun that warms the climate, and the oceans are putting more Co2 in the atmosphere. ALL \"honest\" legitimate science shows that the human contribution to Co2 is barely negligible. Water vapor and clouds make up almost ALL Co2. Climate change then, is the effect of electro magnetic fields on the sun THEREFORE; environmentalists who say we’re increasing the amount of Co2, and consequently warming the environment currently are, and have been, \"purposefully lying\" b/c they ALL HAVE this scientific proof/data, yet they have NO real scientific support or data for what they have been telling the public, but what they do have is much more $$$ for their research. This link is a wealth of real \"science and information\" regarding Lomborg's latest work concerning Global Warming: https://cei.org/blog/bjorn-lomborg-and-john-christy-shred-climate-alarmism\n\n\nWhat does all this prove? Real science [measurable, repetitive, and that which is observable, which is what science means] regarding climate change has only been being measured for a few decades; thats it, and the earth’s temperature has risen 1-2 degrees [depending on which study is sited]. The best that REAL science can tell, from 1940 to 1970, it was cooler than it’s been from the 70s to the present. So it has gotten a little warmer. But we really don’t know how many times that’s happened in the past b/c we don’t have any way to measure it. All we really KNOW is that the temperature is up 1-2 degrees; whoopee!!! The actual truth is this: the most accurate, and the latest science says that there is a direct correlation between sun spots, and climate changes. Also, sun spots are visible, and discernible meaning that solar variations are driven by temperature. The sun is the source of temperature changes with its infrared variations which, like I said, IS discernible so ACTUAL SCIENCE can be done. As a Christian, I believe what the Bible teaches regarding our planets last days; the earth is in the hands of its creator God, therefore; nothing except God will have any effect on its ending. https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-361   /   https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-362/~/about    /   We should NEVER be irresponsible with what we've been blessed with, but understand that a \"new\" $16 trillion, U.S. proposition is foolish, and futile. Do our U.S. politicians believe that America represents the entire world? Will China, India, Russia and so on, invest multiple trillions to \"save the planet\" via OUR new deal? These scenarios will not work, even if the earth were pristine TODAY, and if the whole earth emitted \"zero\" Co2 emissions from this point on. Please don't let this next statement cause you to stop reading b/c you don't believe in God. This is valid scientific evidence even for atheists. The Bible states exactly how \"things will end\" and none of them are related to polar ice caps melting, asteroids hitting the earth, or any other \"alien\" man made fears. God will \"uncreate\" all that He has created just as scripture says: \"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth, and its works will be burned up\" [2 Peter 3:10]. Sadly, people today dismiss the accounts and warning given in the Bible; accounts such as \"Noah's flood\" even though the earth is replete with \"clear factual scientific evidence\" of that event. Its even more clear WHY scientists desire an alternative answer. Scientists understand the fallout of admitting to Biblical \"truth\" meaning, that if it is found to be true, there should then be a need to adhere to the rest of what the Bible says, and people are purposefully unwilling to do that. I only know of ONE scientist who was honest enough to admit to why he didn't want the Bibles claims to be found true: Aldous Huxley; who openly admitted that his rejection of religion was due to the fact that he did not want his sexual freedom hindered! [Jackson 1974, 3]. This is the truth of things and \"truth\" is a stubborn thing. Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is near. Isaiah 55:6 \n\n\nIf you are a student of \"facts\" and have found yourself being convinced by facts in your life time, these should interest you if you're willing to watch: Is the Bible a fact or a fairy tale?  https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/SC12-1/confidence-in-gods-word-as-it-is-written\n\nBible Validated By Prophecy pt 1    https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-328  \n\nBible Validated By Prophecy pt 2  https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-329\n\nJesus and Scripture Validated  https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/2020/the-mysterious-jesus\n\n\"While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease\" Genesis 8:22 Nothing is going to threaten our existence unless the God of the Bible; the creator of ALL things, allows it.

He undoubtedly helped us not die about 75,000 years ago, but that was carried out by us. He hasn't done much since then. He wants us to learn by ourselves. \n\nSecond, after a child grows to a certain age, parents relax their restrictions on them.

I’m certainly not a Piers Morgan fan, but every product he mentioned is engineered and/or produced with and by fossil fuels, and because they are produced with a cheap energy source, everyone CAN have them and take them for granted.  The anti-fossil-fuels folks seem to never stop and think what is truly produced with FFs—-of course gas, heating oil and electricity, but also majority of clothes, plastic, roads, etc etc.  Thinking that Elon Musk isn’t using fossil fuels to produce electric cars or that the electricity needed to run them can be made without a significant FF source, would be pure ignorance and just silly.  Without significant fossil fuels, we would very quickly cease to being a civilization, and I think that is the point.  According to the loudest voices in the climate-crisis rhetoric, the US “needs to be knocked down a peg” .  History has taught the enemies of the US that a frontal attack does little more than unite American citizens, kick the US industry into high gear, and solidify their resolve.  Because of the US and what its free markets have created in industrial and military power, the only real way to attack and destroy the US is from within, by removing part of the source of its power by over-regulation, excess taxation or social destruction....how it goes doesn’t really matter to them and they are hitting it from all sides.
