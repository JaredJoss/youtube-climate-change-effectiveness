The problem is, only a small percentage of the papers fall into this category; Cook does not say what percentage, but when the study was publicly challenged by economist David Friedman, one observer calculated that only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming.\n\n\nCook had created a category called ‚Äúexplicit endorsement without quantification‚Äù‚Äîthat is, papers in which the author, by Cook‚Äôs admission, did not say whether 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. He had also created a category called ‚Äúimplicit endorsement,‚Äù for papers that imply (but don‚Äôt say) that there is some man-made global warming and don‚Äôt quantify it. In other words, he created two categories that he labeled as endorsing a view that they most certainly didn‚Äôt.\n\n\nThe 97 percent claim is a deliberate misrepresentation designed to intimidate the public‚Äîand numerous scientists whose papers were classified by Cook protested:\r\n\r\n‚ÄúCook survey included 10 of my 122 eligible papers. 5/10 were rated incorrectly. 4/5 were rated as endorse rather than neutral.‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄîDr. Richard Tol\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThat is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄîDr. Craig Idso\r\n\r\n‚ÄúNope . . . it is not an accurate representation.‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄîDr. Nir Shaviv\r\n\r\n‚ÄúCook et al.

Eample, 96% of scientists are not climatologists, but the set-up for the joke omits that fact to increase the level of irony to maximize laugh potential. Laughs are not guaranteed so stack everthing in your favor, truth be damned. Truth is, that's what pays your bills and I'm sure you make a hell of lot more than any climatologist. Even better, you are your own boss accountable to nobody as long as you keep the laughs coming the skies are sunny.\nIn truth and stark contrast, climatologists make a small fraction of your income. They are never their own boss and accountable to who signs their paycheck. Most all work for Universities or governments. Two entities that are dependent on taxpayers. Politicians, like any comedian out for a buck, need to properly set-up a \"select\" set of facts before delivering the punchline, in this case \"Global Warming\". As not to discredit all climatologists they reach their conclusions based on data provided to them by mostly other government agencies who all work for the people that sign their paycheck, ultimately politicians. Select data can only produce select results \"scientifically\".\nArmed to install fear with this \"select\" set of facts the politicians not only deliver the punchline but insist the only solution is to extract more taxes from their citizens to save their children.

Copernicus brought heliocentrism to astronomy in the 1540s, long before Galileo's model of the solar system brought in elliptical orbits to replace the circular orbits of the then-current model; and a decade before he was even born.  Hell, the book he wrote comparing Ptolmeic geocentrism to Copernican heliocentrism was published over 15 years after the Roman Inquisition investigated him and his theories.\n\nWhat Galileo got into trouble for was the fact that his \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" followed the tradition of a Socratic dialogue (wherein the new ideas are questioned by a secondary characters, allowing the writer's/ scientist's/ philosopher's self-insert character to describe relevant facets as answers to those questions,.  One of the questioners in Galileo used championed the theories and arguments of Ptolmeic geocentrism; but Galileo's characterization of him made him look like a complete and total idiot (And was, in fact, even named \"Simplicio\").\n\nNormally, this would be dismissed as petty rivalry among competing theorists, but unfortunately that man who was being satirized was the Pope at the time  who, what with the Protestant Reformation just getting into full swing, was trying to smooth the ruffled feathers of the political factions within the Church by getting Galileo to at least include their geocentric, academically backsliding, beliefs in his book (Kind of like how GOP senators have to be given their opportunity to smear their \"I'm no scientist, but...\" feces all over what might otherwise turn into a discussion about reality with practical use to anyone involved.).  Needless to say, it didn't work out so well.\n\nThen, the story got popularized by the Protestant side; lost quite a bit of accuracy in favour of becoming anti-Catholic propaganda; and turned into the \"Galileo was the only Italian with the guts to stand up to the Papal morons!\" bumper sticker we have today, as tends to happen whenever politics get involved...", "time": "5 months ago", "author": "BoojumFed", "channel": "UCMCGtyIScCTT70YvjLiqEbg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTjuoQ1_Bbcw078ph6MhK0w5Me8V2vtOWd5xw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

When it comes it\nwill come quickly.From scientific research the danger to human beings will emanate from air pollution and shortage of water.

They know the truth but refrain from informing people of the situation for whatever reason. The USA is supposed to be zero-carbon by the year 2030. By that time it will be too late as it will be impossible to reverse the situation to pull out of the nose-dive to regain environmental equilibrium. Make as much fun as you like.

There are a number of reasons for this, e.g. the oceans buffering warmth. The study now published by the German team of scientists shows that man-made global warming has not been pausing - it was temporarily superimposed and therefore hidden by long-term natural climate fluctuations like in Antarctica. ‚ÄúOur estimates show that we are currently facing a natural cooling period ‚Äì while temperatures nonetheless rise slowly but inexorably, due to our heating up the atmosphere by emitting greenhouse gas emissions,‚Äù explains Hans Joachim Schellnhuber. ‚ÄúAt the end of this natural cold spell temperatures will rise even more fiercely. Globally, but also in Antarctica which therefore is in danger of tipping.‚Äù¬† In fact, in March 2015 two Antarctic measuring stations registered high-temperature records. \"\n\n\nhttps://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/climate-change-in-antarctica-natural-temperature-variability-underestimated-cold-spell-superimposes-man-made-warming", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Dan H", "channel": "UCDvF4TSgWSYaeCdASAlHWcA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRi-DBytWIU2QfUFr06BTyC4hVpKiq9MM1Q0g=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugg0CIvEim0P8HgCoAEC", "text": "Gus Sandborg,\nRE: the climate has change before.\n\nIt is true that the climate has changed before. We understand fairly well the mechanisms through which changes have occurred on the regional and global scales. Over the long-term (thousands of years) the earth's climate is controlled by orbital cycles which control the amount and seasonality of insolation received at the earth's surface (particularly at high latitudes). On shorter timescales solar variability and volcanism play a role - these combined factors and their resultant impacts on the oceans have lead to periodic warming events such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. However, these natural factors are not the main causes of recent warming. We can be assured of this for two reasons - one, solar output has been declining since the ~1960s overall and two, volcanism has occurred often enough that it should have a substantial cooling impact on the earth's climate.\n\nIn contrast, we have a radiatively active greenhouse gas (CO2) which has been added to the atmosphere in ever increasing amounts. Satellite measurements can detect less heat escaping to space (e.g. an increasing greenhouse effect) and ground based measurements detect more longwave radiation hitting the surface of the earth. Beyond this today the satellite measurements are precise enough that we can actually evaluate which wavelengths are allowing heat to escape into space - overall there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of heat escaping to space at the wavelengths where CO2 is important.\n\nThat climate has changed before does not mean that climate change today cannot be anthropogenically driven - in fact it exemplifies how sensitive the climate can be.\n\nIf I can make a suggestion that may help you better understand climate change, I suggest that you read an introductory level and then a graduate level physical geography textbook - it may help you with understanding the key role that Greenhouse Gases have played throughout the Earth's history.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Robert Way", "channel": "UCsN_-xxILne-z1LU_D4U-OA", "votes": "17", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQH13e1exje9F1MWphDd9KZxf5nUA2Olvcel1RZ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
