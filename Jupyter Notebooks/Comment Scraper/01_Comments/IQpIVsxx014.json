They sent a 2-minute online survey to 10,257 earth scientists. They got 3,146 responses to only these two questions…”\nThe first question asked, “When compared with pre-1800 levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?” The second asked, “Do you think that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?”\nNinety percent of the respondents said that the mean temp had risen, while 82 percent said that human activity was a significant factor. However, the term “significant” was never defined. Furthermore, according to the Heartland Institute, most skeptic scientists would agree with the statistic if the term was defined.\nThe video explains that when formulating the 97 percent statistic, researchers used only the responses from “climate scientists.” However, only 5 percent of the respondents – 79 people – were climate scientists.\n\nSo, out of 10,257 academics that the professor and graduate student identified as worthy survey participants, only 79 were in agreement with their final finding. When calculated, those 79 scientists – now accepted as 97 percent - make up a meager 0.77 percent of academics. And, since only 97 percent of the 79 answered positively (which would be 76.63 people – so we will round to 77), the percentage shrinks from 0.77 percent to 0.75 percent.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/do-97-scientists-really-believe-global-warming", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Michael Tillman", "channel": "UCLiSDXuEdNcEIVW5oZl0P2g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSTTDaWafq4qF5TA1--cLAvS2mzq1RWMxzwIJ2gXA0=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugxr0jaAPhU5V_Mkwhd4AaABAg", "text": "TOP 10 FACTS CLIMATE CHANGE FANATICS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW\n\n1. The current global warming started about 12,000 years ago. That's how the last ice age ended and the current geological period, the Holocene, began. This warm and cozy climate won't last forever. Interglacial periods last between 20,000 and 60,000 years.\n\n2. The rate at which the sea level is rising now is much lower compared to how it rose between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago – a period in which the sea level rose by 197 ft (60 m). Look up the Early Holocene Sea Level Rise if you want to learn more.\n\n3. The climate is always changing. There is no such thing as a stable climate. If you want to learn more about the \"stability\" of the climate, you might want to look up:\n– The 8.2 Kiloyear Event\n– The Little Ice Age\n– The Year Without a Summer (1816)\n\n4. Chaos Theory tells us why the behavior of some systems is unpredictable (chaotic). Even simple systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, like the double pendulum. No one can predict the climate, because the climate is a stupidly complex chaotic system.\n\n5. Compared to water, CO₂ plays an insignificant role in the global greenhouse effect. Because – and I'm not making this up – 95% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor. \n\n6.  During the Hirnantian glaciation the atmospheric CO₂ levels were 10–16 times higher than today. \n\n7. CO₂ is not a pollutant. CO₂ is plant food. Almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is a byproduct of photosynthesis – a process by which plants use light energy to produce glucose from CO₂ and water. Without CO₂ plants die. Without plants, we die. CO₂ is used in the food industry, for example, in the production of carbonated beverages like: beer, soda, sparkling water etc. CO₂ is also used in hospitals, for example, in laparoscopic surgery. There are real pollutants out there we should be worried about and CO₂ is not one of them.\n\n8. Compared to astronomical factors like solar activity or the Milankovitch Cycles or terrestrial factors like volcanic activity, human activity has an insignificant effect in the long term evolution of the climate. We cannot start, end, or prevent ice ages or global warmings. We're not a type I civilization.\n\n9. This may came as a shock to you, but we're actually in the middle of a 2.58-million-year-old glaciation – the Quaternary Glaciation – look it up!\n\n10.  There are many scientists who disagree with various aspects of anthropogenic climate change. One of them is Ivar Giaever, Nobel laureate in physics, who said that \"Global Warming is pseudoscience\". Freeman Dyson said that \"Climate Change predictions are absurd\". Wikipedia has a List of scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming, but it only contains the names of those scientists \"who have their own Wikipedia article.\" Keep in mind that science doesn't work by consensus. Science isn't a democracy. As Carl Sagan put it:\n\n“Science is more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking; a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then, we are up for grabs for the next charlatan (political or religious) who comes rambling along.”\n\nIn general, when you're convinced of your truth, make an effort to get out of the echo chamber and listen to a skeptic scientist who doesn't share your beliefs on the subject.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", "channel": "UCtvj8-yqUr9qHpRZLXO5V1g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ1bOB9AnngP3Pl3u1PVE_lXsj_UmDBvRxF8InHKg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

As we looked over the desert menu we could not help but notice the people sitting across from us were eating a very delicious looking chocolate cake.  We couldn't find it on the menu so when the waitress came over we told her that we would have 2 pieces of whatever cake the table across from us was eating.  The waitress brought us our cake and coffee and let us sample a new cookie the baker had made that day.  My friend and I were maybe into our 3rd bite of our delicious chocolate cake when we realized we were being approached by the people sitting across from us that gave us the wonderful idea to order the chocolate cake.  I couldn't think why they were coming over to our table - i thought maybe just to say hello - maybe they over heard us talking about my friends birthday - maybe they wanted to wish her a happy birthday - maybe they just wanted to see if we enjoyed the chocolate cake as much as they did.  I put down my fork and smiled as they approached .  \"DO YOU KNOW HOW FATTENING CHOCOLATE CAKE IS\"?  I had a total stranger barking in my ear causing a scene.  I could not believe what was going on.  Were you not just eating the same cake i kept thinking to myself...for heavens sake i got the idea from you - you were eating the same cake.  \"CHOCOLATE CAKE IS NO GOOD FOR YOU!!!!\" DO YOU KNOW WHAT A FAT PIG YOU LOOK LIKE EATING IT?\" YOU AND YOUR FRIEND MISS PIGGY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES EATING THAT CHOCOLATE CAKE\". And all the while she is yelling at me all i could do is stare at the chocolate on her chin she missed with her  napkin.  The manager finally came over and asked them to leave.  My friend and i sat quietly finishing our cake and coffee wondering what the heck just happened.  The manager picked up our tab wished my friend a Happy Birthday and we left.  *And this is how i feel about people who scream climate change into the face of others*  You might believe in something - just like the lady believed the cake was fattening - but only if someone else is eating it.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "SHASHA SHA", "channel": "UCKm47hUa8eLM5Tjnubijv8Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSEgtdvcOzIuE6Y3qtShaOj_d53sGdj1an0nQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyBON9TWcXg8MALX4l4AaABAg", "text": "Also as experienced by the Vikings when settling in Greenland around 1000 years ago, there are undeniable scientific proof that global warming is a cyclical phenomenon, partly as explained by the sun's irradiance and the Milanovitch cycles, precision of equinox, etc. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/4GUcn07enz4\n\nIf it is mostly related to human made CO2, IPCC's scientists need to explain why are the ice-caps on Venus melting, and why is Mars and Pluto warming up? The common nominator is Sun irradiance, the difference is that there are no human created CO2.\n\nYes, it is not being denied that we recently are witnessing record high CO2 levels in the atmosphere. This may well stem from the increased temperature, releasing stored CO2 from the oceans. \n\nBlaming humans for the global warming, however, is fraudulent. If human history proves anything, then it is that the future as a rule proves mainstream science wrong.\n\nTrue science serves humanity by moving boundaries, creating new frontiers. While in the hands of a global conspiratory power elite science turns fraudulent and suppressive through bribery.\n\nLike what we currently are witnessing, a new global climate religion is being socially engineered, hatched by a conspiratory power elite operating at the core of UN.\n\nThe prophet being a well spoken mentally disoriented child, lies and fearmongering being the gospel, pseudoscience it's saviour, politicians and main stream media the disciples, while a geopolitical power elite acting as the hidden God. \n\nThe unprecedented conspiracy in modern times appears being the precursor to the long planned New World Order. UN's Agenda 21 is sought financed through ever increasing taxes on energy, a modern day   'indulgence' ultimately aimed at bringing worldwide poverty, starvation and elimination of 80% of the global population. The 'lucky' 20% is planned to serve as slaves to the one world parasitic government. \n\nIt follows the well-known blueprint of the old Hegelian dialectics:\n\n1. Engineer a problem (i.e. global warming) \n2. Harvest a reaction (fear of extinction) \n3. Introduce solutions (CO2 taxation)\n\nFollowing the perpetual war on terrorism, global warming appears being a 'noble' cause of war that may easily engage people, especially when the brainwashing starts in kindergartens and primary schools. \n\nIt is about supressing and dividing generations of people by creating existential fear. Thus becoming easy pray for the dynasty blood-line families and their controllers. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/iX13Dx-7Zko\nhttps://youtu.be/hr1hisvjoAI\nhttps://youtu.be/5rtRL0vvUBQ\nhttps://youtu.be/1uxJoOekxMI\nhttps://youtu.be/xasfYpvVMM0\n\nThese have systematically been suppressing advanced none-polluting quantum based energy technologies, first introduced by Nichola Tesla 100 years ago. Being eliminated from the history books, few are aware that he actually harnessed free energy from the air via an antenna, powering his electric car without need of charging. In doing so, he was breaking the fraudulent law of physics. \n\nBeing a grave threat to the establishment, like D. Rockefeller, and his company Standard Oil (now, ExxonMobil), Rotschild, JP Morgan, and so on, he had to be stopped. Since, humanity have been stuck to primitive, fossil fuel dependent technologies - all controlled by these. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/klXj198vY4A\nhttps://youtu.be/ecni9SjkWoM\nhttps://youtu.be/Nl5NW9KcMt0\n\n\"... we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States... If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\" \nDavid Rockefeller (1915-2017) \n\n\"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!\" \nMayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) \n\nClearly, the mere difference between conspiracy theory and reality is the awareness of the observer. \n\nOperating from the top of the power pyramid, they keep controlling science, financial, political, religious, educational, medical, civil, military and geopolitical institutions, as well as main stream media. Among those are the ones president Eisenhower, JFK and others warned about...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Gg-jvHynP9Y\nhttps://youtu.be/qvSD6If3zds\n\nAs a self-regulating living planetary entity Mother Earth would thrive tremendously with benign technological development. \n\nNow gullible and ignorant people are being brainwashed into ignoring the real dangers, namely pollution of our food, drinking water, air, rivers, seas, forests and land. Like the immune system attacking benign tissue in the case of auto-immune syndrome, the climate alarmists are led into attacking the social web of the global society. \n\nIn classrooms across the Western world, the plant food, a gas our collective human existence depend upon, which we exhale appr. 22 tons each annually, is currently being brainwashed into the minds of our children as being a pollutant, despite being a vital part of the photosynthesis that make our greens grow, thrive and produce fresh oxygen for us to survive in the polluted air. \n\nWe would have evolved past using fossil fuels long before nuclear fuel was invented. But since neither Rockefeller, Rotschild, JP Morgan, nor others could put a meter on Nicolas Tesla's quantum energy, abundantly and freely available, it had to be eliminated and buried before rooted in the society.\n\nA century later, seen from Tesla's perspective, we have not advanced. Quite contrary, a gullible child keep telling the world we got to return to medieval means of transport. \n\nWhile those in the know are simply demanding the release of the long kept forbidden technologies. Something like what a recently retired Air Force general talked about \"that can take us from one part of the planet to any other part within an hour.”\n\nhttps://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/31445/recently-retired-usaf-general-makes-eyebrow-raising-claims-about-advanced-space-technology\n\nThe future of non-pollutant energy does not come to us.

{"cid": "Ugxzry77KOEGjGjS95t4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

Through 2015, the average monthly September extent of Arctic sea ice has declined by 13.4 percent per decade relative to the average from 1981 to 2010. Declines are occurring in every geographic area, in every month, and every season. Natural variability and rising temperatures linked to global warming appear to have played a role in this decline. The Arctic may be ice-free in summer before the end of this century.\r\n\r\nAntarctic sea ice trends are smaller and more complex. Relative to the average from 1981 to 2010, the Antarctic sea ice extent increased about 1 percent per decade, but the trends were not consistent for all areas or all seasons. The variability in Antarctic sea ice patterns makes it harder for scientists to explain Antarctic sea ice trends and to predict how Southern Hemisphere sea ice may change as greenhouse gases continue to warm the Earth. Climate models do predict that Antarctic sea ice will respond more slowly than Arctic sea ice to warming, but as temperatures continue to rise, a long-term decline is expected.\" \nSource:  https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/search?q=sea+ice\n\n\nChris, first, you don't know me and it is inappropriate for you to call me names or apply labels to me.  That is uncalled for and hurtful.  Second, you started this post off by calling everyone \"liars\".  I don't know to whom specifically you were referring to, but the fact the Antarctic sea ice has increased is not new, and does not prove anything more than, what it says.  What I said is, \"net\" sea ice continues to decline (this includes both poles).  That is what NASA said (see quote above).  Your statement is factually correct, so I should not have said you were wrong, but your implication is that we are all \"lying\" about climate change, and that is incorrect. I hope this adequately clears things up for you.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "R.

And those facts say its a hoax. According to Al Gore every coastal city was supposed to be under 10 feet of water by 2012 and yet the sea level is the same now as it was 140 years ago. Keep talking but its still all conjecture and blatant lies. My original post says it all. If climate change is real and man is the cause which civilization caused the medieval warming period? The Vikings grew grapes and raised cattle in Greenland for 500 years but for the last 500 years thats been virtually impossible.  So if it was warmer then and it obviously wasnt man then who or what was it and if it wasnt men 1000 years ago why is it mans fault now.

Do you mean we should continue to put the unnecessary carbon tax on businesses so they become unsustainable and people loose their livelihood like the steal industry. They had to loan £120 million from the government, to pay the EU THEIR CARBON TAX, before they make a profit and pay wages. That business then became unsustainable as they were forced to put the price of the steel above market value in order to recover the £120 million. And so they couldn't secure any buyers because it' was too expensive and steel made China and India is far cheaper, they don't have carbon tax, just the countries of the Western world. Apparently the alleged climate change emergency only effects Western countries so come the end of the world they should be ok. Anyway, the owner moves back to Indian and continues making steel there. No carbon tax there, and no emergency and they are still building fossil fuel power station by the month! Carbon tax does not just effect steel and is an indirect tax on the people who want to buy anything. Just because it is not on the receipt when you purchase something does not mean that you are not paying it as an indirect tax, which the companies have to pay. It's just included in the purchase price. So everything becomes more expensive even your gas, electricity, and petrol. So the poorer people in society pay more tax. I am a believer in free market capitalism and even I think this is utter madness. The carbon tax is not even used in this country it is sent to the EU who use it for overseas projects. Great you may say but isn't that what the £13 billion a year overseas budget (taxpayers money) is used for? So what about helping the disadvantaged here? So what exactly do you mean by 'doesn't mean we should stop'? Making the poor poorer and transferring the money of the disadvantaged overseas? And by the way where is the taxpayers £120 million( taxpayers money), that was loaned to the steel company in the first place? I can't seem to find where that went, probably just evaporated into the climate change emergency! But someone is making money. \n\nThere is no climate emergency it's about tax, taking money from the people. It's all an utter fraud.

{"cid": "UgxqDAmemDAdMwzFb9x4AaABAg", "text": "Climate Change the Hoax\r\nIt's really simple, the Climate Change people are telling the world that the oceans are and have already risen. They show us a picture of some remote island that nobody has ever been to. But \"If\" the seas have already risen then why is the High Tide lines still in the same place they were a century ago? I'm talking about Florida, a place where we all have been or seen and know, and their beaches are well marked by sea walls and sand dunes, established lines and boundaries that prove the seas have not risen in the last century!\r\nSure the Leftists can find a small island that never dredged to rebuild their coastlines. In Florida we have been repairing our beaches with dredging for decades now. This is because for thousands of years there has been Storm Surge that decays the dunes, and the need to dredge is necessary for the tourist beach industry. Some places are losing top soil to the oceans because the inhabitants have stripped the land of trees & shrubs that used their roots to keep the ground from being washed away. This is not climate change, instead its negligence.\r\nClimate Change Fanatics have claimed that the problem has been going on for centuries and most recently are claiming ice melts sending \"Gazillions\" of gallons of water to the oceans have already caused the 'seas to rise.' Well Archimedes Law of Water Displacement means Florida's high tide lines should be over the roads by now but are not. Finding some small island that has never dredged nor protected their top soil is not proof of the seas rising. AND some claim that putting things in the oceans for the last thousand years may be the real cause of any minor evidence of water displacement evidence! When the Climate Change Fanatics can show me one 'major' beach that is being flooded by oceans rise then I will believe them. AND don't show me the pics of a \"King tide\" or moon tide that is caused by the alignment of the moon & sun periodically. That too is not evidence of climate change. The Leftists tried to portray some water in Miami washing over the sidewalks along Miami Beach as proof of climate change, when it was proved to be a moon tide only.\r\nHow despicable the Leftist Communists are to try and use \"The Sky is Falling\" or the Climate Change Hoax to further the cause of Socialism. They really are slavers with a desire to conquer the world like many others who have tried in history past. Now the new Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, Napoleon and Hitler is Global Communists using an army of alleged scientists to create mass hysteria. We will defeat them like we defeated all the armies of slavery before!\r\nThe use of science as a propaganda weapon was advanced by the Nazis in WW2 when they created scientific evidence against the Jews. After the US Civil War the Democrats rebuilt their party with the help of the College & University crowd that were touting the Missing Link Theory in Darwin's Evolution. That being blacks from the west coast of Africa were the missing link or half human and half monkey. It poured fuel on the hate in the Jim Crow era and was only removed by schools in the 1930s and 40's. The scientific community is for the most part civil servants and college funded people that cannot 'get rich' in their profession. So to theorize that they are a hate filled group who see some degree of power and authority with climate change is a reality. Hard to believe that even NASA scientists could be corrupted, but those without God no matter how intelligent they are at math and science harbor deceit and personal desires for wealth and power. Climate Change is allowing scientists to lay claim on the leadership of the world and that makes them dangerous. And global socialists are encouraging the science community to take a hard line with promises of more money.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Van Hellslinger", "channel": "UCt9ZYpWd07N9Biek3j5o4bw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTNba9j59zNWRzW0KbT1GwbmGzfwBcHxbaeu6n6Sw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxouluQ_s2dLzih9A14AaABAg", "text": "What would you do? Want to know why Jesus said the poor will always be with us? It's because separation of church and state is a lose-lose. Together, the state determines what the church says. Apart, God's law is separate from man's law. The only way they can be connected is with Jesus/God in the middle -  the King of Kings (Judah/King Line), Lord of Lords (Levi - Priest Line). He is the only person who has ever been worthy to sit on the throne, a leader who isn't above the law, but embodies it. Whose mercy sits above the law (Mercy seat above Ark of the Covenant/Law). That was the case, originally, when Lucifer coveted God's throne, got cast down, and caused us all to suffer through a world without God on the throne. We occupy a spiritually-dificient world where everyone is imperfect, lacking godly wisdom, and temptable. (2 Peter 3:7 \"The heaven and earth, WHICH ARE NOW...\" This isn't Noah's flood, you can't flood heaven, this referencing Lucifer's overthrow in Ezekiel). That's the lesson life is meant to teach us all - only God belongs on the throne (and you should be an advocate for that). The reason the American people \"do nothing\" is because most of them havent made it far enough in the biblical manuscripts to even know what TO do (or to realize history keeps repeating itself:  Follow God; thrive; fall away; suffer; beg for forgiveness, God takes us back; repeat). You can't eliminate a corrupt government unless you provide an alternative. The Bible says \"by wise counsel thy shalt make thy war, and in multitude of counsellors there is safety,\" and \"a companion of fools shall be destroyed.\" This nation isn't lead by a vast council of wise men, it is led by a handful of fools, and a divided collections of fools, at that. Blaming either side for being \"divisive,\" is ironic - the system ITSELF is divisive. We make no progress (although Trump has seemed to) because the two sides are too busy fighting over which foot first steps forward (or backwards, if you're on the left). I suppose a new council of wise men would suggest a return back to God's rule (such as before we cried for a King [Saul], thus began our slippery- slope), but Christ will return before that happens.

The output on one alone is incredible, and there is thousands as we speak, but with effort we can stop fracking, but then check out underground fires which all don't start from humans, nature had started one a thousand years ago and it's still burning, they are too costly to extinguish so some burn for decades others for centuries and one before Columbus set sail.   Now correct me when you do check in on it, I read that one underground fire can have more coal burning emissions than all of U.S.,.

Afterwards, the land remained vacant and was frequently used as illegal dumping grounds.[6][11][24][25][26] The former landfill became known as the Vandalia Dunes due to its sandy landscape, and became a habitat for the Henslow's sparrow and other bird species.[27][28] The area became the Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Area in 1967.[6][19] In 1989, the tract was acquired by Starrett Housing Corporation—the managers of Starrett City, which opened in 1974—for mixed-income housing construction.

It has been estimated that the melting of ice caps and glaciers with ocean water will cause an average increase of sea level by about a meter. Glaciers are early indicators of climate change, because widespread loss of glaciers could alter established climate patterns. For example, glaciers’ white surfaces that reflect sun rays helping to keep our current climate mild. When they melt, darker exposed surfaces absorb and release heat, raising temperatures. In Greenland, ocean circulation has been disrupted as icebergs brake off of glaciers, melting into the North Atlantic and decreasing density of the water. This phenomenon also decreases salinity, which can be extremely dangerous to ocean life.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Kiana Barrett", "channel": "UCZNwOlLky_-pm9WgUSlVD8g", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSpfndtWXoMsnjI5sF0_J50DSPmrvG0jqc3jA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

In the 1960s, Gore informed Hammer that zinc ore had been discovered near the Gore farm in Smith County, Tenn. Hammer, who owned Occidental Minerals (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum), bought the land for $160,000, twice the only other offer. But after buying the land, Hammer made a strange decision at least from a business standpoint. Rather than mine the zinc-rich land, he offered instead to let Gore buy it from him. Then, once ownership transferred to Gore, Occidental starting paying Gore $20,000 per year for the mineral rights to mine it. After the first payment, Gore Sr. sold the land to his son for $140,000. Gore has received a $20,000 check in the mail almost every year since.Perhaps even more astounding than Hammer’s decision to sell the land and pay royalties is that Occidental never actually mined the land. In 1985, Gore began leasing the land to Union Zinc, Inc., a competitor of Occidental. Gore still receives $20,000 a year in royalties. In all, the Hammer-engineered sweetheart deal has put hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits in Gore’s pocket.https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/how-the-gores-father-and-son-helped-their-patron-occidental-petroleum/", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Z M", "channel": "UCmMFXuksGwWu_Iox1ozsjqQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTwL3LeVAYWVi_xQHrVL_qWFTMAfb9D6tlzKA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Co2 has a specific gravity of 1.5 and air has a SG of 1.0, which means Co2 is heavier than air and does not rise up and create a heat trapping canopy, but falls down to the ground. Helium is lighter than air and it's why helium balloons float. Try filling a balloon with Co2 and see what happens, it will sink to the ground. Even if Co2 could float up and create a heat trapping canopy, which it can't, Co2 has been proven to not trap heat. The only experiment to see if Co2 trapped heat found that it did not trap heat or prevent heat from escaping the earth into outer space. This experiment was done by climate changers, hoping to prove that it did trap heat, but found out the opposite.

Since 1880 the earth's temperature has risen .3% (three TENTHS of a percent) -- which is amazingly stable. And, the fact is, humans have never had it this good!  Have you failed to notice that NONE of the \"global warming\" models they predicted have come true? So now they call it \"climate change\". Did you know it takes 30 years to define a \"climate\" -- and that climate ALWAYS changes? Do you really think man kind can measure the ENTIRE planet's temperature to a tenth of a degree, year after year and decade after decade, reliability? Of course not.  Do you think humans KNOW the optimal temperature of the earth?  Of course not. Do you know where these thermometers are placed and how many per continent? Because the temp readings are not evenly placed, or even close.  Did you know there's more ice in the south pole than ever? Did you know there's actually been no global warming for the last 18 years if you don't include the temperature of the ocean? Did you know that they didn't include the temperature of the oceans in their calculation except for the last 100 years (which is the only way they can say that global warming is occurring)?? If CO2 increased half as much since 1998 until now, as compared to the previous 100 years, then how come no global warming has occurred since? Did you know CO2 is better for crop yield -- so much so that farmers pump it into green houses? See -- they never talk about the positives -- only the doomsday scenarios.  Did you know that the raise in the sea level has been constant over the last 300 years (well BEFORE industrialization)?

Well thank God we had the power to warm it up! Millions of European people died of hunger, cold and war. Advancing glaciers were destroying villages in the Alps. The French Revolution was instigated by hunger! These were very hard times! The world is in a much better place now! We are producing more food than ever. More than a billion people have come out of poverty in the last few decades.

Also the Pyramids show water erosion dated back 12000 years ago which was way before the mainstream acceptance of when the pyramids were built which was about 3000 years ago. The water erosion date back to when the Sahara desert had water and rivers which changes everything. Idk I just dont believe in the mainstreams theory on when or who actually built the pyramids. I feel it might have been a prior civilization way before the pharaohs that we know of. That unknown civilization probably got wiped out due to a natural disaster, cataclysm like solar flares, flood etc who knows. You would never know due to structures eroding and deteriorating thousands of years later that there was probably an advanced civilization right in your own city you currently live in now. Its been said by plato that there has been multiple civilizations that have been wiped out and had to reset back to cavemen like plenty of times. Theres most likely been advanced civilizations like ours if not more advanced then us. We arent the first ones and we wont be the last. I mean look around. Theres pyramids all over the world. Thats not a coincidence. Back then I feel the whole world had communication with eachother. Might have been a global civilization. Maybe I could be wrong.

Yes, the climate changes. We once had an Ice Age on this planet. The planet once favored reptiles to thrive and grow to extreme sizes. The climate is always going to change on this planet and it's the organisms that can adapt to the changes that survive. Everyone who believes in this notion of global warming has also forgotten something we learned in elementary school. Most large, land dwelling organisms inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Most land dwelling plants absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. So, firstly, the source of the production of carbon dioxide does not affect the CO2 that is emitted. Carbon dioxide is still carbon dioxide whether I emit it or a gas powered car emits it. It, therefore, can not be harmful when emitted from the burning fossil fuels. Finally, if you observe greenhouses that inject carbon dioxide into the structure, you will see the recommended levels, measured in p.p.m., of carbon dioxide will exceed the current measured levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. So, if you believe that carbon dioxide is harmful to our environment, then you must be against all emissions of carbon dioxide, no matter the source. You must cease to exhale immediately. Our environment is dependent upon your cooperation!\nNow, I can only assume you are in a more urban setting than I. I base this on your profile name.

You say I'm wrong in the way I believe, then show me how I'm wrong. You wanna bring up that science has proven it is happening? I'll bring up the April 16, 1970 article published in The Boston Globe which stated we would be in an Ice Age by the beginning of the 21st century. That rhetoric continued until 1988 when, all of a sudden, the narrative switched to rising sea levels due to global warming. But scientists are always correct with their \"science-y\" stuff and numbers right? Yet, I don't need a parka to walk outside nor a boat to get to the store. Over the last 30 years, the \"global warming craze\" begin to lose traction. They thought, \"Oh, let's just relabel and repackage the same product and the people will eat it up.\" Well, it worked! But, they did finally find the correct term for this \"phenomenon of human intervention\" that has occurred since our planet came into existence. The climate has changed many times on our planet and guess what? There's \"science-y\" stuff to prove that too! So your favored scientist says one thing, and my favored scientist says the opposite. Both have \"facts\" to prove it. So, who's wrong then if scientists are the credible deciding factor? So, since we come to a stalemate at the scientists, we must use our own logical thinking to determine what we think is correct. I've stated in earlier comments that I base my conclusions on what we learned at a young age. We exhale CO2 and plants absorb it. Then in chemistry, you learn that an element is that element based upon the protons, neutrons, and electrons and the structure that they create. An element or compound then can not somehow change to be harmful in one scenario and the same compound then deemed safe in other scenarios. Therefore, carbon dioxide can not be harmful to our environment. If it was, the exhaling of trillions of organisms on earth would have caused significant damage to our atmosphere over the millions of years that these oxygen breathing organisms have existed. Yes, that does include humans. So, in conclusion, yet again, you have provided zero substance relative to the topic. You have actually done exactly what you just described in your last comment where you have tried to talk to even your own son, yet they refuse to be open to your opposing view. You instead took the cop out of, \"There's no point in arguing with someone who is convinced.\" I interpret your entire comment as YOU being the one who is \"set in your ways\" and unwilling to engage in civil dialogue because your \"facts\" are easily argued and hearing someone counter your argument triggers an emotional response that you do not have the will power to suppress. For example, I called you out for replying to everyone with no substance and pure belittlement. \"You uneducated willfully ignorant climate denier!\" Someone who can hear, or in this case to read, a statement that upsets or offends them, suppress their emotional response to the statement, and remain on topic shows a stronger will than the individual who allows that emotional response to control their actions. \n\nBy the way, I'm only 29 years old. Your son sounds like he needs someone whom he could relate to more than his dad. His own father is willing to throw him under the bus to a complete stranger so his father can put himself on a pedestal. That is quite discouraging. It's more discouraging, and frankly, pathetic, that I, a 29 year old father of two, is having to tell you how to speak and conduct yourself civilly, especially when referencing your own son.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Quentin Beckwith", "channel": "UCgA1um73ziDP-z2didvyy-A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTzEc5_7tY5bav6z3VFoa7nehMeIh7d-maLhA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Yes, people were talking about climate change 15 years ago. And we are now dealing with those impacts. The 1997 IPPC report predicted that rising temperatures threatened polar and Greenland's ice sheets. Today, glacial shifts and melting sheets have had tangible impacts. Maybe not to you and your neighborhood, but entire villages have been uprooted since their farms no longer can survive and their resources are being destroyed. Countless reports predicted decades ago that the rising level of CO2 and other pollutants threatened our air quality. Now, each year 8 million people die prematurely due to air pollution-related causes. The impacts are happening now. I can go on and on.

{"cid": "UgyAm6XyXtsf0xL0jHt4AaABAg.9-KPMZjRgE49-Kb2l-oClW", "text": " @Otter Pop     Humans being the cause of global warming can be proven as doubtful by multiple sources and events, which I've listed a few in the next paragraph. I also said that if you truly believe humans are causing climate change then you need to focus your attention on the countries causing the most damage... the same way you would focus your attention on water gushing from a pipe in the kitchen instead of focusing on a dripping pipe in the bathroom.... thus if you're still convinced humans are causing the climate change then turn your attention, protests to China, India and Brazil.\r\nWhy climate change caused by humans is doubtful:\r\n1. First the obvious flawed behaviors and actions of those pushing the climate change being caused by humans theory:\r\nA) Look at the history of climate change predictions during the last 40 years. You will see as the scientists have been repeatedly wrong many many many times yet the schools, government and news media continue to ignore when they've been wrong. This doesn't seem strange to you???\r\nB) As time keeps passing the climate change scientists keep pushing out their predictions further and further into the future(go check), since they've had such a high percentage of failed predictions. Plenty of their predictions today are 20, 30, 50 or 100 years in the future now. The scientists simply are not held accountable for cherry picking data or being wrong about predictions... unlike most careers where people are held accountable for their work.\r\nC) FACTS show if human climate change is real the main pollution issues exist within China, India and Brazil. Yet the majority of politicians, schools, scientists and news media only talk about changes which must be made in the civilized countries??? And the reason... is because they want you and they want businesses to spend more money. Look how the carbon tax in France caused people to riot in the streets because even the climate change believers in France knew it wasn't a France issue! The fact the politicians are pushing increased taxes from the more civilized innocent countries increases doubt on climate change. If climate change was real the politicians such as Obama would have been placing tariffs on China instead today he's recently bought beach front property plus he has two other homes!!\r\nD) Look at the climate change conferences in Italy and Switzerland... if climate change was a very serious issue why did so many people use separate private jets which adds huge amounts of air pollution??? They don't even try sharing a private jet for their flights! Proof these elite only want to push changes on the working class.\r\nE) You will never see the schools, politicians and news media talking with top scientists who disagree with climate change.... it's all one-sided. Can you imagine if our court cases only had a prosecuting attorney where people had no defense??    This is proof of corruption.\r\n\n\n2. Now for the science on why climate change from humans is doubtful:\r\nA) There's many top scientists who disagree humans are causing climate change which include a Nobel Prize winning scientist! Please take some time to learn their side of this issue... some of those scientists have reported the corruption of climate change scientists.\r\nB) There's plenty of stories all around the world regarding climate change scientists which have either manipulated data OR cherry picked their data for pushing their climate change agenda. Even NOAA was caught manipulating data. Please research the history of these events because *these are only the known cases*... who knows how many were not caught.\r  WHY would they even need to manipulate data.... unless it's not true.\nC) Mars has almost lost its ice caps and this nearby planet has *no humans*, almost no atmosphere, almost no terrain, and almost no life. \r\nD) Remember the stories about the polar bears being in danger due to climate change... oh wait there population has increased yet the news media hides this truth!\n\r\nPlease spend 5 minutes researching these truths and then ask for links regarding anything you could not locate. And whatever path you choose remember China, India and Brazil have been proven for causing the greatest amounts of air, land and ocean pollution so even if you choose to think humans are responsible you know where to focus your attention.\r\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76LjhfI5ZaI", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Alan Pior", "channel": "UCAodc64VhqW2U7PBebv4S4A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTp5pwF1d-mENLawoBWxyj3w_BSozZb3uOX_UEN=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Not too sure what this has to do with this larger discussion. As a physics major I have a pretty quality understanding of when gas laws are applicable. Ideal gas laws apply to ideal gases. Ideal gases are hypothetical. End of discussion. Yes,  CO2 concentrations were historically higher. We were not alive then and wouldn't have survived because those were not survivable conditions for people. No scientist is concerned about the concentration alone. The rapid rate at which CO2 is being emitted is a much larger problem with dire consequences.

But, as I said, it is getting greener.  Coal is down from its peak of around 50% to now around 25%, and continuing to fall.  Natural gas (which releases around half the carbon of coal) has been increasing, but is starting to plateau.  Nuclear has been steady at around 20% for a long time.  Hydro is steady.  Wind and solar are increasing, and represent the majority of new power generation.  That's very significant.  I'm not sure why you dismiss it.\n\n\"There isn't enough sunlight or wind to generate the electrical energy we need now, much less what we would need if everyone drove electric cars.\"\n\nThere's plenty, and their eventual takeover is an economic certainty since wind and solar are getting cheaper and cheaper while fossil fuels are not.  This is especially true for solar, which can take advantage of mass production efficiencies similar to what computer chips cheaper and cheaper.\n\n\"Do you understand how efficient it is to carry energy around in the form of liquid gasoline?  The amount of battery space/weight/cost to replace a 400 mile tank of gas is LUDICROUS!!!\"\n\nI understand perfectly.  Batteries are much heavier than a tank full of gasoline.  However, an electric motor and simple single speed gear reduction transmission are way lighter than an equivalent gasoline or diesel engine and multi-speed transmission.  A battery doesn't store as much energy, but an electric motor is way more efficient than a gasoline engine at turning that energy into motion.  The end result is that overall a 300+ mile EV is only marginally heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle (a Tesla Model 3 weighs 3800 lbs.  A BMW 335i weighs 3500 lbs).  Batteries are dropping in price and getting more dense every year, so the issues of cost and weight, will disappear before too long, making practical 400+ mile range for those who need it.\n\n\"Do you know how environmentally unfriendly it is to mine Lithium?\"\n\nAll resource extraction causes environmental damage.  There's nothing particularly unique about lithium.  At least lithium is put into durable goods that last years, not consumed once and then gone.\n\n\"Burning coal and natural gas to release CO2 is NOT HARMFUL.  [...]  It has no effect on climate.\" \n\nAn assertion without evidence and contrary to the scientific consensus.  At the very least, you have to acknowledge that you cannot say with 100% confidence that there is absolutely no risk.  Nobody can.  If there is risk, and the cost to reduce risk is small, it makes sense to do it.\n\n\"China and India are building 20 new coal plants for every one we retire.\n\nCO2 is not air pollution.  Our coal plants do not pollute the air.\"\n\nThose countries are dichotomies.  They are making huge strides in renewable energy, while continuing to build polluting coal plants.  But their use of coal is nothing we want to emulate.  They are killing their own people by the thousands with air pollution from vehicles and coal power plants.  I was in China a few years ago, and the pollution is truly awful.  Our coal plants are cleaner, but all coal plants emit air pollution (not just CO2), and generate huge amounts of coal ash.

It is not a greenhouse and CO2 contributes nothing to the warmth of the planet.  That is purely a function of energy input from the sun and the galaxy at large.  We radiate into space the same way we receive it from space.  We are naked to the universe here on earth.  We have no container to insulate the surface from the cold of deep space.\nThere is nothing to support that CO2 rising is bad for the planet.  On the contrary, as CO2 has risen, crop yields per acre have steadily risen.  More people fed than ever before.  Higher standards of living, lower death rates, fewer diseases . . . \n\nNo coastal inundation.  The Maldives still host tourists.  Obama just spent 15 million dollars on a new beachfront home.\nThey don't believe the climate change BS.

{"cid": "Ugwe6SctpvjDs8OKHmh4AaABAg", "text": "Sorry UN, saying it's so doesn't make it so.\n\nThose who use the term \"climate change\" are really using it as a shorthand for Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW). There is no sense in which CAGW is real.\n\n1) There is no statistically significant measurable rise in the average global temperature in the last 20 years despite the increase in CO2. Some localities actually show a decrease. We're definitely not seeing unprecedented temperature highs, increased storm activity or any other predicted effects of global warming. Hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, etc. are all down in recent years compared to the past, not up. Stations that are unambiguously warming are almost invariably doing so due to the urban heat island effect or other siting issue, not any global cause.\n\n2) The measurable rise in the average global temperature between 1970 and 2000 still did not rise as high as the average global temperature in the 1930s. There was enough of a global cooling between 1940 and 1970 that it scared scientists enough to declare the possibility that we might be entering another ice age. We still haven't fully recovered to the temperatures of the \"Grapes of Wrath\" Dust Bowl era that caused the only known climate refugee migration in recorded history since the Norse abandoned Greenland. I'm not yet seeing Midwest farmers abandoning their farms in droves and moving to California in 2019.\n\n3) Even the 1930s was only a local maximum in the average global temperature. We've had warmer periods in recorded history, and warmer periods in prehistory for which we can find reliable evidence in surrogates. (Ice core measurements of CO2, by the way, are not reliable and understate the variability and absolute amount of CO2 at the time of ice formation.)\n\n4) The demise of Arctic sea ice has been repeatedly predicted and yet it still remains extant long after the predicted dates for its demise and the Arctic is still almost entirely closed to commercial sea traffic. Similar hysteria has been drummed up over land ice in Antarctica and Greenland, yet their ice remains as well. It's simply not true that we're losing anomalous amounts of polar ice in any of these regions, let alone all three (which would be required of any \"global\" phenomenon). It also needs to be noted that sea ice cannot cause sea level rise, only land ice can do that.\n\n5) NASA, NOAA and other bodies have been caught altering their data to introduce the very trends they are supposedly trying to detect. Such alterations are unscientific and need to be rejected. When they don't bother to alter the data, they begin their graphs at the last low in the measurements: the 1970s. This is cherry picking and needs to be called out.\n\n6) The IPCC models are demonstrably wrong. Continued use of them is unscientific. They need to be rejected. The vicious cycle positive feedback mechanism that they depend on for their catastrophic predictions simply does not exist. CO2 rises follow temperature rises, thus they cannot initiate temperature rises. The IPCC knows this, they claim that CO2 rise exacerbates and prolongs a temperature rise. If the feedback cycle actually existed as the IPCC says, then past known global heat waves would not have stopped and we'd not be here. This planet would already be another Venus.\n\n7) The greenhouse gas theory upon which the IPCC models rest is unproven. There is an alternative (better) scientific theory that says it cannot be true. It's a well-known physics law (ideal gas law) that says gas temperature rises with pressure. If we compute how much temperature rise can be expected at the earth's surface due to gravity-induced pressure, there is no need for the greenhouse theory. All the temperature rise can be accounted for by atmospheric pressure, leaving none for the greenhouse theory. The ideal gas law can be used to account for the anomalous heat at the surface of Venus as well as the surface of the earth, this despite the fact that Venus's greenhouse gases are orders of magnitude greater than earth's.\n\n8) Even if the greenhouse theory is true, according to the theory the climate is only logarithmically sensitive to CO2. In other words, if it could be proven that average global temperature rose 1 degree Celsius exclusively because of a CO2 doubling from 200 ppmv to 400 ppmv, then it would take another doubling from 400 ppmv to 800 ppmv to produce the next 1 degree Celsius rise. Thus we can safely double CO2 from slightly more than 400 ppmv at present to 800 ppmv by 2100 and still only be in danger of a 1 degree Celsius rise by then, which would by no means be catastrophic. It would not be enough to cause large amounts of polar land ice to melt and create any noticeable rise in sea levels. It would actually be beneficial to plant growth in most populated regions of the world, thus increasing food supply for both humans and animals.\n\n9) Increased CO2 itself is beneficial to plant life. We've already seen (via satellite imagery) that the planet is greening and deserts are growing smaller. Real greenhouses deliberately triple the CO2 inside them (raise internal air from 400 ppmv CO2 to 1200 ppmv) so the plants breathe much easier and expire less water vapor, thus cutting down on the amount of water they need to thrive. The last thing we should ever allow leftists to do would be to sequester atmospheric CO2.\n\n10) Scientists measure atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa, which everyone agrees is as accurate as modern technology will allow. But they cannot and do not measure the human contribution to atmospheric CO2. The IPCC was chartered only to consider human contributions to climate change, thus, they deliberately mislead people into thinking that the entire CO2 rise is due to human activity when that is certainly not true. We know that the oceans release CO2 when they warm, and that effect is about 16 times more powerful than anything we puny humans can collectively muster. Certain isotopes are assumed to be due to human activity, but there is no proof of that, it's merely an assumption. The IPCC also assumes that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for much longer periods than is likely to be the case. There are very good scientific reasons to think that the anthropogenic portion of the greenhouse gases has been vastly exaggerated in the public mind, and natural origins have been downplayed. Note also that CO2 is not the only or even the primary greenhouse gas. According to the theory, most of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor and clouds, not CO2, yet nobody is at all upset about the water vapor we humans emit.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "dlwatib", "channel": "UCd8b9zfylMSIkpEpZgrY7-g", "votes": "9", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRfXTPgiuE-MLEmOlLF9ROqOZdYEneb5WNN8zle=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Basic math, 17 percent of 3 to 5 percent of 400 is 2.4 molecules of CO2 to 3.04 molecules of CO2 per million molecules of air.   I would note also that I have never seen that percentage calculated except in 100 percent DRY air.   That means absolutely no water vapor is present in the test sample.   In most places over the surface of the planet there is water vapor in the air.   It is true that there are some some places where water vapor is not present but you wouldn't want to live there.   So, back to America, even at 2.4 to 3.04 CO2's per million, the U.S. could become totally carbon neutral and have no affect on the CO2 level of the planet.    India and China are making sure of that.    They were both given \"exemptions\" to CO2 emission limits in the Paris climate accords.

Accordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Corney from his position.\"479 In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to review Corney's performance and that Rosenstein decided \"on his own\" to come to the President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Corney. When a reporter indicated that the \"vast majority\" of FBI agents supported Corney, Sanders said, \"Look, we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.\"48° Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments.481 Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from \"countless members of the FBI\" was a \"slip of the tongue.\"482 She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Corney was a comment she made \"in the heat of the moment\" that was not founded on anything.483  Sec 1 p. 72 M. report.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "NEAR TERM EXTINCTION - HUMAN", "channel": "UCE_qfPI4wlwCQvfDih6C0Zg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQJLBNQ1WiEMX2W7SOwJcNANjCKFa0OHKIJvCNT=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Many others in their reports where taken out of context.  Later many of those same scientists stated they did not support the theory of \"Global Whaaa Whaaa\". The media has kept this quiet on purpose.\n\n\nThose scientists that stick by Global Whaa Whaa have only computer models on which to estimate CO2 increases. They did not have ways to measure atmospheric CO2 135 years ago. Nor did the Egyptians. LOL\nI can look up at the night sky and see a star and estimate the distance, but most likely i would be WAY wrong.\nScientists know that the earth goes through cycles of \"climate change\". The last ice age was not that long ago.  We have been in a cycle of warming for awhile. This is a normal cycle albeit humans have done little to add to this overall.\nIt is funny how the Global Whaaa Whaaa cultists have adopted terms when the model of Global Whaaa Whaaa does not fit. For instance when its to hot, its Global Whaaa Whaaa. When its colder than normal or when temperatures drop and don't fit the predictions, then it's \"climate change\". They have added this term to their long slurry of terms to enact fear into people who are not scientists or thinkers.\nWhy you ask? It's about control, they want everyone to think the sky is falling so they will give up their freedoms for safety at any cost.\nThe Democrats started this agenda decades ago. They were really Socialists in hiding. If you have not noticed they are not in hiding anymore. When Al Gore said that the earth would end in 1995. That came to pass, nothing that he stated would happen came to pass. When asked why we are all still alive he is silent... But still believes in the bovine scatology. He is a fool with a fool's agenda.\nYou keep posting the same report and base you whole thoughts on just one report from 1979. Its outdated as we know more about the earth than we did back then some 40 years ago. We have better equipment and better technology. \nSocialists want us to be slaves this is why they are using Global Whaaa Whaaa and many other narratives.

Socialism is a canard, a talking point, name calling.  \n\nThe models are wrong is another canard.  \n\nModels are drawn as best they can be done.   We have no other choice when predictions are based on today's fact.  It is our only tool.  In 1979 the best guess for national security of when a crisis might be reached because of CO2 was the first half of this century.   Also, predicted at that time was \"too late\".   Now, as a matter of fact, the \"too late\" has children by the millions in the streets protesting.   The models have proven as good as reasonable.  80 percent of the insects are gone.  Anyone our age can see.   The latent heat of ice is about 144 btu / pound.  Anyone can look at the arctic sea ice charts & connect it with the nightly news.   \n\nI don't care the whole species goes extinct.  I care only the fossil-fueled civilization continue as my life depends on it.  We all depend on it to maintain a global system where they lock up the food, also maintaining 450 atomic boilers, the 1000 dirty bomb Japan tank farm, the global cooling from all the burning activity of 7 billion of the odd, naked-ape species.  \n\nI still don't understand about the 97 percent thing, what you are trying to say, but it don't matter.  Anyone who has made an effort to learn the facts of our population over-shoot & peak oil knows there has been a program of manufacturing doubt.   Lord Monkton shows both the desperation keep things going & the poor quality of the public understanding.   \n\nWhat is to be done is now is in the hands of a global movement.   The optics are not good for The State with military equip police facing children & families in a showdown.  Our reality is pretty clear.  We are already extinct & we are trapped into bringing it on as fast as possible.

If it was just one or two fossils found then you could make that argument. I wouldn't be surprised to hear sea creatures were found on Everest. To explain it well I have to discuss some principles of plate tectonics. The Indian-Austrialian plate is mostly underneath the ocean. As magma rises from underwater volcanoes, it forms new crust and makes the old crust slide outward away from the emersion point. This process will force \"old\" crust to be pushed until they hit a different plate and then you have a conversion boundary.

Of those, 300,000 or so identify themselves as climate scientists. You keep referencing this 'consensus'. Can you direct me to the database where all of these people weighed in?\n\n\nAlso, here's temperature over the last 10,000 years: https://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/lappi/gisp-last-10000-new-a.gif\n\n\nCurrent times are on the far right. Please note, the 29 peaks proceeding that point above our current levels. Please also note the lowest lows of many of those periods are also higher than our current temperatures. Notice how the 'rate of warming' is also comparable to any other spike. Last but not least, also note how the warm peaks coincide with golden ages of historical human civilization. \n\n\nYour heart is in a good place, I get it. But you really need to stop reading into the hype. If you want to make a case for not throwing so much trash all over the place and driving species into predation,  we'd probably find a lot of common ground. But AGW is largely a political issue supported by theoretical prediction models that have NEVER lined up with the observable data. Not even one time in more than 50 years of these doomsday predictions. If something wants to be a 'fact', it has do be demonstrable through experimentation with predictable results.

You probably just read the 2 first paragraphs of that  first Nasa article, because it says at the end: \n'The temperature change of the current's water is part of a known climate pattern, one that is expected to flip again, and cause more of the melting and ice thinning for which Jakobshavn is known. Although the melting rate has slowed, the glacier continues to contribute to sea level rise, ultimately losing more ice to the ocean than it gains from snow accumulation overall.'\n\n\nFor the 2nd article: \n“Our findings don’t mean that Antarctica is growing; it’s still losing mass, even with the extra snowfall.”\n\n\nAnd \n\n\n“What it means, however, is that without these gains, we would have experienced \"even more\" sea level rise in the 20th century.” \n\n\nFinally\n\n\n“Snowfall plays a critical role in Antarctic mass balance and it will continue to do so in the future,” Medley said. “Currently it is helping mitigate ice losses, but it’s not entirely compensating for them. We expect snowfall will continue to increase into the 21st century and beyond, but our results show that future increases in snowfall cannot keep pace with oceanic-driven ice losses in Antarctica.”\n\n\nNice try.\n\n\nFor all you deniers, here are some trustworthy scientific links that maybe can change your mind if you're not close-minded.
