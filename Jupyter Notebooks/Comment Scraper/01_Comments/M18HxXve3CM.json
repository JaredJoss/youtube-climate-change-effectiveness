{"cid": "UgwKgqd5P6ZpxL4aBfx4AaABAg", "text": "According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years.  That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to \"fight\" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.  The following is the source of this information:\n\nHistorical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core\n\nInvestigators\nJ.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius\nLaboratoire de Glaciologie et de G√©ophysique de l'Environnement,\nCNRS, BP96,\n38402 Saint Martin d'Heres Cedex, France\n\nN.I. Barkov\nArctic and Antarctic Research Institute,\nBeringa Street 38, 199397,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia\n\nPeriod of Record\n417,160 - 2,342 years BP\n\nMethods\nIn January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15¬∞C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the \"Grenoble analytical setup,\" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).\n\nTrends\nThere is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.\n\nReferences\nBarnola, J.-M., D.

For example the Kula Ring a whale feeds entire villages and the meat is readily trade able for other things.

Ultimately there needs to be an effort to debunk the medicinal value of it, or at the very least find an alternative that is just as effective without killing whales. its a bit harder to get armed guards following around a whale b/c you'd need shifts of scuba-divers or submarines. which would be costly.

One way of staying involved in government for me has been through signing petitions. Recently a petition for saving 8 beluga whales from being captured for a marine aquarium in the united states was posted. I always think about what it is I am signing, and I thought to myself, \"Well it is 8 so that would make a pod, that way they aren't lonely. And as a kid going to an aquarium, that actually caused me to care about those creatures out in the wild. So I won't sign, because it seems like it's ultimately for a good cause. The kids that see those belugas will want to save them, or have an opportunity to care- rather than never seeing them and therefore not really caring if they all die off in the wild.\" However, if as you say whales are usually picked out from pods, that would cause a lot of distress, and that causes me to reconsider signing that petition. Perhaps it would be better for a group to start a breeding program for whales and dolphins etc. for aquariums, preferably from ones that are already in aquariums, so that new generations can be taken from there rather than the wild. That way, pods will not be broken up, mothers will not lose their children, and wild whales can continue to propagate- which is exactly what is needed. And in the meantime, new generations of children will grow up with \"cool experiences\" of animals they saw on the other side of the glass, and care about protecting the ones that are out in the wild.

Id need to look more into the situation but im not for keeping whales in an aquarium in most circumstance. My understanding is Their dorsal fins end up collapsing after being in a tank for long periods of time. You just cant mimic the same conditions as the ocean. Confinement is still stressful to them regardless of being with their pod or not. being confined to a small area could make them irritable, look at prisons for instance. the truth is no killer whale has ever killed a human in the wild but in captivity there have been plenty of fatalities. They need a varied diet not just fish which is fairly common with aquariums they deserve the peace and quiet away from humans on a constant basis. Only circumstance would be if they are injured and incapable of returning to the wild or they are trying to prevent them from going extinct. There arent enough as it is in the wild, and it certainly doesnt help the ecosystem with them in a tank. Ultimately there are other alternatives to educating people on the importance of stewardship of the environment. A TV show where they can see them in their own habitat would be a better alternative. I have never been to an aquarium with whales, but still have come to understand their plight without the need of seeing them up close and as much as i want to see them in person I dont.

There is a maximum weight limit to how much biomass any ecosystem can support. ¬†Our population takes a large percentage of this biomass. Surprisingly the insects and especially the ants take a higher percentage than we do..\nMy other opinion is we are also caretakers of nature and deserve to be recognized for that. ¬†Would another organism that reaches our height grow as many flower gardens, or set out as many bird feeders as we do? ¬† We can't answer this but the idea that we don't know how we compare gives weight to placing a positive tag on our abilities as much as a negative. ¬†One thing that gets overlooked in all this is that Where humans live you will always find trees being grown. ¬†The forests have thinned but they cover more land as we have spread out.¬†", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "Darren Pellichino", "channel": "UC9ZQSq8SAuWfOGlaun8pUbw", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTU0kAsq99Lqnvh13_cJS0OrZEtDI7UI7woM_BcOg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}
