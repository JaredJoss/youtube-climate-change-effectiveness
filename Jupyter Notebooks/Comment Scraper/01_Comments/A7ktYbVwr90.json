My first point where I radically differ from you is regarding the (minor) role of CO2 as a greenhouse gas and my second point is that you do not take in account the eminent role of the water vapor feed-back, which is crucial in all the IPCC models to justify the projected potentially extremely high temperature increases till end of the century of up to 4.5 degrees C and higher. Regarding the role of CO2 for the Climate Change S.I. Rasool and S.H. Schneider (the later co-founder of IPCC), both from NASA GISS, created with a 1971 groundbreaking SCIENCE Article the base of all IPCC models. They stated: \" A doubling of CO2 produces a tropospheric temperature change of 0.8 K (or 0.8 degrees C). However as more CO2 is added to the atmosphere the rate of temperature increase is proportionally less and less and the increase eventually levels off. Even for an increase in CO2 by a factor of 10 (!), the temperature increase does not exceed 2.5 K (or 2.5 degrees C). Therefore, the runaway greenhouse effect does not occur because the 15 Œºm CO2 band, which is the main source of absorption, saturates.\" This NASA Report was later confirmed by 40 years satellite and 70 years of weather balloon temperature measurements. We should therefore relax and enjoy the advantages of higher CO2 concentrations of more than 400 ppm, as is the greening of the planet which already measurably helps to improve the food production and greens the Sahel. More vegetation is also essential for the functioning of the hydrological cycles and the above-mentioned water vapor feed-back is part of these cycles. The hydrological cycles govern up to 95% of the earth heat dynamics and energy fluxes. These are self-organizing interconnected systems stabilizing the climate since 4.5 billion years despite dramatically changing CO2 concentrations in Earth‚Äôs history from 100 ppm to 10.000 ppm. The water vapor feed-back is usually explained the following way: The increase of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere causes a certain small temperature increase. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which is the most important greenhouse gas, and this water vapor causes again an additional warming of the atmosphere. But it is essential to mention and almost always forgotten, that this increased concentration of water vapor condenses to clouds, which then reflect up to 90% of the incoming solar radiation back to space. As the 15- Œºm absorption band is more and more saturated the greenhouse effect of the CO2 is levelling off and I suppose that the negative cloud feed-back already begins to dominate the positive water vapor feed-back and the net effect will be a cooling. Taking this into account the greenhouse effect of doubling of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which will be reached probably end of the century, is not more than 1.2 ‚Äì 1.5 degrees C. This temperature increase would be only beneficial ‚Äì remember that in 1850 we came out of the Little Ice Age and the temperatures have not yet reached the optimal temperature of the Holocene of 15-degree C. During the Holocene Optimum 9800 until 5800 years before our time the average temperatures on the Northern Hemisphere were about 1-5 degrees C warmer than today, the Earth biosphere was flourishing, and the Humans started the first High Civilizations. I suppose the North Pole was ice free during these 4000 (!) years and the permafrost thawed completely in the Tundra. The mentioned complex processes of the hydrological cycles are utterly impossible to model. The IPCC climate scientists try therefore since 1980 in vain to lower the prohibitive high uncertainty range of 1.5. to 4.5 degrees C for a doubling of CO2. All simulated projections of temperature by the IPCC models showed a heavily exaggerated warming. About twice as much as measured by 40 years of satellite and 70 years of weather balloon measurements. All models would have to be considered falsified, if real Science would be applied. The sea level rise depends to 50% on the ocean expansion caused by the warming of the atmosphere. To my understanding, this warming is impossible to foresee based on the IPCC models.

{"cid": "UgzegckhHxdqPNDSAwN4AaABAg", "text": "Is climate change real or false? forget all the scientists and there graphs and figures, just deal with basic physics.\n\nThe answer lies in two simple laws of physics.\n\nPhysic law one)  \n\nIt is physically impossible to endlessly put something into something that is not endless.   Regardless of the size of the limited space there is no exception to this law, if it is a limited space then you cannot endlessly put something into it.\n\nIf that limited space as a ecosystem that relies on balance then every species in it must be kept to a acceptable number that, that ecosystem can naturally support.\n\nBut that is not what the human species wants to do,  it wants to put an endless amount of people into this limited space and claims it will not damage or upset the natural balance of this limited space. This is because it cannot deal with  population control,  it doesn't have the emotional ability or the intelligence to discuss such a subject . It is why it is living in denial. \n\n Physics law two)\n\nIt is physically impossible for a stationary object to keep up with something that is constantly moving.  No matter how far a head you put the stationary object of the thing that is moving it will always catch it up and leave it behind.\nNow you can always keep moving the stationary object ahead of the thing that's moving, but to do so you will have to have endless space, if you don't have endless space then you are going to come unstuck.\n\nThis should tell you,  it doesn't matter how many homes you build you will never build enough, because the problem will keep coming back as the population keeps growing.\n\n The quicker the population grows the quicker the problem comes back, so building homes is not the answer.\n\nThe answer is to stop the thing that is moving and keep it level with the stationary object then you have solved the problem for ever until the end of time. \n\n So if you control the human population and keep it at a sensible level that each landmass can naturally support,  then you don't have problems because you are keeping the human species in balance with its environment. \n\nThese two laws show you that climate change is real because you have a species just mindlessly endlessly multiplying into a space that is not endless, there can only be one outcome from this behaviour. And it is not a good one .\n\nIf anybody thinks I am wrong then I challenge you to prove me wrong,  get a limited space like a cup, then show me how you can endlessly pour water into it without it ever overflowing.

Esos 2 grados a los que el sistema clim√°tico entrar√≠a en zona roja es alarmismo social, bien estructurado y hecho religi√≥n, no se puede rebatir. Pero la realidad es que si la temperatura de la tierra subiera esos 2 grados, o incluso 5 o 6 grados celsius el entorno biol√≥gico ser√≠a much√≠simo m√°s √≥ptimo de lo que lo es ahora. En cuanto al Co2 y la siempre machacona idea de que provoca efecto invernadero capaz de alterar el clima y por lo tanto hay que anular sus emisiones se trata de otra gran mentira inventada por el equipo de pseudo cient√≠ficos que conforman el fraudulento Ipcc. En el conocido \"√≥ptimo medieval\" sucedido entre los siglos 10 y 14 de nuestra era los niveles de Co2 fueron casi 14 veces mayores que los actuales y que tanto miedo causan a los calent√≥logos alarmistas y genocidas. Eliminar el Co2 ser√≠a el mayor cr√≠men contra la vida perpetrado nunca en el planeta. Por lo tanto: error. Tambi√©n en ese per√≠odo medieval la temperatura global del planeta estaba 6 o 7 grados por encima, y ni nadie se muri√≥ por ello, ni el planeta revent√≥ en mil pedazos como se sigue argumentando falsamente desde los postulados de la Onu y el Ipcc. Todo esto se podr√≠a poner en duda si las circunstancias fueran otras, pero ver c√≥mo se ha apartado del debate clim√°tico a miles de cient√≠ficos que basan sus conclusiones en el seguimiento del m√©todo cient√≠fico (que por otro lado es el que se debe seguir para resultar m√≠nimamente riguroso) hace levantar serias sospechas de que todo este tinglado clim√°tico no tiene m√°s objetivo que el de debilitar la econom√≠a de los pa√≠ses, empobrecer m√°s a los pa√≠ses tercermundistas, haci√©ndoles carecer de electricidad e impidiendo la industrializaci√≥n de sus pa√≠ses e imponer una nueva forma de totalitarismo mundial bajo el mando de un gobierno √∫nico basado en el enriquecimiento y la dominaci√≥n del resto de la poblaci√≥n.

Then he proceeds to give a presentation without any factual backing, just making claims... like someone who find the effort to actually learn details about the science \"too dreary\".  He could have talked about the predictive capability of the climate models (or lack of), or the fact that CO2's warming potential falls off rapidly as more is added to the atmosphere since it only absorb a narrow band of the IR radiation wave spectrum and by about 200ppm has absorbed about all it can absorb, or the fact that the models completely ignore the impact  of clouds and areosols.  He didn't mention the 0.8C of warming began as the earth was coming out of a period of natural cooling (the Little Ice Age), and the definition of \"coming out of a cooling period\" would imply warming... and that that warming began naturally before any consumption of fossil fuels.  He could have mentioned that between 12000 and 7000 years ago sea levels rose 400 feet which all happened naturally... but over the lat 200 years sea levels have only risen about 13.5 inches (2mm per year which is about 1/12 of an inch).  So 400 feet by nature, but  that extreme and catastrophic 13.6 inches is man made... yea that makes sense.

{"cid": "UgxhVoa-kmyzExNMpmJ4AaABAg.8oRSKCg9VyL8pFDp3V80ij", "text": "The Earth is not warming because of human CO2 emissions. This may surprise you, but you already know this. No, you don't have to be a climatologist with a string of letters after your name. All you need is to know a little basic history and not live in the tropics. There are two basic lies being put about. The hockey stick graph from Michael Mann and the overstating of the greenhouse effect of CO2 by the media.\n\nMichael Mann from the IPCC produced a graph of the average temperature of the Earth over the last 1,000 years. This graph shows virtually no change in global temperatures from 1,000 years ago to the start of the industrial revolution at which point, driven by human CO2 emissions, it shoots up by, wait for it, an astronomic zero point eight degrees. In case you are wondering why anyone took this seriously, the entire Y axis he used was only about 1.5 degrees which made the 0.8 degree rise look huge and the media, always keen to¬†jump on a good scare story, ignored the scale. The real problem with his graph, however, is the assertion that the temperature remained constant prior to the industrial revolution. You know that just isn't true. In the tenth century, the Vikings, led by Erik the Red, settled and farmed in Greenland. It was much warmer then. When the Earth cooled some 4 to 5 hundred years later they had to leave. By 1600, the Earth was in the grip of a mini ice age. Seas around Britain's shores froze, and there were regular winter fairs held on the frozen river Thames. George the 2nd then enjoyed a considerable warming period, almost back to today's level. However, by the time Charles Dickens wrote Scrooge and A Christmas Carol the temperature had again dropped and white Christmases were the norm. None of this is the stuff of legend. It is all well documented.¬†The Michael Mann graph is just plain wrong, and, at no time during these changes was there any significant change in sea level.\n\nThe second lie is that the Earth is kept warm by the greenhouse effect of CO2. This is nonsense and, provided you don't live in the tropics, you know this too. Go outside on a winter night when it's cloudy and it's quite warm. Go outside when it's a clear starry night and it's cold. I'm not talking about 0.8 degrees here. There is a difference of 6 to 10 degrees. The greenhouse effect is caused by clouds. Yes, CO2 does have greenhouse properties but consider this, the concentration of CO2 in the air is a balance between what is emitted by us and volcanoes and¬† what is absorbed by plants, the oceans and crustaceans. On a weekday, our power stations work at full capacity, belching CO2, to run our factories, belching CO2, and 100,000 trucks thunder up and down motorways also belching CO2. At weekends the factories close and the truck drivers go fishing. The plants oceans and crustaceans don't have weekends off so by Sunday night the CO2 concentration is less than it was on Friday night. Now compare the temperature on a cold starry Friday night with the temperature on a cold starry Sunday night. Feel the difference? Of course not. Now we really are talking about a fraction of a degree. The greenhouse effect of CO2 is minimal compared to that of clouds. \n\nDon't forget that CO2 is essential to life on Earth. The planet's core is cooling. The more it cools, the less volcanic activity there is. The less volcanic activity there is, the less CO2 there is. Two hundred million years ago the CO2 level was about 2,000 parts per million. Today, it is only about 400 parts per million and 100 of that is only because of our burning fossil fuels. Any attempt to reduce CO2 emissions is not just silly, it's downright dangerous. Please stop worrying about man made global warming. If you want to worry about climate change, worry about the next ice age.

While he is correct that temperatures have been warming since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human emissions of CO2 didn't become globally significant until the middle of the 20th century.

According to actual science (as opposed to career politicians like James Hansen), the sensitivity of the global climate system to a doubling of CO2 is, at best, 1C.

The effect of CO2 on temperature is logarithmic.  So, once you double CO2 levels, you have to double them again to get another 1C of warming.   To get 2C of warming, we would have to quadruple CO2 levels.  Nobody seriously thinks that going to happen.\n\n5.  6C is ludicrous.

We are adding a whole lot more of them into the atmosphere. From CO2 bubbles trapped in ice we can tell that the CO2 level fluctuated between 200 and 280 ppm for the past 400,000 years. Until it started steadily rising along with our CO2 emissions (there are other gases but far more CO2 is produced than any other). \n\nThere has been a slight between emissions and CO2 levels. Why? Because CO2 stays in the atmosphere for a very long period of time. Imagine a river of CO2 running into a lake of our atmosphere. The only problem is that it is nothing like that because it is constantly recycled back into the atmosphere thanks to the carbon cycle.\n\nLastly, 2016 was the hottest year on record, reaching at least 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures (New Scientist). 2015 was the hottest year before that. Guess what? 2014 was the hottest year even before that. That is somewhat to be expected because of the El Ni√±o cycle, but still, several other years have exceeded the 1998 record setting average temperature. It was also a very strong El Ni√±o event, however the global land temperature anomaly was only 0.93 degrees C above the 20th century average, compared to a 1.43 degree anomaly in 2016 (NOAA). (Yes, water does heat slower than land, and it was still above the '98 average).\n\nOne last thing, solar activity has been on the decline while the climate has been on the incline. Even the effects of a grand solar minimum, the last one of which coincided with the little ice age... caused only 0.4 degrees of cooling. Considering we are heading for 6 degrees of warming by 2100 solar activity is irrelevant.\nOur entire civilization, from the wheel to agriculture and the iphone, arose from a period of climatic stability, varying about 1 degree in 12,000 years.

Animals and the ice in Greenland or the antartic are 2 great Indicators.  So why are birds now for the first time in recorder history taking different migration routes? All sort of plants and animals are growing or traveling differently due to the increased temperature. You can see it with your own eyes. Just check some of the bird migration charts and compare with the rise in temperature.  The two graphs mirror each other.  Secondly explain how ice suddenly melts more in 2 years than the prior 80 years. The ice isn't republican or democratic.  It has no interest in being one way or the other it just is. And it's melting at a rate that's astonishing.  I know the sea levels of 2 or 3 cm a year don't seem like much but just 50 years from now you're talking 5ft of water higher on all the coastlines and 6 or 7 major US cities underwater. The problem is people only live 70 or 80 years so they think it doesn't have such an affect on them. Think about your grandchildren then.   Besides the 13 hottest years on record being recorded in a 14 yr period from 2001-2014 (what a coincidence ). So 3 things Animal and plant behavioral patterns. Ice melting at record paces.

{"cid": "Ugg-nPx7wLxE-3gCoAEC", "text": "It's been a while since I've seen him speak, but the author of \"Thin Ice\" described the famous \"hockey stick curve\". Ice core samples proved the predictable pattern of \"natural\" global warming (as it was seen before we came along - CO2 measurements in the air bubbles of very deep ice core samples - each layer representing a normal winter freeze/thaw cycle) that preceded each ice age. The scientists prove with very boring data/detail that there has always been a cycle of warming and then cooling. Unfortunately, the earth's way of finding this balance is violent; a warming of the earth's core resulting in even more unstable crust/fault-lines cascading to huge volcanic eruptions which darken the atmosphere so very little solar energy can enter. What follows is ice covering the majority of the earth's surface. Leading up to that moment are more and more earth-quakes, especially under the oceans leading to¬†tsunami's that are starting to become even more and more commonplace today. The next ice age happens without our help. Global warming and cooling is a natural cycle that is a wonder of the nature of this earth. But the ice core samples prove that we have accelerated the CO2 levels faster than any other cycle. I ask the nay sayers a different question. What do we have to lose by making positive changes - from which we all benefit. There's a real chance another issue exists - which is peak oil. The unpredictable rise of gas prices that hits your wallet at least and causes wars and cripples nations at most. Wouldn't innovating feel good? Especially in the USA. We can still re-invent ourselves around these new challenges and bring ourselves energy independence! Countries that are energy independent are rich and healthy. Keep it positive.

{"cid": "Ugi0Lnhg3sSrZHgCoAEC", "text": "I'm gonna take a stab at this and see what happens, but I kinda know already.....here goes.\n\nI have never once said that climate change is not happening. The climate has changed, to extremes, ever since there has been an atmosphere, for some 1 billion years. Life on earf has been around for some 600 million years. There have been at least 5 extinction events that wiped out more than 50% of ALL life in that period, sometimes almost instantly, and man was never ever around to see it, participate in it, much less cause it. I use that to make my point. David Roberts believes that increased co2 in the atmosphere by even a tiny amount will be catastrophic. Historically speaking, and not just the last million years, co2 levels have been much much higher than they are now. The earf has had the most biodiversity when co2 levels were well over 1,000 ppm, more than twice what it is now. The highest concentrations of co2 were above 4,000 ppm during the Ordovician - Silurian and the Jurassic - Cretaceous periods, and life did just fine. So, historically speaking, current co2 levels are at least 10 times lower than in the past. The last extinction event, but smaller by comparison to the 5 largest, happened about 20,000 years ago when co2 levels dropped below 200 ppm. Our ancestors were almost wiped out. Plants did not prosper, so there was very very little to eat for any animals period. Plants prefer co2 levels above 1,000 ppm, that's why we raise them in green houses. The earf's biosphere adapts to changing climate, hence why the earf doesn't go over a tipping point like Venus, which is in a runaway greenhouse environment, and nothing can survive.\nSo why all the fuss about global warming, climate change and co2? I will tell you that it is not about saving the polar bears, saving the planet, saving the oysters, saving our coastlines or saving humanity. It is about power and control. It is about powerful all encompassing government control of our lives because we are not capable of making proper choices for ourselves. We are too stupid. Just ask Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare.\nIf the only cure to stop anthropogenic global warming didn't involve the extraction of money and wealth from individuals and nations, I would be less suspect. But, when you follow the money and government control infrastructure, the answer is clear.¬†", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "danahan01", "channel": "UCO7hXdUOhEfLAe3wUkeAqsw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSmbQ9zNSVj2bvJcZ--flx8WrE2QbVnlVpUl0ZT=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UghjVxGxQzeIa3gCoAEC", "text": ".¬† It is an interesting exercise to think about how climate changes could affect human life on the planet.¬† Here are some thoughts:\nScenario #1:¬† Releases for methane from the Arctic Ocean sediments.\nApparently the Arctic Ocean sediments have about 1.5 trillion tons of carbon in the form of methane locked up as methane-hydrate.¬† The methane-hydrate is kept bottled up by an underwater permafrost layer.¬† Just like oil, it has been there from millions of years.¬† A reasonable question is that if it has been there for millions of years why should we think that it will be released now.¬† The reason is that Arctic Ocean ice is melting and for the first time in human history this coming September (2015) there is expected to be zero ice covering the Arctic Ocean.¬† In subsequent years the ice is expected to be melted earlier and earlier.¬† In the summer the top of the earth is tilted toward the sun, thus instead of ice reflecting sunlight away from the planet, the dark water will absorb it warming the water column and then eventually the permafrost releasing the methane.¬† Since methane is about 77 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than is CO-2, the 1.5 trillion tons is equivalent to 115 trillion tons of carbon as CO-2.¬† The current excess of carbon in the atmosphere is about 0.5 trillion tons.¬† If only 10% of the Arctic methane is released, that would be equivalent to increasing the excess CO-2 in the atmosphere by a factor of 23, or 2300%.¬† This would be equivalent to a CO-2 concentration in the atmosphere of over 3000 ppm.¬† The current excess atmospheric CO-2 is causing all kinds of problems such as more extensive forest fires, more severe hurricanes and tornadoes, increased acidification of the ocean, and melting of glaciers, snow cover and ocean ice.¬†¬† It is hard to imagine that terrestrial life could survive such an event.¬† Also, it is so far beyond the human experience that accurate modeling is impossible. The unique thing about this scenario is that it could happen soon.¬†\n\nScenario #2:¬† Continued slow heating of the planet.\nThe heat balance of the planet is not in line with what it should be.¬† ¬†Over the last several million years, including the time humans have been on the planet, the heat coming in has been equal to that leaving the planet, at least when averaged over an ice-age cycle, or over periods of several years within an ice-age cycle.¬† While humans inhabited this planet we have had the benefit of a fairly consistent biosphere, or at least one that has been consistent enough for us to survive and adapt.¬† If the planet had an atmosphere that had no greenhouse gases in it, the average annual temperature has been estimated to be about 0 degrees Fahrenheit.¬† The CO-2 level in the atmosphere has oscillated between 180 and 280 parts per million, the lower number when the earth was in its coldest state of each ice age cycle and the higher number when it was in its warmest state.¬† The CO-2 level did not drive the temperature but followed it.¬† The temperature was driven by the precession of the earth‚Äôs orbit.¬† ¬†At this point in the current ice-age cycle the concentration of CO-2 should be about 280 parts per million, but because of humans using fossil fuels it is about 400 parts per million.¬† At 280 parts per million the average temperature has been measured to be about 57 degrees Fahrenheit.¬† Now that the CO-2 concentration is 400 parts per million, heat from sunlight is building up in the planet and the world average temperature is closer to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.¬† The excess heat mostly ends up in heating the oceans because water has a much larger heat capacity than does the atmosphere, so humans don‚Äôt notice it very much.¬† In addition to heating up the oceans, some of the heat goes into melting ice and heating the land.¬† Ice is important because it reflects sunlight back to space so helps to keep the planet cool.¬† As the ice disappears the heat imbalance will get even worse.¬† In addition, humans will continue adding CO-2 to the atmosphere, currently at a rate of 33 billion tons worldwide annually; thus, it is expected that heating will continue to rise until crops are affected, by drying out of the planet soils and by planet climate changes.¬† It is likely that the northern hemisphere will be affected first as there is much more ice in the Antarctic than in Greenland.¬† There will be significant food shortages and die-off of human populations.¬† Whether or not countries in the northern hemisphere will continue to exist and for how long is impossible to predict. At some point oil use will be significantly reduced because of large-scale death of humans, and the snowballing effect will slow down to some extent, and maybe the planet heat balance will come back into equilibrium over time, but that could only happen if the temperature of the ocean and land surfaces are significantly hotter to radiate heat back out to space.¬† Exactly how hot they have to be to bring the heat flow back into balance is unknown.¬† ¬†¬†\n¬†\nScenario #3:¬† Death of the oceans and the rain forests.¬†¬†¬†¬†\nThe Amazon rain forests and the oceans are essentially the lungs of the planet.¬† They work to keep the balance between atmospheric CO-2 and O-2 constant.¬† The Amazon rain forests may be lost because of changing rainfall patterns.¬† Apparently they are currently under drought conditions.¬† The oceans are becoming more acid because of increased CO-2 in them.¬† CO-2 combines with a water molecule, H20 to produce H2CO3.¬† The H2CO3 molecule disassociates to H+ and HCO3-, thus there are more H+ molecules, or an increase in acidity.¬† Currently there are about 30% more H+ molecules in ocean waters than before humans started using fossil fuels.¬† There are several species of animals in the ocean that have to calcify their shells which becomes more difficult with increasing acidity.¬† If the oceans and/or the rain forests are seriously affected it is hard to imagine that the atmosphere will be stable enough for terrestrial life forms to continue to survive.", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Walt P", "channel": "UCiO0M57MGS2GF3atauNKsLA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRXFIm3j9bKjhFh77k8ZMEAQBUJiWcVU30ZXQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

An increase of gases such as CO2 makes the atmosphere more opaque at infrared wavelengths. This added opacity causes the planet‚Äôs heat radiation to space to arise from higher, colder levels in the atmosphere, thus reducing emission of heat energy to space. The temporary imbalance between the energy absorbed from the Sun and heat emission to space, causes the planet to warm until planetary energy balance is restored.‚Äù\n\nSo we have this alleged energy imbalance that is causing the planet to warm. The scientific method requires that one conduct experiments or perform measurements to confirm a hypothesis. So we have satellites that measure EM radiation.\n\nHansen goes on to state:\n\n‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs energy imbalance and its changes will determine the future of Earth‚Äôs climate. It is thus imperative to measure Earth‚Äôs energy imbalance and the factors that are changing it.‚Äù\nThis is true. Because if you don‚Äôt measure the imbalance, you have not confirmed the hypothesis.\nHansen goes on further: ‚ÄúThe required measurement accuracy is ‚àº 0.1 W m‚àí2, in view of the fact that estimated current (2005‚Äì2010) energy imbalance is 0.58 W m-2‚Ä≥.\n\nHansen then begins to admit the problems with performing the measurements.\n\n‚ÄúThe difficulty with the satellite approach becomes clear by considering first the suggestion of measuring Earth‚Äôs reflected sunlight and emitted heat from a satellite at the Lagrange L1 point, which is a location between the Sun and Earth at which the gravitational pulls from these bodies are equal and opposite. From this location the satellite would continually stare at the sunlit half of Earth. The notion that a single satellite at this point could measure Earth‚Äôs energy imbalance to 0.1 W m ‚àí2 is prima facie preposterous. Earth emits and scatters radiation in all directions, i.e., into 4œÄ steradians. How can measurement of radiation in a single direction provide a proxy for radiation in all directions?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is implausible that changes in the angular distribution of radiation could be modeled to the needed accuracy, and the objective is to measure the imbalance, not guess at it. There is also the difficulty of maintaining sensor calibrations to accuracy 0.1 W m‚àí2, i.e., 0.04 percent. That accuracy is beyond the state-of-the art, even for short periods, and that accuracy would need to be maintained for decades‚Äù\n\nThe above satellite was in a fixed location. Hansen goes on:\n\n‚ÄúThese same problems, the changing angular distribution of the scattered and emitted radiation fields and maintaining extreme precision of sensors over long periods, must be faced by Earth-orbiting satellites‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe precision achieved by the most advanced generation of radiation budget satellites is indicated by the planetary energy imbalance measured by the ongoing CERES (Clouds and the Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy System) instrument (Loeb et al., 2009), which finds a measured 5-yr-mean imbalance of 6.5 W m‚àí2 (Loeb et al., 2009).Because this result is implausible, instrumentation calibration factors were introduced to reduce the imbalance to the imbalance suggested by climate models, 0.85 W m-2‚Ä≥\n\nOK my little religious groupies, what is the problem?\"", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "Equs Narnd", "channel": "UCDsDbAyzyNW0iR4lYvKuY1A", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLShLJx-7XzSFi1100LG0j2UOzZlk47-AExkLvPpcQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Which in a way is what is happening in the US. Our government has become a wealth transfer mechanism where by the people that produce like myself have most of their money confiscated by the government, and they give it to people you choose not to produce anything of any value.\n\nIn Switzerland, which I'm thinking is where you are from, you have what would best be described as a \"representative direct democracy\". You still have a Parliament, which would be similar to the Congress of the US, which consist of two houses (the Council of States and the National Council) which would reflect the US Senate and US House of Representatives. Switzerland's Parliament is elected, however, the level of accountability in Switzerland is what I would consider higher because politicians answer more directly to the public, and are much more limited in power than the US. I believe the US form of government that was formed over 200 years ago is a better system of government, but over the last 80 or so years, esp. just before WWII the US began a systematic decline as more and more of the public has become apathetic and thus allowed the US Federal Government to become so large, powerful and burdensome on the population that the US public has become so dependent on the Federal Government that we really no longer have much of a vote in how the country is run. I am what would be considered an \"ultra-conservative\" by some in the US because I believe in gun rights, freedom from government, and personal responsibility which includes, but is not limited to the right to fail, the right to retain as much as you can from your business ventures, and the right to hold my elected officials accountable for their actions. Unfortunately I am the minority in the US as most people receive some form of government assistance via welfare, medicare/medicaid, social security, public housing, etc., that most people in the US cannot live without the government. I on the other hand am prepared to leave society as a whole, and live with my family away from civilization because at some point a house built out of a deck of cards falls. I see the US failing as a organized government within my lifetime, and have taken steps so the my family can survive as long as possible without any modern infrastructure, and possibly be part of whatever happens after the collapse and reset of the US government, and for that matter humanity in general.\n\nWell, that pretty much describes my views of the world, you might have a little bit better understanding of why global warming is not what concerns me.\n\nNow having said all that, my smoking hot wife and I are going to spend the rest of the day doing a little last minute Christmas shopping and watching my Seattle Seahawks play the Arizona Cardinals later on. It is the biggest game of the year for the Hawks and has huge playoff consequences for both teams. And of course I will partake in a couple adult beverages and a fine cigar.

More co2=more plants=more animals and more biodiversity and more food for humans. More co2 means longer growing seasons=more food for humans. Also, we are constantly being berated with enviro's telling us that adding modest amounts of co2 like we currently are will have catastrophic effects on climate, when in actuality the observed effects differ greatly from the predictions of the global warming warmonger crowd. They have told us that adding co2 will warm the climate. If you do and honest and scientific evaluation of temperature, the planet is not warming anywhere near what we have been told it should be. Also, scientists that measure global temperatures correctly have noticed that the planet is not warming, and in many places it is cooling, but you don't hear that from the global warming crowd.

So I'll try again....\n\nI have never once said that climate change is not happening. The climate has changed, to extremes, ever since there has been an atmosphere, for some 1 billion years. Life on earf has been around for some 600 million years. There have been at least 5 extinction events that wiped out more than 50% of ALL life in that period, sometimes almost instantly, and man was never ever around to see it or participate in it, much less cause it. I use that to make my point. You believe that increased co2 in the atmosphere by even a tiny amount will be catastrophic. Historically speaking, and not just the last million years, co2 levels have been much much higher than they are now. The earf has had the most biodiversity when co2 levels were well over 1,000 ppm. The highest concentrations of co2 were above 4,000 ppm during the Ordovician- Silurian and the Jurassic-Cretaceous periods. And life did just fine. So, historically speaking, current co2 levels are at least 10 times less than in the past. The last extinction event, but smaller by comparison to the 5 largest, happened about 20,000 years ago when co2 levels dropped to below 200 ppm. Our ancestors were almost wiped out. Plants did not prosper, so there was very very little to eat, for any animals period. Plants prefer co2 above 1,000 ppm, that's why we raise them in green houses. The earf's biosphere adapts to changing climate, hence why the earf doesn't go over a tipping point like Venus, which is in a runaway greenhouse environment, and nothing can survive. So why all the fuss about global warming, climate change and co2? I will tell you that it is not about saving the polar bears, saving the planet, saving oysters, saving our coastlines or saving humanity. it is about power and control. It is about powerful all encompassing government control of our lives because we are not capable of making proper choices for ourselves. We are too stupid, just ask Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare.\n\nIf the only cure to stop anthropogenic global warming didn't involve the extraction of money and wealth from individuals and nations, I would be less suspect. But, when you follow the money and government control infrastructure, the answer is clear.\n\nLet's see how long this stays up before it's deleted...\nThe global warming warmongers are not about debate, they are about control......", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "danahan01", "channel": "UCO7hXdUOhEfLAe3wUkeAqsw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSmbQ9zNSVj2bvJcZ--flx8WrE2QbVnlVpUl0ZT=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

This has happened before this event and man was never here to see it, and it will happen again.\n\nNow to for your answer on oil independence.\n\nThe United States no longer imports any oil from the middle east. In fact with the development of the Bakken oil fields in the mid-west, we are starting to export oil around the world. So to answer your question, the US dependence on foreign oil is almost zilch, zero, nada....OPEC can no longer manipulate the price of oil around the world and with the price of oil now below $70/barrel for the first time in 20 years, oil supplies have been stabilized around the world, even with the strife in the middle east.\n\nNow, I will take my tongue out of my cheek, because I know what you were asking.....\n\nAlmost every modern technology that we have developed has been because of fossil fuels. If the earth did not have fossil fuels as a inexpensive resource, we would still be living like we did in the early 1800's. There would be no plastics, no computers, no cars, no tv, no electricity, no airplanes, no trains, no satellites, no cell phones, no vaccines, rudimentary healthcare would be the norm, and I'm talking cotton bandages at best. So try living just one day without any of the items I mentioned De. You couldn't do it, unless you lived completely off the grid and had a horse for commuting.\n\nWould it be a good idea to have as little dependence on fossil fuels as possible? Yes. But what in the name of God do you replace it with? We will need oil and fossil fuels until we can harness the power of fusion nuclear reactors. Fission works great, but what do you do with the waste? Fusion produces fantastic amounts of energy with very little waste, but the technology is not within our grasp, mainly because we are too afraid to develop it. Matter-anti-matter reactors could do it. But the Enterprise from Star Trek is centuries from our grasp. So, we have fossil fuels, and that is what we will use until we develop the next generation of energy that is cheaper than fossil fuels, and produces the amounts of energy we need. Fossil fuels will get us to the next generation, we just need to agree on what that will be and move forward. But there will always be trade offs. Nuclear produces waste, wind doesn't produce when it's not windy, hydro(which makes the most sense to me)blocks rivers and alters ecosystems on a grand scale. Solar, the technology doesn't exist to harness the Sun yet cheaply. So we use oil.\n\nSpeaking of oil, I need to run into town and get the oil changed in my hot rod that I use to commute 100 miles a day to work and back.

Less than 2 % of the abstracts rejected this view.\"\n\nAgnotology, Scientific Consensus, and the Teachingand Learning of Climate Change: A Response to Legates,\nSoon and Briggs\nBedford et al. 2013", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "ThePrimativeOne", "channel": "UCeRZfe5vljROcv0YtGDthIg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQfmzukXi-1_NnHumcxeCIQzVKOHxVEhK8KVA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

It's well documented that some of the most prominent have and do; for the life of me I have no idea why if global warming is a legitimate concern. The argument keeps changing as well. First global warming, then cooling, then warming, now it's generic \"climate change\". I guess it's difficult to stick with the warming argument when surface temperatures stop rising. The models and explanations keep getting more complex and sophisticated in order to explain why previous predictions don't pan out. And then there's Al Gore. The man is unstable. It's unfortunate for your side of the argument too. How can anyone take what he says seriously? Explain how he could, with a clear conscience, sell Current TV to Al Jezeera? We (the middle class) must restrict carbon emissions, but it's okay for him to accept hundreds of millions of dollars in oil money? Give me a break. So, yes, I agree, the climate is changing. Anthropogenically? Maybe, perhaps CO2 is playing a higher order role, but I don't think it's the main driver. What really concerns me about your side of the argument is the totalitarian-like tactics in play to squash the debate. The 97% consensus figure is a complete joke. So, in the end, it comes down to trust. Although I am a scientist and engineer by trade, I am not a climate expert nor do I have the time to become one. I will rely on what little common sense I have and a generic distrust of those seeking to degrade my liberties. I don't trust the UN. I don't trust academics whose best argument is to attempt to discredit the other side and who rely of political funding. So, as a skeptic (somewhat on the fence), I am going to sit back and watch. If surface temperatures continue to fall, then I will know that it's as I expected. If not, then I will reevaluate my position.

What has surface temperature of the Earth done in the last 15 or so years? Has it declined? I believe it has. Has CO2 emissions decreased or increased during this time? I believe they have continued to increased. Fifteen years is a negligible amount of geological time, but it is a rather large percentage of time relative to the beginning of the industrial age. So, if CO2 is a first order factor in surface temperature, why has mean surface temperature decreased? It seems to me that it should continue to steadily rise. I think climate scientist have a good \"hand waving\" explanation for this, but I'm not buying it. What it tells me is that they don't really have a clue or they're operating with other motives. Either way, I'm not convinced.¬†\n\nYes, the year to year weather patterns are changing, but isn't that just what happens? The Earth is a dynamic and complex system.

Earth Climate Summit (1992) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil revealed the real goal: ‚ÄúWe may get to the point where the only way of saving the world will be for industrialized civilization to collapse.‚Äù\nFormer U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth (D-CO), then representing the Clinton-Gore administration as U.S undersecretary of state for global issues, addressing the same Rio Climate Summit audience, agreed: ‚ÄúWe have got to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.‚Äù (Wirth now heads the U.N. Foundation which lobbies for hundreds of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to help underdeveloped countries fight climate change.)\nAlso speaking at the Rio conference, Deputy Assistant of State Richard Benedick, who then headed the policy divisions of the U.S. State Department said: ‚ÄúA global warming treaty [Kyoto] must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the [enhanced] greenhouse effect.‚Äù\nIn 1988, former Canadian Minister of the Environment, told editors and reporters of the Calgary Herald: ‚ÄúNo matter if the science of global warming is all phony‚Ä¶climate change [provides] the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world.‚Äù\nIn 1996, former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev emphasized the importance of using climate alarmism to advance socialist Marxist objectives: ‚ÄúThe threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key to unlock the New World Order.‚Äù\nSpeaking at the 2000 U.N. Conference on Climate Change in the Hague, former President Jacques Chirac of France explained why the IPCC‚Äôs climate initiative supported a key Western European Kyoto Protocol objective: ‚ÄúFor the first time, humanity is instituting a genuine instrument of global governance, one that should find a place within the World Environmental Organization which France and the European Union would like to see established.‚Äù\"\n\nClimate policy has almost nothing to do anymore with environmental protection, says the German economist and IPCC official Ottmar Edenhofer. The next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the world‚Äôs resources will be negotiated. ‚Äì Ottmar Edenhofer\nFor those who may not know, Ottmar Edenhofer is the co-chair of the IPCC Working Group III.\n\nhttp://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/11/18/ipcc-official-%e2%80%9cclimate-policy-is-redistributing-the-worlds-wealth%e2%80%9d/\n\n¬†It's just a conspiracy \"theory\".", "time": "7 years ago", "author": "Andrew Mirlach", "channel": "UCYXWplKzkvmfrXnMintjaUw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSws2Z5zIx4k_4MzTa_6IwzTfPY_Iz0eYAxBg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

So I will respond.\n\nWhy is point 1. irrelevant? That might be the most important point of all. You actually got close to answering it when you responded to point 3. (plant a billion trees). So here is how the two connect.\n\nPlants need large amounts of co2 to survive. In fact most plants prefer co2 levels that are around 800 ppm, about twice what it is now, and that is why we create artificial environments to grow healthy plants.\n\nSince plants like somewhat higher co2 levels than we have currently, as co2 rises, more plants will grow and produce more oxygen. However, planting a \"billion trees\" is not the answer. The oceans are the answer. Microscopic plants in the oceans create more oxygen and lock up more carbon than all the plants and trees on land combined!! The earf has this nice balance of power tug of war going on and it keeps our ecosystems in relative harmony. Even when a super volcano erupts, asteroid hits, and prolonged ice ages come about, the earf finds a way to balance it out. My contention is that even if we artificially raise co2 in the atmosphere, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Also, global warming is not happening in the respect that it is portrayed.\n\nAs more sea ice melts, it changes the salinity of the oceans, thus changing ocean currents. The biggest effect currently to the climate is the Thermohaline circulation of the oceans. Here is a short excerpt from a scientific article about it.\n\n\"The adjective thermohaline derives from thermo- referring to temperature and -haline referring to salt content, factors which together determine the density of sea water. Wind-driven surface currents (such as the Gulf Stream) travel polewards from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, cooling en route, and eventually sinking at high latitudes (forming North Atlantic Deep Water). This dense water then flows into the ocean basins. While the bulk of it upwells in the Southern Ocean, the oldest waters (with a transit time of around 1000 years) upwell in the North Pacific. Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins, reducing differences between them and making the Earth's oceans a global system. On their journey, the water masses transport both energy (in the form of heat) and matter (solids, dissolved substances and gases) around the globe. As such, the state of the circulation has a large impact on the climate of the Earth\".\n\nIn short, as the oceans salinity is changed by adding more fresh water, the ocean currents then change, and the result is a cooling affect, which then adds more ice to the poles, increasing ocean salinity and so on. Things get thrown somewhat out of balance when there is to much cooling, co2 levels drop dramatically to less than half current levels and you have runaway cooling resulting in an ice age that lasts for tens of centuries or longer. It is not until the co2 levels begin to rise, and the earf warms that the climate becomes more like it is now.\n\nI postulate that by artificially adding co2, we will bring the earf back into an ice age quicker than it would normally, say in 10 to 15 thousand years from now, instead of 30 to 80 thousand years, which would be the historic normal cycle. There is also evidence that this cooling affect is starting to happen now, as the winters of the last few years have been much colder than normal, esp. in the northern hemisphere. I had never ever heard of the term \"Polar Vortex\" until last winter, have you??¬† We are even seeing that happen now, as the mid-west is currently trapped in unseasonably cold weather 20 to 30 degrees below normal for early fall.\n\nWhat say you??", "time": "6 years ago", "author": "danahan01", "channel": "UCO7hXdUOhEfLAe3wUkeAqsw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSmbQ9zNSVj2bvJcZ--flx8WrE2QbVnlVpUl0ZT=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Definitely a pleasure then to reason this, although unscientifically, with you.\n\nYou are right. Plants do thrive on higher concentrations of CO2. Unfortunately, humans don't and that's why we don't live in greenhouses. By the time the plants catch up with the rise of CO2, assuming of course we let them which we won't as we don't already, there might be some mammals on the planet to enjoy the CO2 free atmosphere. I doubt it will be humans.¬†\n\n02 produced in the sea is due to algae which are dying because of the constant temperature rise of the sea further exacerbating the problem.\n\nCurrents. By changing/stopping the currents you are only changing the distribution of heat. That means that you will have places in the North with a heck of a lot colder climate, (for as long as that lasts) and places in the equator which will positively boil. HOWEVER, the NET result on the average GLOBAL temperature remains unchanged and RISING.\n\nWhat you don't seem to understand, probably because you are not aware of how evolution works, is that it takes many thousands of years for species to become acclimatized to the new conditions. That is why (actually its the reverse and that's why life was possible on earth until now, but its funny to reverse the sequence) climate changes in the past took, as you mentioned 30-80k years. Consider that homo sapiens alone has been around for roughly 200k years. Imagine the time scale. ¬†Then do the climate change in the real blink of the eye which has been the last 200 years. There is the problem. And don't think we will be fine because we have AC. We still need to eat and the rest of the animal kingdom hasn't, till now, discovered electricity to run their climate control systems.\n\nAs to your 3, you have been fed lies by the people that would have you brush this off as another conspiracy by your communist leader (LOL), playing on the usual american lack of education and pre-conditioned fear of the reds!!!\nTRUTH: Sustainable energy sources are cheaper, will produce much more wealth for far greater numbers of your co-patriots (not just the factory owners and the oil moguls) and are...

It requires statistical modeling of diverse measures to see those trends and their impact. It is entirely understandable that there is a vigorous skeptical group that questions various aspects of the theory. Every aspect: anthropogenic and global and warming is questioned by some group. I honestly don't think the reason for the skepticism is widespread disinformation conspiracies or big oil. It is just a very abstract data set, impossible to substantiate with a sound bite or even with an hour long program.

Understanding global warming really is simple. Scientists know exactly how CO2 gas behaves (the physics of gases are very precisely understood). Unlike other atmospheric gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, CO2 absorbs radiation as heat. The balance elevation where the radiation striking the earth and being emitted back into space goes higher as CO2 builds up in the atmosphere. The average temperature of the earth's surface increases in direct proportion to this rise in elevation of the radiation balance point. The rise in temperature at the surface causes more water to evaporate, and water vapor also absorbs radiation as heat, multiplying the heating. This much is known for certain. We only don't know exactly how much the various multiplier effects will come into play, and we can only hope that those effects will not be as much as this speaker, and many of the rest of us, are afraid is the case.

{"cid": "UghskobdlBL2dXgCoAEC", "text": "And interesting take on a relatively complicated problem. But like the NASA sciences, that refuse to tie in the Sun activity to the climate change, these scientists are lacking in the solar reports issued from 2008, which clearly give the reason to the rise in temperatures and it is not related to human activity. In fact, the entrepreneurial Hollywood artists, made a movie, using that report called \"2012\".\n\nAmong other information, the report stated these facts: sun has altered its emissions. (In other words, the wave form length of energy has altered) This is now acting upon the Core, and the Core is heating. This heat wave we experience, is coming from below the ground, not the atmosphere; nor does the main increase in heat have anything to do with carbon emissions or human activity. ¬†The next thing the report stated, was that the rate of Decay had sped up. (In other words a piece of fruit that lasted good more than a week, decays and goes bad in under a 7 day week) It also stated, and this is very important to understand: Every where the now failing EM Field is breached by the in-streaming solar particles, Matter is being mutated.\n\nIt is the UN that has ordered the use of chemsprays, and they just admitted to that this year. Stating that survival on earth depends on their use. What they did not state, and what is hidden buried on their own websites, is what is in that spray. Nanites which have created Morgellons, as they alter mankind - look up \"2045\" and you can watch their video of what these nanites are for; specific poisons that deliberately target all mammalian life forms among which now neurologist are speaking out about the spike in neuro degenerative diseases; deliberate altering of the ph balance of soils which is causing mass crop failure, destroying forests worldwide, so that they can patent their Monsanto seeds which are bred for that specifically altered soil - which has resulted in the extinction of bees worldwide; the manipulation of weather and earthquakes as they kill off massive areas, which allows the UN to go in under the guise of aid, such as in the Philippines, and this allows them to directly use sterilization with depo provera in food additives and vaccines, Monsanto seeds, and they seize lands under Agenda 21 under the claim of 'rebuilding' for the population; and their creation and use of Agenda 21 to seize all land and natural resources for their own benefit while exterminating 6 billion people. A plan which was a cooked up 'climate change' program from the Club of Rome, the sister branch of the Bilderberg.\n\nThe simple fact is that these scientists are not given all the pertinent facts related to the issue, which leads them to build a theory based a proverbial house of cards. Neither the planet, nor the sun, work in the manner they have been educated to believe. The sun goes through this cycle, to make the evolutionary jump of species planet wide. And the Bilderberg and their related groups, deliberately suppress information so that they can use these scientists as pawns to 'back up\" their propaganda, which is for the express purpose of genocide in order to control the planet by a few elites.

As such, the reason why the climate models are running too hot compared to observations,¬†is because¬†their assumed¬†sensitivity¬†number is too high. It really is that simple. Their basic assumption is that all of the warming since about 1950 is due to CO2, and this then becomes the assumed sensitivity fed into the models. However, there is no evidence that this assumption is correct, and in fact the increasing¬†divergence between the model outputs and the observational data suggests that their basic assumption about the quantum of the sensitivity is not accurate. Also the plateau in global temperatures for the last decade, [according to the IPCC's¬†latest report],WITH the concurrent 5% increase in CO2,¬†¬†again strongly suggests that the sensitivity number is too high. And it¬†goes gets back to the fundamental assumption that ALL of the recent¬†warming is due to CO2.
