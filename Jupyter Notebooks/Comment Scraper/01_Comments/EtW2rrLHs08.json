To a great extent, they also accept without question the completely outdated and definitively scientifically disproven paradigm of Newtonian Materialism. True Science is a methodology of truth discovery, and not a \"belief system\" as dictated by modern worldly institutions. Some of the foundational hallmarks of Government-grant-money-funded materialistic \"science\" include ignoring entire data sets, and fudging existing data to fit their own deeply entrenched worldview. The emerging modern sciences of Epigenetics and Holistic Biology are just now beginning to turn the tide in such a worldview by rightly incorporating Consciousness and metaphysical understanding into their research methodologies.", "time": "2 days ago", "author": "Rain Dog", "channel": "UC8w1mSOapK7ptiqnn_kN4bg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/0OSUhST8csb6PLDiL-ezNRFISQT13YTSUgF3OA4Xw38tr2U5BctRI8yUs0JNk6NVolqWXYzE=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The British philosopher Sir Karl Popper (1902‚Äì94) proposed the criterion as a foundational method of the empirical sciences. He held that genuinely scientific theories are never finally confirmed, because disconfirming observations (observations that are inconsistent with the empirical predictions of the theory) are always possible no matter how many confirming observations have been made. Scientific theories are instead incrementally corroborated through the absence of disconfirming evidence in a number of well-designed experiments. According to Popper, some disciplines that have claimed scientific validity‚Äîe.g., astrology, metaphysics, Marxism, and psychoanalysis ‚Äîare not empirical sciences, because their subject matter cannot be falsified in this manner.\r\n\r\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Matt Stefon, Assistant Editor.\r\n\n\nKarl Popper\r\nKarl Popper\r\n‚Ä¶what he called the ‚Äúfalsifiability criterion.‚Äù Under this method, a scientist seeks to discover an observed exception to his postulated rule. The absence of contradictory evidence thereby becomes corroboration of his theory. According to Popper, such pseudosciences as astrology, metaphysics, Marxist history, and Freudian psychoanalysis are not empirical sciences,‚Ä¶\r\n\n\n\n\nWRITTEN BY\r\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\r\nEncyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree....\r\nSee Article History\r\nLaw of nature, in the philosophy of science, a stated regularity in the relations or order of phenomena in the world that holds, under a stipulated set of conditions, either universally or in a stated proportion of instances. (The notion is distinct from that of a natural law‚Äîi.e., a law of right or justice supposedly derived from nature.)\r\n\r\nLaws of nature are of two basic forms: (1) a law is universal if it states that some conditions, so far as are known, invariably are found together with certain other conditions; and (2) a law is probabilistic if it affirms that, on the average, a stated fraction of cases displaying a given condition will display a certain other condition as well. In either case, a law may be valid even though it obtains only under special circumstances or as a convenient approximation. Moreover, a law of nature has no logical necessity; rather, it rests directly or indirectly upon the evidence of experience.\r\n\r\nLaws of universal form must be distinguished from generalizations, such as ‚ÄúAll chairs in this office are gray,‚Äù which appear to be accidental. Generalizations, for example, cannot support counterfactual conditional statements such as ‚ÄúIf this chair had been in my office, it would be gray‚Äù nor subjunctive conditionals such as ‚ÄúIf this chair were put in my office, it would be gray.‚Äù On the other hand, the statement ‚ÄúAll planetary objects move in nearly elliptical paths about their stars‚Äù does provide this support. All scientific laws appear to give similar results. The class of universal statements that can be candidates for the status of laws, however, is determined at any time in history by the theories of science then current.\r\n\r\nSeveral positive attributes are commonly required of a law of nature. Statements about things or events limited to one location or one date cannot be lawlike. Also, most scientists hold that the predicate must apply to evidence not used in deriving the law: though the law is founded upon experience, it must predict or help one to understand matters not included among those experiences. Finally, it is normally expected that a law will be explainable by more embracing laws or by some theory. Thus, a regularity for which there are general theoretical grounds will be more readily called a law of nature than an empirical regularity that cannot be subsumed under more general laws or theories.\r\n\r\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.\r\nSubscribe Now\r\nUniversal laws are of several types. Many assert a dependence between varying quantities measuring certain properties, as in the law that the pressure of a gas under steady temperature is inversely proportional to its volume (see Boyle‚Äôs law). Others state that events occur in an invariant order, as in ‚ÄúVertebrates always occur in the fossil record after the rise of invertebrates.‚Äù Last, there are laws affirming that if an object is of a stated sort it will have certain observable properties. Part of the reason for the ambiguity of the term law of nature lies in the temptation to apply it only to statements of one of these sorts of laws, as in the claim that science deals solely with cause and effect relationships, when in fact all three kinds are equally valid.\r\n\r\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Brian Duignan, Senior Editor.", "time": "2 months ago", "author": "Wells Aamodt", "channel": "UCpklnibNI9oV72tTc5IT-Fg", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTpzKzYIZYWkswa_jZXl_zcpg2EBIeZBkP0Kg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

However, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal infrared energy.\"\n\n\"When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Like coals from a fire that are warm but not glowing, greenhouse gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in ALL DIRECTIONS\".\n\n\"Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate heat in ALL DIRECTIONS, some of it spreads downward and ultimately comes back into contact with the Earth‚Äôs surface, where it is absorbed. The temperature of the surface becomes warmer than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating of the Earth‚Äôs surface by the atmosphere is the natural greenhouse effect.\"\n\nUp high or down low, I don't see any difference if NASA is correct.  \n\nAt the height of the Atmosphere, the Earth constitutes 1/3rd of the space. So the IR absorbed by the ghg, both for incoming sun heat and emitted Earth heat, will be absorbed then emitted in \"all directions\".  1/3rd will hit the Earth below and the other 2/3rds will go into space. \n\nOf the Earth emitted heat, 1/3rd of that will be absorbed by the ghgs going out, and sent back to the earth adding additional warming to the earth, this warming is the greenhouse effect according to NASA.\n\nSo, water vapor and the ghgs, cool the earth by blocking out 66.4% of Sun heat, while keeping in only 11% (1/3rd of 1/3rd).  The atmosphere keeps out six times more heat than it keeps in.\n\nIf we add more molecules of CO2 they will absorb more entering sun heat and cool the earth more than they do now.  With the earth getting less heat, there will be less heat to keep in, so the GHE should fall.  \n\nI don't see how, if NASA is correct, we can be warming the planet by adding more CO2 to the atmosphere.", "time": "10 months ago", "author": "Bill Andrews", "channel": "UCcrROA3wjSQIyk1oLZC1FRQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSyCnXQMgipRiCFYz7PdTgb_CMKwi5e6jJtbQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Al Gore Jr. is a notable activist who was a student of his. As we all know, Al Gore effectively campaigned for the idea of global warming. ABC even did a special in 2009 where the documentary was supported by contemporary scientists in the productions of the documentary. In the special, they predicted that by 2015, Las Vegas would be abandoned due to hundreds of miles of fires and Miami would be completely flooded out. \nBack to Roger Revelle, in 1988, he began attempts to disseminate new papers and essays that doubts his own idea of CO2 emissions. He developed an about mindset on the entire situation, but anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory supporters either denied or missed these later papers by Revelle. Now, scientists in service to the UN's IPCC and nations around the world base most of their research off of this controversial paper, which does not contain confirmed validity.\nAlso, the Climate Research Unit of East Anglia in the UK had emails exposed by hackers that proved scientists were finding new \"tricks\" to display data in favor of the AGW movement. NASA in 2015 admitted that there was a \"flattening\" in warming temperatures from 1990-2015, indicating that temperatures were no longer rising.", "time": "1 year ago (edited)", "author": "Marcus Venturini", "channel": "UCKPeUCyddgqQyIb6mWyO9dQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRSgoeMP-o6pzD6V9EgofBeuxWE9UegK1CDlA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyN9AYOuMmHHVUgPIR4AaABAg", "text": "I am a strong advocate for reducing pollution of our planet and humans have everything to do with this problem. I also believe that climate change is real. However, the notion that humans are the cause (anthropogenic), or even a significant factor for affecting climate change is ridiculous and nothing more than fake science. The solar cycles are the cause of the warming and cooling phases of the planet. There is irrefutable evidence of this in real science. One example of the lies we have been fed is that CO2 (carbon dioxide) levels have been on the increase because of humans and this so-called ‚Äúgreen house gas‚Äù raises the temperatures of the planet. Actually, what Al Gore and the fake science has told you is totally false. CO2 levels do not go up first (leads) causing a rise in earth temperatures. Exactly the opposite is true because rises in CO2 levels actually LAG increases in temperature by approximately 600 years due to the outgassing of CO2 from the oceans when seawater temperatures increase due to solar radiation. Thousands of years ago, CO2 levels were above 3000 ppm and now they are lower than 500 ppm. This is actually bordering on the lowest levels that can sustain plant life in our biosphere. If anything, we need more CO2, not less.\n\nPart of me wants to stay silent because I welcome anything that encourages the reduction of environmental pollution and disclosure of new energy and transportation technologies from our classified military industrial complex black projects. These technologies would make combustion of hydrocarbon fuels obsolete but also destroy the backing of our currency / economic system by reducing the value of the petrol-dollar. Oil is the only commodity propping up our US currency today which is why we don‚Äôt see the disclosure and adoption of new technologies that have already been invented.\n\nPlease, please, please educate yourselves with the truth.

But anyway, I googled your text including quotes, thanks. When I look into things in detail, I find statements like \"Climate change and pesticides appear to be the main causes of this significant decline.\" Words like \"appear to be\" mean they don't know. Pesticides, yes, I understand that. Roundup for example might be responsible for bees dying off. But that's pesticides, not climate change. So, you seem reasonable. If you looked through some of those results, what's a single really good example that is definitely from climate change?\n\n\n¬†I'm afraid the reality is that any die-offs are really from population growth, 220,000 new people on earth every day, or about 80 million per year, not climate change. They say warming has been only 0.85 degrees C since 1880 (over 140 years). So, I hope you can see that my intent here is good. We have to talk about the real reason for the harms happening or we cannot really do any good and would lose logical intelligent people if we rely on falsehoods in the mere hope that emotional fears are going to do the trick in manipulating people.

{"cid": "UgwiMko0tvH5vR0C5vx4AaABAg", "text": "CO2 is what plants breathe. Greenhouses on farms are pumped full of CO2 because it makes the crops grow faster, bigger, and with more nutrients. Corn has been hitting all time highs for yields for the last 5 years according to NOAA's raw data sets. When the first explosion of life happened on Earth there was over 7000ppm CO2 in the atmosphere. Today we are around 400. Almost 20 times less. More CO2 means more oxygen which means more thriving life and more plants. That is a real snowball affect, unlike the \"greenhouse affect.\" It is estimated by some scientists such as Dr. Patrick Moore that if we go below 150ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration, then all plant life will be unable to survive. We hit the lowest that we ever have in recent history, (past 500 years) and we are still on the extremely low end for atmospheric CO2 concentration. There is no downside to atmospheric CO2. In fact it is what keeps all life on Earth alive. And fossil fuels keep all of us alive when it gets too hot or too cold outside. It is what allows us to live with luxuries in life instead of like cavemen. \n\n\nThe amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is controlled by the temperature. Not the other way around. When your water soda or beer gets warmer, more CO2 bubbles form and rise to the surface and are released into the atmosphere. Antarctic ice core data shows that CO2 levels and temperature have been parallel for the past 450,000 years. But CO2 lags temperature by 800 years. This is because of the heat cycles in the ocean. CO2 has a greenhouse affect on 3 electromagnetic radiation wavelengths. Water vapor has a greenhouse affect on more than 50, including the 3 that CO2 also has a possible affect on. All of those 3 wavelengths are already being held in the atmosphere. More CO2 will have a practically unnoticeable affect, if any. \n\n\nNOAA and NASA's current graphs and published data sets go against their previous data and raw data sets. The difference between a raw data set and a published one is that the raw data set is the pure data. It has not been altered or changed at all. The newer published data sets have more than 50% of the raw data replaced with either algorithm generated data or simply human inputted numbers, and they show the opposite of what the raw data shows. \n\n\nNone of the predictions of these \"scientists\" have come true, and anyone can take a look outside and see that these wild claims about \"60% of wildlife has been killed since 1970\" or \"Snow will be a thing of the past by 2020\" are completely false. Anyone can go to a legitimate organisation such as the DMI (Danish Meteorological Institute) and look at real data that goes completely against what groups with corrupt management say. Or they can take a look at NOAA's maps and raw data sets. Alaska is not having record heat right now like the media are reporting. It is -65% in some places there right now. The forecasts are all available online. \n\n\nClimate models from climate \"scientists\" have never been needed, because we have geologists and paleontologists. They know the history of the earth and have studied what happens during circumstances such as the current one today. We do not need these predictions, because we already have data that has fairly closely repeated itself, and laws based on that data. That is how you do science, data.

{"cid": "UgzdyRABHZe75G4yJAt4AaABAg", "text": "Hmm...as one point of criticism; re the comment about the Arctic having lost 36 cubic miles of ice in a 4-yr period (2002-2005) - that amounts to a frightening(?-?) one ten millionth(!) of the volume of the ocean, (over 330 million cubic miles of it) and since that stated loss is massively within the normal, fluctuant annual gain/loss cycles of the Arctic ice, which has gained a good deal more than it lost in the last three years, and as the Arctic comprises about 10% of the ice on the poles, the 36 cubic miles of loss (since more than gained back) does not exactly terrify me...give us some context please! Meanwhile the Antarctic, a far more important frozen entity, appears to be accrueing net ice gains in most recent years, especially in its eastern portions, which comprise 98% of its 90% share in the global polar ice budget....Seas are \"not\" showing an increased \"rate\" (key operative word) during any time since we have had tide gages in place. The seas are rising, yes, that is all we have seen them do curing our competent observation window, but at the same millimeter or two a year rate that we have been observing since the 1880's....that Nye is still marching out the bogus 97% \"consensus\", (a word not to applied to scientific conclusions, and generated from shamefully corrupted data inputs from an Aussie's (Cook) mere Master's thesis) and simplifying if not bastardizing alleged, significant CO2 greenhouse effects works great in a 10-gallon, closed system aquarium tank) as one of about 17 climatic inputs to be considered - well it is just hard to take his points of argument seriously.

I am taking a geology class and looking at geological records almost never has change ever happened at the rates we see now without some crazy cataclysm like a mass extinction happening. The problem is how accurately we can calculate this change in the past, which is not easy. Its not easy but looking at what can be causing today's rapid temperature change and the possible causes humans are the most likely. As this guy said in the video the planets orbit usually was the major factor for past warming and cooling but we can directly observe the current orbit of the planet and see that it is not what is causing it at least not to this extent. We can look at geological events like valcanism\nand see it been relatively stable and the other factors are mostly human related. Am i saying we are dooming the planet? No, but the fact we do have an impact is not really debatable if you just look at the data for yourself. The NASA GISS data is a good place to start as well as looking at geological data to compare to the past.\n\n\nForm your own conclusion rather if you dont trust this guy and unless your dad is reasonably educated in science in general take his word with caution. The worry isnt really about the warming to me but if the ice caps melt will they ever come back and thats hard to say. Its very possible they wont if we keep our pollution output.

That's just me arguing semantics though. SO2 (sulfur dioxide) and H2So4 (sulfuric acid) are the major causes of IR absorption on Venus.\n\n\nFor earth in the past the temperature change was primarily caused by changes in the earth orbit. The lag is because CO2 is both a cause and effect of warming and other factors. For times when the earth was cold and had high CO2 levels you have to ask can the CO2 offset the orbital  or other effect? Just because it was present in high levels during a time of glacial maximum does not mean it isn't a factor in temperature. Again you have to ask was there something that could offset its effect.\n\n\nToday CO2 is not lagging temperature change and the CO2 levels are not naturally rising if you look at the rates we see today. This is the human factor.  I would like to see where the 0.01% human influence comes from and what all was factored in to come to that conclusion. It sounds like its a measure of hundreds or thousands of years to marginalize the current human influence. Would have to see the data to know for sure though. Like saying I have 100% greater income today or I have 0.01% greater income.

{"cid": "UgwSt9qCj3ccoz9EHah4AaABAg.9-c3PUflCj_91eRmbH5Cu1", "text": "¬†@Mark s¬† More CO2 DOES make plants grow faster in a greenhouse in the short run, but on a global level it has catastrophic long-term ripple effects--including for crops and forests and the oceans. As I taught one of my classes recently, the long-term harmful effects of rapidly adding much  more CO2 include global warming of the land, atmosphere, and especially oceans; rapid and accelerating melting of the Earth‚Äôs ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels (very slow at first but increasingly catastrophic), growing shortages of freshwater for drinking and irrigation affecting billions of people, more intense droughts, floods, and wildfires; and more air pollution and related human health problems due to more intense forest fires.  \r\n\r\nThe overly-optimistic folks who claim that global greening from more CO2 apparently don‚Äôt know that with the greening, weeds tend to really benefit, and with the warming you get more harm to crops and forests from insects, fungi, and disease; grain crops have already lost 5-8% or more of key nutrients due to more CO2 and will continue to lose more, and the amount of sugars in grain crops will continue to rise. Lower nutrient content and higher sugar content in our foods just feeds the crisis of obesity and related diseases, driving up health care costs further. Also, more CO2 means plants will grow thicker leaves and need more water due to increased CO2 (this will intensify water shortages as 70-80% of freshwater is used for agriculture/food production). The more intense droughts and floods creates problems for many farmers, and the range where certain crops can be grown efficiently has moved towards the poles by 100 miles or more already: Unfortunately, there is less land near the poles than in the fatter middle of the Earth, and the land up there often hasn‚Äôt had time or opportunity (permafrost) to develop really rich topsoil. Thus, while more CO2 can increase crop growth at first, as warming and all the other ripple effects kick in, crops get more stressed and struggle: Thus, a recent study expects 60% of the global wheat crop to be threatened by 2100. \r\n\r\nMore CO2 and the warming it causes also means the spread of human disease as the ‚Äútropics‚Äù and its mosquito-borne diseases expand by 30 miles a decade, while melting permafrost has unleased other diseases long-frozen in the ice (e.g., anthrax). \r\n\r\nThen there‚Äôs the warming-caused mass die-offs of coral reefs and the fish and other aquatic life that depend on them, the increasing drying of America from west to east, the slowing of ocean currents with ripple effects for climate (already beginning) and increasing the size of dead zones in the ocean, the collapse of ecosystems on land (permafrost region, drying of the Amazon) and sea (decline/collapse of coral reefs and fish populations, polar ecosystem heading for collapse as ‚Äúcold-enough‚Äù areas disappear), sea snails at the bottom of the food chain having their shells dissolve at much higher rates because of the more acidic oceans, other shellfish having a harder time building shells, and thus being 30-50% smaller than normal), almost all green sea turtles are now being born female (because gender is regulated by the temperature of the sand at that time of year). \r\n\r\nMore CO2 rapid die-offs of species related to the above‚Äîincluding the disappearance of 40% of the plankton population since the 1950s, increasing crop failures due to the above, increasingly-worsening refugees crises due to the above, increasingly staggering mitigation and repair costs due to the above, and increasing political and social instability and violence and resource conflicts/wars (already happening) due to all of the above. The chain reactions are vastly worse than you have ever been told‚Äîtruly catastrophic in the long run, leading (if we don‚Äôt take rapid action) to the collapse of ecosystems, our food supply, and our civilization and population. I don‚Äôt know, but I do know that very few scientists know all of these destructively cascading ripple effects because most don‚Äôt read much outside of their specialty. P.S. I didn‚Äôt even include all of those ripple effects.\r\n\r\nSo, if you are watching videos and reading on websites that ‚ÄúHey, more CO2 is great‚Äîit‚Äôs plant food,‚Äù I want to know why aren‚Äôt these folks aren‚Äôt telling you the WHOLE story? Why are they only telling you about 1% of the changes rapidly increasing CO2 levels will cause, and leaving out the other 99%.  Is it because they don‚Äôt know the whole story? That may be  understandable‚ÄîI only know all this because I‚Äôve been researching for more than 10 years on a book about what we need to do to protect and heal society and the planet. However, some of these harms have been well-publicized, so if these people are scientifically literate, they should know about them. Another possibility regarding some of the site/sources that gleefully declare ‚ÄúCO2 is plant food!‚Äù is that they are PAID to spread propaganda like pretending more CO2 is all good news. After all, the fossil fuels companies have been spending $200 million or more a year to spread propaganda to confuse people, and they may have funded the folks that provided some of the information you heard. \r\n\r\nTake care.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxHkqrUIALT-Heb52x4AaABAg.9-arXCo9i5Z91eRATAzSBJ", "text": "Yes, you are right more CO2 increases plant growth, but at a global level, it's catastrophic. As I taught one of my classes recently, the long-term harmful effects of rapidly adding much  more CO2 include global warming of the land, atmosphere, and especially oceans; rapid and accelerating melting of the Earth‚Äôs ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels (very slow at first but increasingly catastrophic), growing shortages of freshwater for drinking and irrigation affecting billions of people, more intense droughts, floods, and wildfires; and more air pollution and related human health problems due to more intense forest fires.  \r\n\r\nThe overly-optimistic folks who claim that global greening from more CO2 apparently don‚Äôt know that with the greening, weeds tend to really benefit, and with the warming you get more harm to crops and forests from insects, fungi, and disease; grain crops have already lost 5-8% or more of key nutrients due to more CO2 and will continue to lose more, and the amount of sugars in grain crops will continue to rise. Lower nutrient content and higher sugar content in our foods just feeds the crisis of obesity and related diseases, driving up health care costs further. Also, more CO2 means plants will grow thicker leaves and need more water due to increased CO2 (this will intensify water shortages as 70-80% of freshwater is used for agriculture/food production). The more intense droughts and floods creates problems for many farmers, and the range where certain crops can be grown efficiently has moved towards the poles by 100 miles or more already: Unfortunately, there is less land near the poles than in the fatter middle of the Earth, and the land up there often hasn‚Äôt had time or opportunity (permafrost) to develop really rich topsoil. Thus, while more CO2 can increase crop growth at first, as warming and all the other ripple effects kick in, crops get more stressed and struggle: Thus, a recent study expects 60% of the global wheat crop to be threatened by 2100. \r\n\r\nMore CO2 and the warming it causes also means the spread of human disease as the ‚Äútropics‚Äù and its mosquito-borne diseases expand by 30 miles a decade, while melting permafrost has unleased other diseases long-frozen in the ice (e.g., anthrax). \r\n\r\nThen there‚Äôs the warming-caused mass die-offs of coral reefs and the fish and other aquatic life that depend on them, the increasing drying of America from west to east, the slowing of ocean currents with ripple effects for climate (already beginning) and increasing the size of dead zones in the ocean, the collapse of ecosystems on land (permafrost region, drying of the Amazon) and sea (decline/collapse of coral reefs and fish populations, polar ecosystem heading for collapse as ‚Äúcold-enough‚Äù areas disappear), sea snails at the bottom of the food chain having their shells dissolve at much higher rates because of the more acidic oceans, other shellfish having a harder time building shells, and thus being 30-50% smaller than normal), almost all green sea turtles are now being born female (because gender is regulated by the temperature of the sand at that time of year). \r\n\r\nMore CO2 rapid die-offs of species related to the above‚Äîincluding the disappearance of 40% of the plankton population since the 1950s, increasing crop failures due to the above, increasingly-worsening refugees crises due to the above, increasingly staggering mitigation and repair costs due to the above, and increasing political and social instability and violence and resource conflicts/wars (already happening) due to all of the above. The chain reactions are vastly worse than you have ever been told‚Äîtruly catastrophic in the long run, leading (if we don‚Äôt take rapid action) to the collapse of ecosystems, our food supply, and our civilization and population. I don‚Äôt know, but I do know that very few scientists know all of these destructively cascading ripple effects because most don‚Äôt read much outside of their specialty. P.S. I didn‚Äôt even include all of those ripple effects.\r\n\r\nSo, if you are watching videos and reading on websites that ‚ÄúHey, more CO2 is great‚Äîit‚Äôs plant food,‚Äù I want to know why aren‚Äôt these folks aren‚Äôt telling you the WHOLE story? Why are they only telling you about 1% of the changes rapidly increasing CO2 levels will cause, and leaving out the other 99%.  Is it because they don‚Äôt know the whole story? That may be  understandable‚ÄîI only know all this because I‚Äôve been researching for more than 10 years on a book about what we need to do to protect and heal society and the planet. However, some of these harms have been well-publicized, so if these people are scientifically literate, they should know about them. Another possibility regarding some of the site/sources that gleefully declare ‚ÄúCO2 is plant food!‚Äù is that they are PAID to spread propaganda like pretending more CO2 is all good news. After all, the fossil fuels companies have been spending $200 million or more a year to spread propaganda to confuse people, and they may have funded the folks that provided some of the information you heard. \r\n\r\nTake care.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgytgnwxiQPQuip-Z_V4AaABAg", "text": "Unique philosophical perspective on Anthropogenic Climate Change \n\n\nI think that human-induced climate catastrophe and this mass extinction Era-changing event is expected, correct and it couldn‚Äôt be more appropriate for the story of this planet.  Based on the unavoidable, existential, and cycled principles of  development, decay, renovation, and change. It won‚Äôt be stopped, it cant be stopped, and it shouldn‚Äôt be ordained too. The collapse of the Cenozoic era will be a bullet-fast death in the geological timescale, like a comet impact. A Shakespearean natural story of a Geologic Era structurally driven towards the ultimate specialization of complex mammalian life. Culminating in the circumstantial but inevitable evolution of a mammalian species that achieved animal sentience and that in an split of a second developed itself beyond life‚Äôs wildest dreams, covering the earth with its technological hive structures that consumed the planet‚Äôs biosphere like a fungal parasitic entity multiplying out of control, killing itself (as a supermassive social structure) and wiping most species from existence. A story of aspiration and the beautiful cost of arrogance, that reached far enough to touch godhood but fell like the melted wings of Icarus, taking the whole ecosphere structure down with it in a spectacular extinction event. We are a territorial and tribe structures species with decentralized social structures that are unavoidably in competition with each other, as  defined by the characteristics our species we are incapable of pulling off the simultaneous cohesive global effort to correct climate change. Thinking that we can is wishful thinking and it foolishly ignores the primal fundamental characteristics that define us as a species. The sixth extinction will be the womb upon which the new geologic era of life will be born. Life will recover and renovate its evolutionary focus in another direction. Just like the apocalyptic end of the Mesozoic and the extinction of the dinosaurs was necessary to give way to the Cenozoic era of  mammals and to us, and we are its crescendo and ultimate conclusion. Anthropogenic Climate Change as a cataclysmically-fast planet deteriorating  event is the most fitting end for us and our evolutive era. It might be ugly or painful for our own animalistic interpretation, which is dominated by emotions and instincts. And it might be tragic and sad for other species. But nature is not empathic, it never has been.  So Climate Change  isn‚Äôt bad or good, it just is. It fits wondrously with the structures of existence. Atoms fuse and decay, organism are born develop die and decompose, humans grow in their youth, develop into old age and die. All societies and empires have risen, reached a zenith, declined and fallen, new societies borrow from the ashes of old ones. Species go extinct and evolve into new creations. In a billion years this planet will return to the primal lifeless heat from which it came. Our star will expand and explode our solar system will die, new solar systems will be created with material from ours within them. The universe born with a bang will continue to expand and change, decay and simplify its structures and darken until in an unimaginable scale of time the laws of physics themselves fade and cease to exist. These cycles and  structured paths of development on all scales are the defining condition of spacetime existence  and are therefore unavoidable, it is futile to resist them, and it‚Äôs okay to face and accept them.", "time": "2 years ago (edited)", "author": "gabo1841997", "channel": "UCSS5yut6HpE4ITvGRWPwayQ", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRsjS8eeZSbncGgU04ucVH_uC9RbOui2GTF3w=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgxD8PZlrY_yKuznBAZ4AaABAg.8yxVxzmuPoL91etZ3CUBAN", "text": "\"I need evidence before Bill will panic me!\" Here's part 2\nAs I taught one of my classes recently, the long-term harmful effects of rapidly adding much  more CO2 include global warming of the land, atmosphere, and especially oceans; rapid and accelerating melting of the Earth‚Äôs ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels (very slow at first but increasingly catastrophic), growing shortages of freshwater for drinking and irrigation affecting billions of people, more intense droughts, floods, and wildfires; and more air pollution and related human health problems due to more intense forest fires.  \r\n\r\nThe overly-optimistic folks who claim that global greening from more CO2 apparently don‚Äôt know that with the greening, weeds tend to really benefit, and with the warming you get more harm to crops and forests from insects, fungi, and disease; grain crops have already lost 5-8% or more of key nutrients due to more CO2 and will continue to lose more, and the amount of sugars in grain crops will continue to rise. Lower nutrient content and higher sugar content in our foods just feeds the crisis of obesity and related diseases, driving up health care costs further. Also, more CO2 means plants will grow thicker leaves and need more water due to increased CO2 (this will intensify water shortages as 70-80% of freshwater is used for agriculture/food production). The more intense droughts and floods creates problems for many farmers, and the range where certain crops can be grown efficiently has moved towards the poles by 100 miles or more already: Unfortunately, there is less land near the poles than in the fatter middle of the Earth, and the land up there often hasn‚Äôt had time or opportunity (permafrost) to develop really rich topsoil. Thus, while more CO2 can increase crop growth at first, as warming and all the other ripple effects kick in, crops get more stressed and struggle: Thus, a recent study expects 60% of the global wheat crop to be threatened by 2100. \r\n\r\nMore CO2 and the warming it causes also means the spread of human disease as the ‚Äútropics‚Äù and its mosquito-borne diseases expand by 30 miles a decade, while melting permafrost has unleased other diseases long-frozen in the ice (e.g., anthrax). \r\n\r\nThen there‚Äôs the warming-caused mass die-offs of coral reefs and the fish and other aquatic life that depend on them, the increasing drying of America from west to east, the slowing of ocean currents with ripple effects for climate (already beginning) and increasing the size of dead zones in the ocean, the collapse of ecosystems on land (permafrost region, drying of the Amazon) and sea (decline/collapse of coral reefs and fish populations, polar ecosystem heading for collapse as ‚Äúcold-enough‚Äù areas disappear), sea snails at the bottom of the food chain having their shells dissolve at much higher rates because of the more acidic oceans, other shellfish having a harder time building shells, and thus being 30-50% smaller than normal), almost all green sea turtles are now being born female (because gender is regulated by the temperature of the sand at that time of year). \r\n\r\nMore CO2 rapid die-offs of species related to the above‚Äîincluding the disappearance of 40% of the plankton population since the 1950s, increasing crop failures due to the above, increasingly-worsening refugees crises due to the above, increasingly staggering mitigation and repair costs due to the above, and increasing political and social instability and violence and resource conflicts/wars (already happening) due to all of the above. The chain reactions are vastly worse than you have ever been told‚Äîtruly catastrophic in the long run, leading (if we don‚Äôt take rapid action) to the collapse of ecosystems, our food supply, and our civilization and population. I don‚Äôt know, but I do know that very few scientists know all of these destructively cascading ripple effects because most don‚Äôt read much outside of their specialty. P.S. I didn‚Äôt even include all of those ripple effects.\r\n\r\nSo, if you are watching videos and reading on websites that ‚ÄúHey, more CO2 is great‚Äîit‚Äôs plant food,‚Äù I want to know why aren‚Äôt these folks aren‚Äôt telling you the WHOLE story? Why are they only telling you about 1% of the changes rapidly increasing CO2 levels will cause, and leaving out the other 99%.  Is it because they don‚Äôt know the whole story? That may be  understandable‚ÄîI only know all this because I‚Äôve been researching for more than 10 years on a book about what we need to do to protect and heal society and the planet. However, some of these harms have been well-publicized, so if these people are scientifically literate, they should know about them. Another possibility regarding some of the site/sources that gleefully declare ‚ÄúCO2 is plant food!‚Äù is that they are PAID to spread propaganda like pretending more CO2 is all good news. After all, the fossil fuels companies have been spending $200 million or more a year to spread propaganda to confuse people, and they may have funded the folks that provided some of the information you heard. \r\n\r\nTake care.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Karl Wheatley", "channel": "UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRHGMcRQN4QSrcpKWPOEUomRXk6tzT05nE5yQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "UgyHgGW5CtnHY7njEil4AaABAg", "text": "GLOBAL WARMING\nFor several years the amount of pollution and Co2 being put into the air is increasing everyday. This creates global warming. Global warming causes wildfires, water rises, and an increase of heat. It is our fault for fueling this with pollution, deforestation, and our lack of trying to change the situation. Global warming has significant effects on the health of the planet and us as a species.\n\nTo start this off, forests are affected by global warming in reason of more pollution, means more heat from global warming, meaning less rain, equalling to dry forests waiting for destruction. In an article called ‚ÄúIs Global Warming Fueling Increased Wildfire Risks?‚Äù it states ‚ÄúAs the climate warms, moisture and precipitation levels are changing, with wet areas becoming wetter and dry areas becoming direr They also said ‚Äú...hot, dry conditions also increase the likelihood that, once wildfires are started by lightning strikes or human error, they will be more intense and long-burning.‚Äù. This shows how global warming sets up forests like matches ready to be ignited by us, or naturally.This shows that global warming is causing dryness in the air, and that is a key element to fire. To add on, deforestation and wildfires means less trees to balance Co2 for less global warming, and wildfires are mostly caused naturally or by us. \n\n Not only that but also, due to global warming the polar ice caps are melting and causing waters to rise and flood areas. In an article called ‚ÄúAre the Effects of Global Warming Really That Bad?‚Äù states ‚ÄúThe polar regions are particularly vulnerable to a warming atmosphere‚Äù...‚ÄùThis not only has grave consequences for the regions, people, wildlife, and plants; its most serious impact may be on rising sea levels. By 2100, it‚Äôs estimated our oceans will be one to four feet higher, threatening coastal systems and low-lying areas,‚Äù This shows that hat is an enemy to ice. The higher we let global warming to do this, beaches will overflow land area causing people to go the hills andhigher land. To add on, when the water rises, we have less land to live on like places in California, San Francisco, Japan or ‚Äúother close to the beach‚Äù areas.\n\n Although this may be true, others think global warming is a myth or a debatable subject not yet proved. To a website called ‚Äúfriends of science‚Äù it states ‚ÄúCarbon dioxide levels have indeed changed for various reasons, humans and otherwise, just as they thought geological time...However, there is no proof that Co2 is the main driver of global warming.‚Äù They also said ‚ÄúThere is no scientific evidence whatsoever that supports such claims on a global scale. Regional variations may occur.‚Äù This shows how people may have thought global warming isn‚Äôt real, and maybe said we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have evidence‚Äù because people haven‚Äôt seen real problems yet. These people believe it‚Äôs not global, as in some places because they think its in some places instead of a global scale, however if they keep believing that until something bad happens it might be too late to fix this.\n \nThe increased activity on pollution being put into the air causes disasters such as wildfires, water rises and heat. We fuel this with deforestation, smoking and pollution.

Though innovation itself cannot be argued as it overall improves life quality and human interaction nationally and internationally... Has anyone possibility thought of the real solution being population control? I know it is an old saying that humans are meant to \"be fruitful and multiply\", but that was, like many social beliefs, based off what I remember from religion class. I believe the movement towards eliminating animal agriculture should be as equal as the possibility of controlling the amount of children a person can conceive. Of course this idea is completely undeveloped and could be another dud, but I do think overpopulation has a direct link with exhausting resources; this leading to methods to find or take/ steal or create more to feed the overpopulating world. Most of these methods being detrimental to the environment. I don't know, I just think there should just be more thought into limiting (I'm not saying eliminating) procreating, as its those generations that'll be affected in the end.

So an essential life gas that just happpens to be directly tied to industry is causing global warming. How about in 1980s when temperature dropped below average. Did we quit making co2 for awhile in the 80s. Nope. How about the fact that the sun on what scentist think is and 8000 year high, also how about that CO2 is not even a good greenhouse gas. Methane and many others are much more powerful, I mean this is a gas that is essential to life. Plants cannot even live with out it, CO2 global warming dose not even make sense. What do u think has more power over temperature a trace necessary for life gas or the sun its a no brainier. So why then  brain wash ppl to believe this. Well government wants power more than anything and how else do keep the poor of world poor deny them industry. How do u keep the population in debit, tax a gas that essential for life and one that we must produce to live. I honestly think they said well we cant tax water so why not the very air we breathe. Then they took the scientist, which i challenge u to find a climate scientist whos research does not rely on government grants to push this issue on us and We are all just so dumb we except it as facts. We been studying climate for 100 years the Earth is billions of years old we know nothing of its long term cycles but what a good  why to force centralized world government and keep third world countries out of the global economy.

There is still so much debate on the true effect, for example what increase in temperature is there per 10 ppm of CO2?  They have no clue...  the Arctic is losing ice, the Antarctic is gaining.  The last 10 of the 18 years are hottest on record, by 1/10-1/100 of a degree, statistically no difference.  If you walked up a mountain and the top was an 18 mile plateau, every mile would be record breaking height... the only true issue I see is ocean acidification, but overfishing and issues related to meat consumption are much worse problems.

All of the things happening weather wise is because the Earth itself is out of balance. Industrialists have sucked so such out of the Earth that it is in drastic repair mode but GREED will not allow them to see that. We are the ones who are killing ourselves with consumerism. Deforestation, pulling the metals out of the Earth to make conveniences are causing massive sinkholes, plastic products are being dumped into the ocean as well as being dumped in other countries. The U.S. and Europe are dumping their plastic waste all over the other countries in order that we don't have to live in the filth that they are forcing other countries to live in in order to get some money to keep their countries going. It is so horrifically wrong and sad.

{"cid": "Ugi7SVEOS3Stw3gCoAEC", "text": "A sizable piece of the Antarctic Ice Shelf (50Km X 100Km) is about to break away and drift off. Ah Global Warming you say, but I was listening to David Vaughan (Director of Science, British Antarctic Survey) being interviewed on BBC world service's Science In Action. \n\nThere is a research station on the ice shelf called Halley VI which they are/have moved so that it doesn't float away. Dr Vaughan has this responsibility! \n\nBut when asked if this should be taken as another signal of climate change he said it was probably a mistake to do so. I was rather stunned at what he said which is this: \"AT HALLEY WE HAVE MEASURED THE TEMPERATURES FOR 50 YEARS. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THIS AREA\" he went on to say this in contrast to the Arctic Peninsula (other end of the world) which has demonstrated recent rapid warming.\n\nMy point is this: The more the global warming believers say the evidence is irrefutable, and all one way, the more the doubters will point out that this is patently not true. And so each polarized camp becomes more, and more firmly entrenched.\n\nWith systems as complex as world climate, and with the massive quantities of data we are collecting on these systems, you can ALWAYS find evidence to support your own particular political/ philosophical/ religious/ economic/ scientific persecutive. This is a problem.\n\nIf we are going to find a solution all entrenched camps need to look seriously at the arguments of their opponents, rather than just shouting abuse and slander at them.

How did we enter those periods, and also how did we exit them? Camp fires and body heat? Clearly, before an Ice Age there was fair weather with blue skies and normal sea levels. Then the earth froze, and then it melted. This all happened before humans existed. Currently our earth has fair weather with blue skies and normal sea levels. I can assume that it will not be like this forever. I like to look at the facts and I am not judging people's opinion, but I have a hard time trusting someone who can't tell me what the weather will be in 3 weeks, let alone tell me that the earth's gradual rise in temperature is a serious and bad thing. If we all step back and look at our complex earth, we must admit to ourselves that the earth has gone through extreme high and low temperatures all on its' own for billions of years now. As I am writing this comment, the sun can produce a giant heat wave and raise the temperature of the earth in drastic levels.

Reality will overtake population that\ndestroys what keeps it alive leading to starvation death suffering\ndemise of 97% of any population to start again to\nclimb mate and change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27 - You should note that Climate Change is\nwestern industrial European cultural addiction¬† it is not from\nAboriginal tribal indigenous traditional cultures that have existed\nfor either thousands or¬† as in\nAustralian groups\nfor more than 40 000 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28 -

{"cid": "UgjEr2yNzT_ExngCoAEC.8S4jq5-56PQ93bCnZ1C17J", "text": "‚Äã¬†@Ophir Wesley¬† As an actual member of the \"scientific community\" you talk about, and a person who has studied with and learned from some greats of the \"scientific community\" I disagree and will explain some basic science of the greenhouse affect and CO2's relation to temperature. Then I will talk about some of what I have personally seen happen in these \"scientific\" groups that push this propaganda.\n\n\nCO2 is what plants breathe. Greenhouses on farms are pumped full of CO2 because it makes the crops grow faster, bigger, and with more nutrients. Corn has been hitting all time highs for yields for the last 5 years according to NOAA's raw data sets. When we believe the first explosion of life happened on Earth there was over 7000ppm CO2 in the atmosphere. Today we are around 400. Almost 20 times less. More CO2 means more oxygen which means more thriving life and more plants. That is a real snowball affect, unlike the \"greenhouse affect.\" It is estimated by some scientists such as Dr. Patrick Moore that if we go below 150ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration, then all plant life will be unable to survive. We hit the lowest that we ever have in recent history, (past 500 years) and we are still on the extremely low end for atmospheric CO2 concentration. There is no downside to atmospheric CO2. In fact it is what keeps all life on Earth alive. And fossil fuels keep all of us alive when it gets too hot or too cold outside. It is what allows us to live with luxuries in life instead of like cavemen. \r\n\r\nThe amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is controlled by the temperature. Not the other way around. When your water soda or beer gets warmer, more CO2 bubbles form and rise to the surface and are released into the atmosphere. Antarctic ice core data shows that CO2 levels and temperature have been parallel for the past 450,000 years. But CO2 lags temperature by 800 years. This is because of how heat cycles in the ocean. CO2 has a greenhouse affect on 3 electromagnetic radiation wavelengths. Water vapor has a greenhouse affect on more than 50, including the 3 that CO2 also has a possible affect on. All of those 3 wavelengths are already being held in the atmosphere. More CO2 will have a practically unnoticeable affect, if any. \r\n\r\nNOAA and NASA's current graphs and published data sets go against their previous data and raw data sets. The difference between a raw data set and a published one is that the raw data set is the pure data. It has not been altered or changed at all. The newer published data sets have more than 50% of the raw data replaced with either algorithm generated data or simply human inputted numbers, and they show the opposite of what the raw data shows. \rAnyone who gets government funding or works for these groups that push the propaganda is not allowed to speak out against global warming or they will lose their funding and their job. If these so called \"heretics\" get fairly well known, then they get whole websites devoted just to slandering them.\n\r\nNone of the predictions of these \"scientists\" have come true, and anyone can take a look outside and see that these wild claims about \"60% of wildlife has been killed since 1970\" or \"Snow will be a thing of the past by 2020\" or \"40% of greenland has melted in summer 2019\" or \"NYC will be underwater by 2014\" are completely false. Anyone can go to a legitimate organisation such as the DMI (Danish Meteorological Institute) and look at real data that goes completely against what groups with corrupt management say. Or they can take a look at NOAA's maps and raw data sets. Alaska is not having record heat right now like the media are reporting. It was -65 degrees in some places in the past week. The forecasts are all available online.\n\r\nClimate models from climate \"scientists\" have never been needed, because we have geologists and paleontologists. They know the history of the earth and have studied what happens during circumstances very similar to the current one today. We do not need these predictions, because we already have data that has fairly closely repeated itself, and laws based on that data. That is how you do science, data. You adjust theories to match the data. You do not adjust data to match your theories, that is not science, that is fraud. All of what I say has been preached by real scientists for decades, and the actual number of scientists that believe in global warming is around 3%. Not 97%. Go and check everything I have said at the sources I have cited. The official government sources that the global warming believers preach. The only difference is that I do not listen to their PR departments or management. I look at the data and the scientists who quietly do their job gathering it.", "time": "1 year ago", "author": "Matt Kaye", "channel": "UCeM8-GgAbWXQJEnZWyH14RA", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTuDDL6usZBDZqsVcW2Cg-T8_C60kMz8yXUsw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

Here it is again by popular request;\nHeat Waves: Dr. Judith Curry, Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology offered Senate testimony on January 16, 2014. She showed an analysis of 982 stations from the U.S. Historical Climate Network for the 48 continental states with more than 80 years of record. The data show a strong peak of record maximum daily temperatures occurred in the 1930s, with no increasing trend in the post-WWII years when CO2 started its modern increase.\nOf the 50 states, the number of state maximum record temperatures obtained from NOAA‚Äôs National Climate Data Center, by decade, shows that in the 1930s, 23 states set their all-time high temperatures, by far the largest number of such record highs. There has not been a single state record maximum set in the 21st Century.\nDroughts: The most-often used indicator of drought is the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Curry‚Äôs testimony included a PDSI chart, showing the most severe droughts in the 102-year record 1910-2012, were in the 1930s and a lesser maximum in the 1950s. Data show no indication that drought severity has increased as CO2 has increased.\nFloods: Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr., from the University of Colorado, testified to the Senate EPW Committee on July 18, 2013. With respect to floods, he provided data from the US Geological Survey, which show in the U.S., floods have not increased in frequency or intensity since at least 1950, and that flood losses, as a percentage of GDP have dropped by about 75% since 1940, based on data from NOAA‚Äôs Hydrologic Information Center.\nSomerville says that increasing CO2 will harm plant productivity, but the opposite is true. First, realize that both plants and animals, including humans, are carbon-based life forms. With increasing CO2, there is an incredible array of beneficial effects spelled out in the book, The Many Benefits of Atmospheric CO2 Enrichment, by Craig Idso and Sherman Idso. The benefits include: increasing water-use efficiency; increasing biomass in roots, stems, flowers and nectar; larger seeds; avoiding human starvation and plant and animal extinctions; stimulating early plant growth; and resistance to plant diseases.

Remember this is all data collected since the 70's which is not a long time. The ice caps over the tens of millennia have been expanding and retracting due to solar energy output, volcanism and many other variables. As of now, the Arctic Cap is experiencing a string of record warm winters, and around average summers; this obviously is going to make it shrink. On the other hand, at a slower pace but still substantial, the Antarctic cap has been growing over the past few decades, due to very cold winters and around average summers. I'm always trying to research what is really going on with the caps because I'm not a believer in human climate change. I think what has been going on with the caps retreating has been in place since the ice age. I'm a believer in respecting the environment.

{"cid": "UghaJv_rmQ2ExHgCoAEC.8O7qHvd8zIR8OQACMIOujE", "text": "Human activity--such as burning fossil fuels--causes more greenhouse gases to build up in the atmosphere. As the atmosphere \"thickens\" with more greenhouse gases, more heat is held in. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are high in carbon and, when burned, produce major amounts of carbon dioxide or CO2. A single gallon of gasoline, when burned, puts 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe role of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in warming the Earth's surface was first demonstrated by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius more than 100 years ago. Scientific data have since established that, for hundreds of thousands of years, changes in temperature have closely tracked with atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Since the Industrial Revolution, the burning of coal, oil and natural gas has emitted roughly 500 billion tons of CO2, about half of which remains in the atmosphere. This CO2 is the biggest factor responsible for recent warming trends.\n\nAn annual State of the Climate report has confirmed that 2015 surpassed 2014 as the warmest year on record since at least the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\nLast year‚Äôs record heat resulted from a combination of long-term global warming and one of the strongest El Ni√±o experienced since at least 1950, according to the more than 450 scientists that contributed to the report. They found that most indicators of climate change continued to reflect trends consistent with a global warming.   \n\nNotable findings from the report include:\n\nGreenhouse gases were the highest on record. Major greenhouse gas concentrations, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide, rose to new record high values during 2015. The 2015 average global CO2 concentration was 399.4 parts per million (ppm), an increase of 2.2 ppm compared with 2014.\n\nGlobal surface temperature was the highest on record. Aided by the strong El Ni√±o, the 2015 annual global surface temperature was 0.76‚Äì0.83 degrees F (0.42¬∞‚Äì0.46¬∞C) above the 1981‚Äì2010 average, surpassing the previous record set in 2014.\n\nSea surface temperature was the highest on record. The globally averaged sea surface temperature was 0.59‚Äì0.70 degrees F (0.33¬∞‚Äì0.39¬∞C) above average, breaking the previous mark set in 2014.\n\nGlobal upper ocean heat content highest on record. Upper ocean heat content exceeded the record set in 2014, reflecting the continuing accumulation of heat in the ocean‚Äôs top layers.  \n\nGlobal sea level rose to a new record high in 2015. It measured about 2.75 inches (70 mm) higher than that observed in 1993, when satellite record-keeping for global sea level rise began.\n\nTropical cyclones were well above average, overall. There were 101 tropical cyclones total across all ocean basins in 2015, well above the 1981-2010 average of 82 storms. The eastern/central Pacific had 26 named storms, the most since 1992. The North Atlantic, in contrast, had fewer storms than most years during the last two decades.\n\nThe Arctic continued to warm; sea ice extent remained low. The Arctic land surface temperature in 2015 was 2.2 degrees F (1.2¬∞C) above the 1981-2010 average, tying 2007 and 2011 as the highest on record. The maximum Arctic sea ice extent reached in February 2015 was the smallest in the 37-year satellite record, while the minimum sea ice extent that September was the fourth lowest on record.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Amit Sethi", "channel": "UCHGdogpcHFH9phv-ElJsJ5Q", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQGWIb33bbDRA4xtVxfHtmM9MkgN164QVdRKIio6A=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The computer models just weren‚Äôt reliable. In fact I‚Äôm\n not sure the whole thing isn‚Äôt crazy, this climate change. You‚Äôve only \ngot to look at Singapore. It‚Äôs two-and-a-half times higher than the \nworst-case scenario for climate change, and it‚Äôs one of the most \ndesirable cities in the world to live in.‚Äù\nBesides, he says, nature is more powerful than the computer models:\nIt‚Äôs only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board.\nLovelock was speaking in an interview with the fervently alarmist \nGuardian whose interviewer Decca Aitkenhead was naturally somewhat taken\n aback by his views which she ascribed in part to his temperament as an \n‚Äúincorrigible subversive.‚Äù\nBut Lovelock himself insists that it is simply a question of looking at the evidence.\nOne experience that has sharply concentrated his thoughts is the cost\n of heating his home, an old mill in Devon. When the heating bills rose \nto ¬£6,000 for just six months, he realised that he would have to \ndownsize and has now moved to a smaller cottage¬†on¬†Chesil Beach in \nDorset. This claim has brought him into conflict with another green \nguru, the chunky knit Guardianista George Monbiot.\n‚ÄúI remember George Monbiot took me up on it\n and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn‚Äôt \nlying, I‚Äôve got the figures.‚Äù Monbiot doesn‚Äôt quite accuse him of lying,\n in fairness; just of ‚Äútalking rubbish‚Äù and ‚Äúmaking wild statements‚Äù. In\n any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six\n months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just ¬£60. As a result, he \nhas withering contempt for environmentalists‚Äô opposition to fracking. \n‚ÄúYou see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,‚Äù he \nsays. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his \neyes.\n‚ÄúSure enough, that‚Äôs true, there will be an increase. But they‚Äôre \ntiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is \nthat you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I‚Äôve spent a\n lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the \nmoment somebody can detect something, they‚Äôre going to attach a number \nto it, and then they make a fuss about it.‚Äù He chuckles, then pauses. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not anti-green in the sense that I‚Äôm in favour of polluting the \nworld with every damn thing we make. I think we‚Äôve got to be careful. \nBut I‚Äôm afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets \nexaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved \ndeplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.‚Äù\nBesides Monbiot, Lovelock finds time for a little dig at yet another fervent green catastrophist the Prince of Wales:\nHe was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told \nPrincess Anne: ‚ÄúYour brother nearly killed me.‚Äù Having read that Prince \nCharles had installed grass-burning boilers\n at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs supposed to \nsmoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn‚Äôt, because it goes out, \nand clouds and clouds of smoke come out.‚Äù He giggles. ‚ÄúPrincess Anne \nthought this was hilariously funny.‚Äù\nHis heretical stance on nuclear energy too is likely to alienate many of his former admirers in the green movement:\n\n\n\n\nEven more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock‚Äôs passionate support for nuclear power.\n But, like fracking, he says, it offers only ‚Äúa stopgap‚Äù solution. \n‚ÄúBecause in the long term, they‚Äôll use up all the uranium.‚Äù How long \nwould that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as \ncasually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from \nSainsburys.\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see ‚Ä¶ I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last\n about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you‚Äôve \nused all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times\n as long as uranium ‚Äì so, shall we say, about 200 years?‚Äù The most \nsensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in\n solar panels. ‚ÄúIt would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy \nthey needed,‚Äù but it won‚Äôt happen ‚Äúbecause it would be so easy for \nterrorists to go and bugger it up‚Äù. So for now, nuclear energy is the \nonly viable option.\nNot that any of this matters much anyway, Lovelock suggests, because \nby the end of the century robots will have taken over and they probably \nwon‚Äôt find much use for us.\nThe implications for climate change are obvious. ‚ÄúThe \nworld that they‚Äôre going to be comfortable in is wildly different from \nthe one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get \nestablished, they will ‚Äì with regret ‚Äì start losing organic life.‚Äù Will \nthey care about rising temperatures? ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt give a fourpenny fuck \nabout the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they\n can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate \ninfinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before \nthings get tricky for them. It‚Äôs what the world can stand that is the \nimportant thing. They‚Äôre going to have a safe platform to live in, so \nthey don‚Äôt want Gaia messed about too much.‚Äù", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "don jenkins", "channel": "UCMHIZdLJCNxBX0iOx0SBQGQ", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTHCe2Rbq1DKBBHBFgS8DD9S66vJwo0bE8UpttX=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

The rise in CO2 is due to human activity not any else. A rise in CO2 is predicted to cause the global temperature to rise in the pattern observed.

The rise in temperature is not steady, in part because of the way the oceans absorb the heat, in part due to volcanic activity, in part due to particular and sulphur dioxide emissions and likely in part due to the limitations in estimating global temperature in any year. It has been determined that the global rise in temperature over the last 100 years is almost entirely attributable to human activity.

Are you suggesting that the greenhouse effect has been proven? If so, how?\nYou then claim that Michael Faraday was correct. Are you suggesting that everything that Michael Faraday said was correct. I am not playing word games here. There is a general acceptance of many physical principles, but all of them can be found to based on an incorrect belief, and that current theory may fail in conditions that have not yet been tested. And even in the conditions that have been tested, it is an assumption that an experiment will always behave as predicted. There is absolutely no way of proving that something will definitely happen, however we have great confidence in things because they seem to follow a pattern.\nYou are using the word 'fact' carelessly also. In science a fact is an observation, or data that we use to support or disprove an hypothesis. In general terms a fact is something that is accepted as true. Whether something is described as a fact or not is dependent on the audience and the context. Some may well claim that it is a fact that CO2 is the reason why the earth's temperature has gone up, they are that certain. The problem is that the people that are very certain are not the sort of people who would use the word fact in that manner, and the people who might use the word in that manner don't know enough to be confident of calling it a fact. This is one the many problems science has in communicating with the general public. What they say is interpreted differently depending on who is hearing it.\n\n\"More interesting is that scientists now understand clearly that this huge flame ball called the sun is 99% responsible for the earths temperature.\" - what does that mean? How do you get that measurement of 99%? If you consider a case when the sun is there to when it is not the answer would be 100%. If you consider the case of when the greenhouse effect is there and not the answer is 90%. And I haven't even moved on to considering seasons. In any case it is not the magnitude of the contribution (if that could be measured), but the magnitude of the contribution to any change over a particular time scale. Let me put it this way - you could argue that in a perfectly insulated building where the temperature is controlled by a AC unit that the electricity is 100% responsible for the temperature. But it is the people who set actually control the temperature so maybe they are 100% responsible.\n\n\"The planets temperature will start decreasing because suns activity has started to decrease\" - what time scale are you talking on? There is a 11 year cycle, but that doesn't affect the long term trend. The long term trend of the sun is to get warmer, and this will result in the extinction of all complex life forms in 500 million year's time.\n\n\"Earths climate is something we would never be able to control.\" - what do you base that claim on? Why would that be impossible? Apparently you know something that climatologists don't.\n\n\"Recycling, turning off devices when we don tuse them, taking the bus instead of your car etc that is all great stuff\" - what has this got to do with whether or not the heating over the last 100years is anthropogenic? \n\n\"Interfering with nature is something terrible humans do and they should stop immediately.\" - that is impossible.

Gaseous molecules, of any sort, reflect or refract light.  And light being any wavelength in or outside the visible spectrum (ROYGBIV).  Each atom does this, and is why you see certain colors on fabric, in the rainbow, and in your daily life.  CO2, of any isotope (difference atomic mass) refracts UV, and other light waves (and particles).  The light that does make it to the surface and bounces off after passing some energy (infrared heat), cannot or finds it difficult to escape the upper atmosphere.  It continues to be sent back and forth until eventually it escapes.  Heat is transferred from the light, as its component of kinetic energy.  So, the Earth's surface will heat up, however little it does.  Now, that I've laid that out, let's use it to discuss your water experiment.  If you have H2O in your pot, and regardless of temp, unless frozen, some of those molecules will escape the \"liquid\" phase, as other atoms in the air have transferred kinetic energy to the H2O, just by colliding with another molecule, which can be enough to break the hydrogen-bonds with other molecules.  As the liquid is supplied with heat, the molecules vibrate more and more, and thus the volume of the liquid will expand, at the molecular level.  How does it apply to the large scale?  Well, if you were to put a lid on it, if you're cooking rice or potatoes for example, you've reduced the ability for gaseous molecules to escape.

{"cid": "UggmHRGP8CgM7HgCoAEC.8HM87avkc4L8KqcyWgL93X", "text": "man bear pig The earth has been heating and cooling over billions of years because of the solar cycle. This solar cycle is caused by the sun spots that appear when there is more solar activity. When there is more solar activity, there are less clouds and when there is less solar activity then there are more clouds. Clouds are linked to cosmic rays, so when there are more cosmic rays the temperature is colder. The amount of cosmic rays hitting the earth is linked to the solar activity. Everything we know about climate change is linked back to the sun. Climate change is real, but it's not caused by CO2. You have to realize how little CO2 is in the air compared to other greenhouse gases. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor. People also talk about the melting of the Antarctic and I want you to know that when you see a video of the ice breaking off, this is about as naturally occurring as leaves from from a tree. Ice is always moving, the ice in in Antarctic is also going through a cycle where it expands and contracts. There is a connection between CO2 and temperature, but it's not that CO2 is what drives temperature. It's the fact that temperature drives CO2. The Ocean has a memory of the temperature of our past. The ocean is so big that for it to heat and cool it takes hundreds of years for the actual temperature of the ocean to change from whatever event happened. It's almost the same as when you look at a star and what you're seeing is what occurred long ago. There is a lag between temperature and CO2 because of how long it takes the ocean to heat and cool. The warmer it is, the more CO2 will be released and the colder it is more CO2 will be sucked in by the ocean. Humans are not emitting CO2 at a rate where it's causing climate change, volcanoes give off more CO2 than people, cars, and factories do combined. There is no direct connection between higher CO2 levels leading to higher temperature. In the last 120 years, most of the temperature change happened even before the post war economic boom. If CO2 were to have a connection to temperature, then the years after the war should have been a time where the temperature was rising but instead the opposite happened.

{"cid": "UggmHRGP8CgM7HgCoAEC.8HM87avkc4L8KyYv8At7s0", "text": "That's a very important question. Recently solar activity has started to decrease and in the past this always meant that the earth should be cooling as well but instead we've seen an increase in temperatures. Scientists need more time to gather data to explain the recent changes to climate, this is why it is such a popular topic. There are many different theories to why this is happening. When the surface temperature of the earth increases, the temperature of the upper layer of the atmosphere should be increasing rapidly but scientists have seen that it hasn't been drastic at all. If this were to be true, then the theory that greenhouse gases are even effecting climate change at all would be false. In my opinion, there must be a factor that has shown up recently that has never shown up before that is causing this rise in temperature. As I said before, temperature is what drives CO2. So in my opinion, if in the past when there were CO2 levels even higher than now, that still means that even in current time it is not effecting climate. One of the most important things to do while discussing climate change is to keep an open mind and see what is to come. Humans might have some sort of effect on climate change but because it's natural, I don't think it will cause anything that we will have to worry about. I'm a Geology major and have had many conversations about this topic with my professors. To make a long story short if someone asks you what you think about climate change, it's safe to say solar activity has definitely had an effect on climate change in the past but recently that might no longer be the case. Not saying it has no effect on temperature at all anymore, just saying there must be another factor contributing to what is happening that is not from CO2 emissions.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Mathew Raimbault", "channel": "UC2m0PkHeo3-HB61qxsLiyjA", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLST8pC1sd9u8QIlDRpBpE5NR68KiulO-6Gn53SzZQc=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'm not looking for a throat to rip or anything--this topic is just a hobby of mine.  I'll address some of these things below, in summary:\n\nRegarding the size of the Earth, it's important to note that we've had global impacts before, such as chlorofluorocarbon emissions and the ozone layer, which is still recovering (to my knowledge) thanks to laws restricting CFC release.  Consider the collection of plastic in the oceans which remains for long periods of time, similar to long-lived greenhouse gasses, like CO2.  That CO2 gets scrubbed from the atmosphere, into the oceans, at a rate which doesn't keep-up with the continuous release.  As a result, it accumulates in the atmosphere.\n\nThe effects of small percentages of CO2 can be amplified by that water vapor you mentioned, and more importantly, cloud cover.  Concerning plant growth and CO2, you must consider the changes in rainfall as well, which are quicker to affect plants.  After all, water is more important than slight CO2 increases to plant growth.  It's likely that as the world warms, the El Nino/La Nina phenomenon will produce an increasing contrast in rainfall.", "time": "4 years ago", "author": "Nicholas Veridiculity", "channel": "UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSBxrJv42mRnncaQSz3aqiMpn2W1lzeY3p6HA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

On that scale we are in fact today barely above the Earth‚Äôs record lows.\n\nThat 400 ppm is actually dangerously low is a fact the alarmists keep avoiding and suppressing. Below 150 ppm, plant-life dies off on a massive scale. The Earth actually came very close to that point many times over the last 2 million years during the ice ages. At the bottom of the last ice age just 20,000 years ago, life on the planet literally \nteetered on the brink¬†when CO2 fell to a¬†level of just 180 ppm.

It‚Äôs a fact that biologists have shown that once the atmospheric CO2 level falls below the 500 ppm level, plants really begin to suffer.\n\nNo one disputes that man‚Äôs activities have helped to increase atmospheric CO2 concentration, and it should not be in dispute that plants and life on the planet are thankful that man has done so.

This does not conclude human impact is the cause. \n\n97% is a nonsensical number that was put forward by a graduate student in their thesis. This has been debunked and proven inaccurate quite a while ago. Scott, it is vital to keep a neutral stance in science and navigate your consensuses based on the end roots of the scientific method. \n\nWe cannot predict climate patterns to any degree of accuracy, our models are 65p at theoretical variability (lets not even talk practical) - where is the certainty that you speak of? Our planet is a rock full of microbes and geochemical concentration gradients in atmospheric layers. We are orbiting a star with a dwindling magnetic pole with an ever changing spin orientation, within solar cycling and an uncertainty in our oceans behaviour. The gravitational stress is highly variable on our atmosphere and our wobble is extremely difficult to predict.  Excuse me for doubting the absolute certainty of our planets character. I have read over 1,000 scientific papers in this field. A marine biologist who works in the field of coral reefs is going to naturally link carbonic acidity to bleaching, which they then are going to more than likely link to anthropogenic climate change. This is an opinion using carbon concentration as the foundation for an argument. This does not mean that it is true, leaked deep ocean carbonic acid that we have not explored could be responsible for differing oceanic geochemistry. The variability of IR Radiation on the plant could perpetuate a higher or lower yield of energy regulation and chemical degradation. A marine biologist is not trained in atmospheric physics or geochemistry and therefore who's analysis of the earth should be put into context. \n\nThere is a high certainty that a species of 7+ billion whom is mining and chemically altering gaseous byproducts is most likely going to impact the earth in some way. We could very well be the leading cause behind our variability and the reason our evidence is not substantial is due to lagging chemical concentration gradients or a completely different reason that we are not aware of. However, we haven't PROVED anything. If you read an article that says \"hottest on record\" - that is a bias. On what record? Who recorded this? How did they record this? What exactly are they recording? How long have they been recording?

Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth‚Äôs orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human-induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years.1\nEarth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale.

How much does it multiply it?\"\n\nWater vapor is seen as an amplifying force because you can't have more long term water vapor in a given climate without increasing the temperatures first because of this magical process known as condensation. If it's not in the atmosphere it can't act as a green house gas.\n\n\" The point of the science is policy? Do we agree on that? \"\n\nNo, the point of the science is to inform what's most likely to be true, policy is independent because politicians not scientists make the laws and set policy, they do so all the time in contradiction to the best science.\n\n\"The answer we still have is X to 3X.\"\n\nIt's a statistical statement, and it's actually closer to x and 2.25x. If the only factor at play were CO2 it'd be a pretty easy calculation since it's a simple blackbody calculation. the range is to signify the various other factors at play which can include unknown knowns.\n\n\" Nothing of what you wrote deals with whether we are the cause of most of this?\"\n\nYou never asked and don't seem all that interested.\n\nIt's actually pretty easy, different forms of warming have different fingerprints, We can attribute warming to different sources based on specific fingerprints. There are several fingerprints unique to CO2 based warming and it's the strongest fingerprint in the instrumental record.\n\nFor example CO2 will warm the lower troposphere but actually cool the upper atmosphere (this has been observed), We can detect the increase in downwards long wave radiation along the specific wavelengths of the ghgs involved (as different ghgs absorb different wavelengths of light, which is also observed), we can calculate the increase of energy that would give us.\n\nEven if we had zero long term data on the topic the fact that you can test the physical mechanism and perform such an attribution study is what indicates it's most likely to be the primary cause of recent warming. If you presented nothing more than this to me with regards to recent data, I would be hard pressed to find fault with it because it's so specific in nature.\n\nArguing \"we don't have enough long term data\" is like if I heated a pot of water with ignited propane gas, I measured the light spectrum it emitted, the heat it emitted, measured the gas being burned, and how the pot of water heated from the bottom up and then arguing that I didn't know what the pot was doing 50 years ago so I can't attribute current warming to the flame.\n\nIf you want a similar analogy to the pot, maybe I try and heat it using different methods, you can still determine what's the most likely cause of most of the warming by testing the different specific mechanisms and find the most likely cause of most of the warming. While it'll be more difficult to find what warmed the pot 50 years ago, it doesn't invalidate all of the specific measurements and mechanisms because I don't have data from that pot from 50 years ago, particularly when I'm talking about what's causing the warming now.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "0", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

I'd be happier with a grid cell size of 1 km and that's still going to miss a lot. \n\nWhen looking at the longwave spectrum yes, that has changed. CO2 is doing what they said it would. What about everything thing else? I keep looking at Humlum's water vapor data. It's flat. And has been as CO2 keeps rising. Call it a fingerprint of CO2 alone and not the expected water vapor. Why haven't they done a similar study showing the expected increased water vapor?

Looks like he used a GCM comparing natural to CO2 forced runs.\"\n\nIt's pretty much a natural result of the physics of more long wave radiation staying in the troposphere, ergo not getting into the upper stratosphere resulting in less energy reaching it in a set amount of time for a given amount of sunlight.\n\n\"I keep looking at Humlum's water vapor data.\"\n\nYeah, going to need you to cite your sources on this one.\n\nhttp://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI3990.1\n\n\"we told you was going to be there too.\"\n\nWho's this \"we\", how many of you are there in there?\n\n\"You are quoting the IPCC on the 95% certainty. \"\n\nThere are differences between levels of statistical confidence based on attribution studies and number of practicing scientists that are convinced to that degree and producing relevant scientific literature.\n\nMy claim was on the statistical attribution studies for which the polled scientists may or may not be aware of. Even then most are convinced that it's still the primary cause of most of the warming even if not to the 95th percentile.\n\nNot to mention the source of your post is well, dubious, but I'll even grant it.\n\nA main issue is that the side claiming to be skeptics still don't care to explain the phenomenon with their own hypothesis and ones that are often the most popular are actually very easy to disprove with the observations. Much like in the day of cigarette campaigns trying to focus on the uncertainties in lung cancer causes it only focuses on known weaknesses while ignoring the data on hand that give reasonable certainty.\n\nLike \"it's the sun\" can be disproved by several different angles including we have direct observations of the sun, there's no mechanism by which the sun would simultaneously warm the troposphere but cool the upper stratosphere, that the sun would warm the poles quicker than the equator, that events like the laschamp anomaly bring into great question the idea that cosmic rays could be a primary factor in effecting long term climate.\n\nThe reason why popular skeptics don't really make positive declarations any more is because they've been dismissed by the physics and observations, it's easier to try and knock anything down than it is to actually support something.\n\nI don't claim to be an expert, but the vast majority of evidence is convincing to me with regards to the topic and skeptic arguments are drastically lacking in this regard. Again when it comes to planning for the future you still go with what is most likely true based on your best available information.\n\nEveryone already agrees that we would like better data, but nothing changes the fact that we still only have what we have, skeptics need to produce something better if they really want things to go in another direction with regards to this topic rather than whining that it'll never be good enough because (for some reason) we need things like a thousand years more data because no one in the skeptic community can really seem to determine what's \"enough data\" to be convinced of a trend or a mechanism.

Evolution is driven by random mutation + natural selection. Random mutation over the course of only 2 generation per 1 century is incredibly small.

We have homes, hats, and sunblock all which protect us from heat. Natural selection isn't going to affect humans a lot. It will affect us in directly through food/water sources.\n\nBut the more important concerning factor is the life of other animals which would be threatened, thus affecting our food supply. Fresh water sources will be devastated as well since rivers and lakes wlll shrink. \n\nThe only way we'll \"evolve\" to be better at living in warmer temperature is, black melanin rich skin, more sweat glands,  taller and skinnier bodies (better heat dissipation).

I found interesting what Geoffrey Vallis said in his talk (and book) about the role of the oceans in slowing down global warming. Basically he said that if global warming does not turn out to be a serious problem this century it will in centuries to come because of the \"long tail\" of co2 in the atmosphere (something David Archer explains well) and the increase in the  greenhouse effect of co2. This is assuming we just keep on burning everything we can get our hands on. On the subject of methane, David Archer expressed less concern about a huge slug of methane added to the atmosphere as compared to a persistent increase in co2 because methane gets cycled out in about 12 years whereas co2 takes centuries.

Man, there's just something about that long debunked factoid that's just irresistible to these propagandists. Wanna know how someone is brainlessly spouting propaganda bullcrap about MMGW? Listen for the \"97% of Scientists agree\" line. This little factoid has been endlessly repeated by the propagandists, and it has actually already been thoroughly debunked.\n\nFor those who haven't heard, that statistic was based on the most manipulative, (and outright dishonest) practices of John Cook, an Australian \"Scientist\" back in 2009 who counted pretty much ANY paper that mentioned Global Warming as support for MMGW, leading a team of \"researchers\" (not scientists) to read, not the scientific papers submitted in 2009, but mainly just the abstracts of the papers, and even then it was confirmed that his 'researchers' concluded the OPPOSITE position that the authors of the papers themselves were demonstrating, something like 60% of the time. The Cook assertion that \"97% of Scientists agree\" is not science, it is bald-faced propaganda meant to appeal to the listener's cognitive bias (bandwagon fallacy). (Or in most cases, blind religious belief that we humans are evil, harmful parasites on the earth)\n\nWanna know why the 97%-myth is even dumber to use? Even if the 97% myth were true, \"consensus\" does not equal \"truth\". At one point it was the \"Scientific consensus\" that the Earth was the center of the Solar System. Did that mean that was true? \n\nNope. \n\nIt was the \"Scientific consensus\" at one time that if you got sick, doctors should cut you and let you bleed out the sickness. Was that true?\n\nNope.\n\nFor someone to point to this 97% myth as supportive evidence of the truthfulness of their weird neo-pagan religion, it's either ignorance or dishonesty. It's just pathetic.\n\nCome on, Bill, I love ya, but if your side is right, if there is real reason and evidence that you can stand on, why this weird need to keep endlessly spitting out the debunked 97% factoid? Because MMGW has NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE. It is a political agenda that is being pushed on us, using our good intentions against us. \n\nPeople who actually value truth over cognitive biased-affirming myths won't fall for this crap.

{"cid": "UgilFnwxaU1m_XgCoAEC", "text": "First, Bill Nye is not a science guy. Feel free to research his degree which is not in science. Although most people who respond to this video know nothing of history, do yourself a favor and read Einstein's biography. More than 97% of the scientist of his time did not believe his theory of relativity since it disagreed with some of newtons basic theories. Having a majority of scientist who get paid by being alarmist does not make a fact true. Combined this with reports that don't get published so often of scientists who disagree with these theories. Look up the French and Russian scientist who core drilled a 2 mile sample at the North Pole to find out that the carbon levels 20,000 years ago were much higher than today. Cute videos with subjective and cherry picked data do not make a fact. This guy gets paid for being an alarmist. One should also not confuse pollution and global warming. Pollution is real in needs to be contained. But there is no scientific link between pollution in global warming. While other studies show a decrease in the earth's temperature and a build up of glacier ice, the global warning community had to change their own science term from global warming to climate change. Those who remember to 1970s remember that 97% of the scientist at the time said we were heading toward an ice age. 10 years ago Al Gore and company predicted that half of New York City would be underwater by now. Stop being sheep people. Come up with your own data based on research. Don't listen to these talking heads who have a political and financial agenda. Climate scientist cannot even predict rain two days away or the track hurricanes accurately. Who in their right mind would trust these weather scientist computer models of global warning to be accurate. It's all about the Benjamin's people. Big business is in business to make money and destroying the world is counterproductive to that. However, governments look for new ways to tax people and carbon tax is a great way to add money to government coffers and control the populations of the world. Also scientist only get paid (funded) if there are problems. No one wants to fund a scientist to do weather research if there are no issues. Just because you're a scientist doesn't mean that you're not a dishonest individual just trying to pay their mortgage by any means possible. I am quite sure that this post will be hated and I will be called a climate change denier or some other offensive term. Equating the term \"denier\" which originates from the holocaust which was a true event that extinguished 15 million lives is another desperate tool used by these climate¬†demigods to stifle opposite opinion instead of having real dialogue.

For example the ways we exited snowball earth is CO2 would build up in the atmosphere from volcanic activity and not be sequestered into an ice covered ocean till CO2 concentrations got so high that it warmed the atmosphere enough to melt the multi mile thick ice.\n\n\nFor most cases in recent history natural factors, usually milankovitch cycles would change how much solar energy effects certain parts of the earth. To exit ice ages its various factors would result in more direct sunlight on the icy north and gradually warm the oceans. As the oceans warmed they gradually out gas CO2 which would mix in the atmosphere and delay heat dissipation which would create more warming and cause other feedbacks like long frozen biological mass decaying or frozen micro organisms producing methane and melt more ice till it reaches equilibrium or another forcing counter acts or reenforces the feedback loops.\n\n\n\nThe proper question you should be asking is \"how do we know the mechanism that is causing the warming today\". Different causes of warming have different finger prints of how it should warm. Like carbon gases will warm as much at night as much as the day, they'll warm at the poles, particularly higher latitudes quicker than at the equator, it'll warm the troposphere while cooling the stratosphere and a few other markers I can't remember off the top of my head. This is all actually within the instrumental record which is why the vast majority of relevant experts can point to the most likely cause of most of the warming over the last few decades.\n\n\nIf I were to say \"it's the sun\" well we have direct observations of the sun telling us this isn't the case, but even if it were, we'd expect the sun to warm areas like the equator faster, we'd expect it to warm at day faster than at night and we'd expect it to warm all of the layers of the atmosphere fairly uniformly. If you want to say cosmic rays, well there's no indication it's these either and historical events like the Laschamp anomaly indicate that cosmic rays don't really have a large effect on climate if they do at all. If you want to say it's orbital forces...well those won't be significant factors for another few thousand years and frankly happen a lot slower than we have been seeing within the instrumental record.", "time": "5 years ago", "author": "garith21", "channel": "UCyCyKozstcPtgQGhEy3hUww", "votes": "1", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ5MUtS7KyK0m-ZL34Xo32uz1h-54SeTmaOsQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false}

{"cid": "Ugh9BrbTXtxlqHgCoAEC.87GwPqI7JLg8SYnHb_wYD9", "text": "You know what? No. I will flood you with the evidence that people from my grandfathers generation were not stupid like you assume them to be and were well aware of environmental changes and the dangers of them AND how it would impact future generations. First,  In New England (where my entire lineage is from and resides today) , many farmers became uneasy as they noticed clearing of forest changed stream flows and a decrease in bird population which helped control insects and other pests. These concerns become widely known with the publication of Man and Nature released in 1864 by George Perkins Marsh (57 years before my grandfather was born). The environmental impact method was used to determine how to proceed in situations that are detrimental to the environment by choosing the way that is least damaging and has the fewest lasting implications. In the 1870s sportsman magazines such as American Sportsmen, Forest and Stream, and Field and Stream led to the growth of the conservation movement. This conservation movement also urged the establishment of state and national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and national monuments intended to preserve noteworthy natural features. Conservation groups focus primarily on an issue that's origins are routed in general expansion. As Industrialization became more prominent as well as the increasing trend towards Urbanization the conservative environmental movement began. Contrary to popular belief conservation groups are not against expansion in general, instead they are concerned with efficiency with resources and land development. Conservation first became a national issue during the progressive era's conservation movement 1890s - 1920s (Right around then my Pappy was born). My Pappy was born in the U.S. when the environmental movement was well under way. He was born into an environmentally conscious society. Theodore Roosevelt became a prominent conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief adviser on the matter, Gifford Pinchot. Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first conservation President. He encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land for national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined. In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: \"Conservation as a National Duty.\". Other influential conservationists of the Progressive Era included George Bird Grinnell (a prominent sportsmen who founded the Boone and Crockett Club), the Izaak Walton League and John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club in 1892. Conservationists organized the National Parks Conservation Association, the Audubon Society, and other groups that still remain active. Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933‚Äì45), like his cousin Theodore Roosevelt, was an ardent conservationist. He used numerous programs of the departments of Agriculture and Interior to end wasteful land-use, mitigate the effects of the Dust Bowl, and efficiently develop natural resources in the West. One of the most popular of all New Deal programs was the Civilian Conservation Corps (1933‚Äì1943 when my Pappy was 11), which sent two million poor young men to work in rural and wilderness areas, primarily on conservation projects. The Inter-American Conference on the Conservation of Renewable Natural Resources met in 1948 (Pappy is 27 years old and 2 years from having a baby boy) as a collection of nearly 200 scientists from all over the Americans forming the trusteeship principle that:\n\n\"No generation can exclusively own the renewable resources by which it lives. We hold the commonwealth in trust for prosperity, and to lessen or destroy it is to commit treason against the future\"\n\nSo there you have it. I need go no further. By 1948, before his first child was born, the message was starting to spread. Treason against the future. Well it doesn't take a genius to realize what that means. It is not time the are worried about but the people in it. But I digress and will go on.\n\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, several events occurred which raised the public awareness of harm to the environment caused by man. In 1954, the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel Lucky Dragon was exposed to radioactive fallout from a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll, in 1969, an ecologically catastrophic oil spill from an offshore well in California's Santa Barbara Channel, Barry Commoner's protest against nuclear testing, Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, Paul R. Ehrlich's The Population Bomb all added anxiety about the environment. Pictures of Earth from space emphasized that the earth was small and fragile.\n\nAs the public became more aware of environmental issues, concern about air pollution, water pollution, solid waste disposal, dwindling energy resources, radiation, pesticide poisoning (particularly as described in Rachel Carson's influential Silent Spring, 1962), noise pollution, and other environmental problems engaged a broadening number of sympathizers. That public support for environmental concerns was widespread became clear in the Earth Day demonstrations of 1970. Five years before I, my grandfathers grandson, was born. Prior to the 1970s the protection of basic air and water supplies was a matter mainly left to each state. During the 1970s, primary responsibility for clean air and water shifted to the federal government. Growing concerns, both environmental and economic, from cities and towns as well as sportsman and other local groups, and senators such as Maine's Edmund S. Muskie, led to passage of extensive legislation, notably the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. Other legislation included National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law in 1970, which established a United States Environmental Protection Agency and a Council on Environmental Quality; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974) all before I was born. \n\nSo publications had been made, clubs had been formed, presidents and scientists spoke of it publicly, bills passed, acts enacted, committees formed, laws passed threats of treason to future generations made ALL BEFORE I WAS BORN and I can tell you from first hand conversation and the fact that my grandparents lived off the grid and self sustaining that they were well aware of what the stakes were. \n\nAnd with that I turn the floor over to you. To disprove my claim you must disprove all those things and the personal experience I had with my own Pappy.

I kept a copy of the US Standard Atmosphere (1962,1976) because it clarifies so much (and dismisses CO2 and methane and...as just trace gases).  There is also an International Standard Atmosphere, as you mentioned, and they agree on all the salient points of physics and chemistry.  There's no magic ping-pong of IR between molecules that make up 0.04%v (0.06%wt) of the atmosphere, and the claims of such magic is appropriate to astrology or pre-Renaissance theology, not science.\n\nI realized there is an excellent analogy for the issue: Take 1,000,000 grains (about 11 kG) of typical beach sand.  Let it warm up (in the Sun or in a warm room) and measure the temperature.  Now take out 400 grains and replace them with 400 grains of black sand, and repeat the trial, with the new mix of 999,600 grains of white sand and 400 grains of black.  There will be no measurable difference in the sand temperatures in the two trials,  Then, after whatever warming is done, remove the sand of the two trials to a cool spot, and measure the decline in temperature over time.  I'm sure you won't be surprised to be unable to detect a difference that is not experimental error.  Do it again with wet sand, or add seltzer water so there's CO2 in there too.\n\nI'd like to ask one thing...that you lose the all-caps shout.

It goes in regular cycles. Sometimes those cycles even prove catastrophic. The reality, however, is that we didn't have to push it... because, in so-doing, we have shortened the duration of change, and therefore increased its severity. THAT'S THE SCIENCE! And it's not that difficult to understand.\n\nNow, I understand that there are many who do not want to believe in said science (at least, no one with vested business interests). However, that doesn't make the science any less real, or the consequences any less dire.\n\nIt comes down to this: If you define life as a complex collection of mechanisms, then you can (and should) just as readily define the earth itself as a living being. And like all living beings it has an immune system. If we trigger that immune system (as science is suggesting we have) then we should expect all manner of tragedies to befall us: hurricanes; floods; droughts; famines; possibly even earthquakes -- all of EPIC, some might even say BIBLICAL proportions. And if you take the latter stance, then you can't say you weren't warned! But, of course, that warning came from a source that is easily mocked, and even more easily disregarded in lieu of \"PROGRESS\" -- a term which refers more to the evolution of MONEY, than of anything LIVING.\n\nSo, the fight has ALWAYS been about stopping the machine before it devours everything in sight. And it always will be, for as long as the threat remains.
